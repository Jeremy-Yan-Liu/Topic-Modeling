9/12/2010	Days of Thunder	''The '57 Thunderbird is elegant, sporty -- it's a gentleman's sports car,'' says Evan Yurman, the design director of men's jewelry and watches for David Yurman, not to mention a vintage car buff. Evan, who is the son of David Yurman, might very well be describing the company's brand-new Classic 1957 Limited Edition watch, a sporty, elegant and, yes, gentlemanly timepiece that was inspired by cars from the '50s and the Thunderbird's instrument panel in particular. ''I drive these kinds of cars a lot, and I'm always staring at the speedometer to see where I'm at,'' he says. For Yurman, the '50s were the golden era of American design, and not just in the automobile industry. ''I tip my hat to it and hope I can only add to this legacy.'' When it comes to cars, however, it's ultimately what's under the hood that gets him revved up: he loves the '57 T-Bird for its beauty more than its brawn. ''It is a cruiser, a cream puff,'' says Yurman, who instead owns a '66 Bel Air and a '69 Ford Mustang. ''I go for the one where some guy in the factory said, 'Let's make this car as fast as we can.' '' ALIX BROWNE

Ford, which is run by William Clay Ford Jr., has agreed to give a fleet of new vehicles to the Detroit Lions, owned by his father, William Clay Ford Sr., as part of an agreement to name the Lions' domed stadium after the automaker, or the family, or something.

4/30/2006	JOB 1: MAKE HIS DAY	Ford Motor's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., has invited a half-dozen of his top executives to northern Michigan today to beat up on him. Mr. Ford is host for a three-day retreat at an undisclosed site where he will ask his leadership team to critique his performance as C.E.O., and to suggest ways he can be a better leader. ''What do they need from me? How do I need to change?'' he said in an interview last week. Those who will be giving Mr. Ford his job evaluation include Mark Fields, Ford's president for the Americas; Anne Stevens, the chief operating officer for the Americas; and Don LeClair, the company's chief financial officer.
4/27/2006	Bush to Meet Big 3 for Talks On Fuel Issues And Pensions	President Bush, who touched a nerve this year when he told Detroit carmakers to build ''relevant'' vehicles, will meet with the companies' leaders next month, William Clay Ford Jr., the chief executive of Ford Motor, said Wednesday. People involved in planning the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the high level of the talks, said it would focus on three areas: energy and the environment; costs like pensions and health care premiums that add hundreds of dollars to the price of a Detroit car; and how currency issues affect the Japanese automakers.
4/23/2006	Energy Politics on Earth Day As Bush Tours California	President Bush spent an Earth Day marked by record-high gas prices promoting his support for hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars, but Democrats said that the vehicles were years away from reality and that the president needed to do more to relieve sticker shock at the pump. Such was the state of the political battle over gas prices on Saturday, when Mr. Bush went to West Sacramento to tour the California Fuel Cell Partnership, a consortium of 31 car makers, energy companies and government agencies, and Democrats fired off press releases from Washington attacking the administration's energy plans.
4/22/2006	All Eyes on the Fed as Gas Prices and Inflation Rise	OIL prices climbed even higher this week, setting a nominal record on the New York Mercantile Exchange and stoking concern about inflation. After jumping on reports earlier in the week that the Federal Reserve might soon stop raising interest rates, the stock market retreated on the assumption that inflation would force the Fed to continue reining in the economy. DICEY PRICES -- Led by soaring gasoline prices, the inflation rate spiked last month, and for the first time some analysts detected evidence that volatile energy prices were beginning to seep into the rest of the economy and push up the cost of living generally.
4/22/2006	High Costs Push Ford To Sharp Loss	The Ford Motor Company posted its sharpest loss in more than four years Friday, deepening concern about the progress of its turnaround efforts. The high costs of closing plants and cutting jobs, combined with a drop in income from auto sales, led to a loss of $1.19 billion, or 64 cents a share, during the first quarter. That was wider than many on Wall Street had expected and contrasted starkly to a $1.21 billion profit, or 60 cents a share, for the quarter in 2005.
4/19/2006	The Doctor Will See the U.A.W.; Benefits Threatened, Auto Workers Line Up for Elective Procedures	The auto industry's efforts to rein in employee health costs is drawing an expensive reaction, as union workers and their spouses hurry to Michigan doctors for knee replacements and other elective procedures before they lose their comprehensive medical benefits. Hospitals, doctors and insurers have all noticed a surge in demand for elective surgery since last year when Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, led a public relations campaign to prepare auto workers for health care cutbacks, and Delphi, the G.M. parts supplier, filed for bankruptcy protection. Hip, knee and shoulder replacements at the Henry Ford Health System were ''up 20 percent in the second half of last year and remain strong,'' said Robert Riney, chief operating officer of the system, the largest hospital group in the Detroit area.
4/17/2006	A Sponsor and Its Show, Intertwined	LIKE modern-day Medicis hoping to discover the next Da Vinci, marketers are becoming patrons of programming. Increasingly, makers of consumer products are commissioning shows and series to appear on television, computers, cellphones and hand-held devices like iPods -- programs that typically would not be produced without the companies' financial support. Those taking part in the trend toward branded entertainment include Coca-Cola, Ford Motor, General Motors, JetBlue Airways, Meow Mix, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever.
4/16/2006	Life in the Green Lane	IF you make your way over to the Javits Convention Center for the New York International Automobile Show -- or if you've gone to any auto show in the last year or so -- you'll know that hybrid cars are the hippest automotive fashion statement to come along in years. They've become synonymous with the worthy goal of reducing gasoline consumption and dependence on foreign oil and all that this means for a better environment and more stable geopolitics. And yet like fat-free desserts, which sound healthy but can still make you fat, the hybrid car can make people feel as if they're doing something good, even when they're doing nothing special at all. As consumers and governments at every level climb onto the hybrid bandwagon, there is the very real danger of elevating the technology at the expense of the intended outcome -- saving gas.
4/15/2006	Economy Meanders, but Gas Prices Stick to Trend	GOOD and getting better, or weak and getting worse. Both views on the economy had their believers amid mixed signals on energy prices, consumer attitudes, the job market and interest rates this week. STEPPING ON THE GAS -- Just in time for the summer driving season, gasoline prices began to rise across the country, topping $3 a gallon at some stations in New York, Los Angeles and some other major metropolitan areas. The increase was driven by political instability in major oil-producing countries, notably Iran, which is confronting the West over its uranium-enrichment program, and Nigeria, where government opponents have taken to attacking petroleum production plants. Together, these events pushed oil prices above $69 a barrel on world markets.
4/14/2006	Ford to Shut Truck Plants in 2 Cities in '08	The Ford Motor Company said on Thursday that it planned to shut its truck plants in St. Paul and Norfolk, Va., the latest closings as part of its revamping program called the Way Forward. Both plants, which are among the oldest at Ford, will shut in 2008, the automaker said from its headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. Both opened in 1925 and together employ about 4,300 hourly and salaried workers.
4/14/2006	If Detroit Calls, U.S. May Not Replay the Bailout Role	Gasoline prices are rising. Sales of Detroit's carmakers suffer as Japanese brands carve out a growing share of the American market. One of the nation's largest automobile manufacturers flirts with bankruptcy. Sound familiar?
4/13/2006	New Jersey Dump Is Put Back on Superfund List	The Ringwood Mines area in northern New Jersey, which the Ford Motor Company used as a dumping ground in the 1970's and then cleaned, is being put back on the list of the most polluted sites in the country. The federal Environmental Protection Agency announced yesterday that it was returning Ringwood to the Superfund list, a ranking of the nation's worst environmental disasters. That unusual action follows several years of intense pressure from local residents who claimed that the area had never been properly cleaned and that dangerous material left over from the assembly of millions of automobiles in a plant in nearby Mahwah was endangering their health.
4/7/2006	President Of Ford Motor Will Retire	The Ford Motor Company said Thursday that its president, James J. Padilla, would retire July 1. His duties will be assumed by the chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., who is forming an executive operating committee to help him run the company. Mr. Padilla, who is also Ford's chief operating officer, has held those positions since last year. He will give up his seat on Ford's board when he leaves.
4/6/2006	Bankruptcy Not an Option For Ford, Chief Says	Although the American automobile industry is in a precarious state, the chief executive of Ford Motor said Wednesday that he was confident the automaker could solve its financial problems and that a bankruptcy filing was not an option. The executive, William Clay Ford Jr., said the company remained profitable and had plenty of cash on hand.
4/5/2006	The Economics Of Henry Ford May Be Pass	HENRY FORD was 50 years old, and not all that different from a lot of other successful businessmen, when he summoned the Detroit press corps to his company's offices on Jan. 5, 1914. What he did that day made him a household name. Mr. Ford announced that he was doubling the pay of thousands of his employees, to at least $5 a day. With his company selling Model T's as fast as it could make them, his workers deserved to share in the profits, he said.
4/4/2006	At Sears and Ford, Internal Border Wars	Given that the United States is right next door, it is not surprising that some of the biggest companies trading on the Canadian stock exchanges are subsidiaries of large American corporations and that their parents are also their largest shareholders. But as Sears Holdings and Ford Motor are finding, attempts to streamline increasingly global operations by taking Canadian subsidiaries private can prompt protracted legal and financial battles.
4/4/2006	U.S. Vehicle Sales Fall 2.9%, Dragged Down by G.M.	A sharp drop at General Motors helped push down auto sales nationwide in March, despite pitches from American carmakers for consumers to take advantage of the latest deals. G.M.'s ''March Madness'' promotion did little to end the skid in sales, while incentives at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler also seemed to do little to lift overall results.
3/30/2006	Ford Technology Chief to Join Citigroup	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that its technology chief, Marv Adams, was leaving the company effective April 21 to join Citigroup. Nick Smither, 47, will become Ford's new vice president and chief information officer. Mr. Smither was most recently executive director of global technology business operations.
3/28/2006	Driving In From the Past, a Model T Would Want to Park Here	Scratch the surface of this city and you never know what you'll find. On the corner of Broome and Thompson Streets in SoHo, hidden for almost a quarter of a century behind a ''24 hr. Parking'' sign, is a captivating symbol of a bygone era: a terra-cotta medallion depicting a Model T Ford emerging from the Holland Tunnel.
3/19/2006	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Ford Harley-Davidson F-150; This Harley's Not a Hog, but It Is a Ham	I'LL admit right here that I don't understand automotive co-branding. To me, it implies both deference and envy -- your brand is cooler than mine, so can I get in on that? The Ford Harley-Davidson F-150 is a case in point. To create it, Ford dressed up an F-150 SuperCab pickup with a billet-style grille meant to evoke chopper brightwork, 22-inch forged aluminum wheels and plenty of Harley badges inside and out. It's the only F-150 that offers full-time all-wheel drive.
3/15/2006	Still Advertising to Gays, Ford Under Boycott Again	A COALITION of groups that oppose civil rights for gay people is pressing a boycott of the Ford Motor Company, the latest push by religious conservatives to influence how and where companies advertise. The American Family Association -- which has boycotted Target for using the word ''holiday'' instead of ''Christmas'' and Procter & Gamble for supporting the repeal of an antidiscrimination ordinance in Cincinnati that excluded gay people -- has reinstated a boycott trying to force Ford to stop advertising in publications aimed at gay readers.
3/12/2006	Thanks to Detroit, China Is Poised to Lead	VOLKSWAGEN and other carmakers used to prosper by sending outdated factory equipment to China to produce older models no longer salable in the West. But competition has become so fierce here that Honda is about to introduce its latest version of the Civic only several months after it went on sale in Europe, Japan and the United States. Toyota, meanwhile, is assembling its Prius gasoline-electric sedan only in Japan and China. When Ford Motor opened its first production line here in western China just three years ago, it used a layout copied from a Ford factory in the Philippines to produce 20,000 sedans a year based on a small car design taken from Ford operations in India.
3/5/2006	A Style Fest in Switzerland	THIS year's Salon International de l'Automobile, now in full swing, shows how automakers have rediscovered something they ignored at considerable cost: consumers want more stylish cars. A profusion of adventurous designs at the Geneva auto show confirms that the era of automotive Bauhaus is over.
3/4/2006	Chrysler's Goal: Keep Success but Lose Incentives	By all rights, Chrysler should be celebrating its status as the most successful Detroit automaker. Instead, like a tightrope walker facing a stiff gale, Chrysler's ability to keep moving forward is being sorely tested. Proof of that sits in a field across from Willow Run Airport west of Detroit, one of nation's busiest for air cargo traffic. Dozens of Jeeps sit in full view of passing planes and motorists, snow collecting on their hoods and roofs.
3/2/2006	Both Ford And G.M. Scale Back	Both General Motors and Ford said Wednesday they would scale back production in the second quarter, a move that reflects their falling sales and shrinking market share in the United States. As has been the case for much of the last year, Asian automakers' sales grew steadily last month. Honda's sales rose the most, with an 8.7 percent increase. Toyota, which has become accustomed to double-digit monthly gains, had a more modest 2.4 percent increase last month.
2/21/2006	Throwing All Cultures Into the Marketing Pot	MARKETERS are embracing America's mishmash of cultures as the influence of immigrants is felt in areas like cuisine, music, holidays and clothing. ''You don't see it creeping up,'' said Luke Visconti, co-founder and partner in DiversityInc Media, which measures diversity management at large companies and publishes a magazine on the subject. ''You don't see the changes unless you go back and think of it.''
2/19/2006	Editors' Note	An article on Feb. 5 about changes in the American auto market contrasted its two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford, with the next four -- Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Nissan. It said that while those four were expected to have a combined worldwide profit of $22 billion for 2005, G.M. and Ford together had a loss of $6.6 billion worldwide. The article should have noted that G.M. reported a loss of $8.6 billion while Ford reported an overall profit of $2 billion, although Ford lost $1.6 billion from its North American auto operations.
2/19/2006	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Ford Explorer; Polishing a Tarnished Trophy	ITS journey was long, bumpy and perilous, but the Ford Explorer managed to stay at the head of the S.U.V. pack for most of the last 15 years. Since 1990, when the first of nearly six million Explorers found a buyer, Ford's midsize S.U.V. was the No. 1 sport utility until last year (when the Chevy TrailBlazer took the lead). More than that, the Explorer essentially defined the conventional S.U.V. -- that is, family-size wagons built like trucks, with bodies mounted to a frame.
2/12/2006	The Smaller Approach	To the Editor: Re ''Carmakers' Big Idea: Think Small'' (Feb. 5): If they can begin to think in terms of smaller cars with smaller-displacement fuel-efficient engines, G.M. and Ford may well survive.
2/5/2006	Carmakers' Big Idea: Think Small	THE writer E. F. Schumacher would be proud. Across the automobile market in America, there is an evolving realization that small is beautiful. No longer do the industry's two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, dominate the industry -- not in profits, sales or buzz. The hottest action is now taking place among the next four companies: Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, and the Japanese automakers Toyota, Honda and Nissan.
1/29/2006	Putting the Motor City Back in Gear	THE American car industry bled some more last week. Ford said it would cut 30,000 jobs and close 14 plants, while General Motors reported an $8.6 billion loss for 2005. It was, said James P. Womack, a manufacturing expert, ''the sad story of two armies in retreat, a retreat that is feeling more and more like a rout.''
1/25/2006	Ford Ad Draws Criticism Even Before It Is Shown	On Monday, William Clay Ford Jr., chief executive of Ford Motor, made his case to employees, analysts and the media for how his company could survive. On Wednesday, he starts making that case to consumers. Whether they will buy it is another issue.
1/24/2006	Trying to Find the Road Ahead	With its bonds downgraded to junk and its market share on the ropes, Detroit's auto industry almost looks to be in a free fall. Ford Motor Company's announcement yesterday that after three straight quarters of North American losses, it will close as many as 14 factories and eliminate up to 30,000 jobs by 2012 is another sign of dark days in the Motor City. What's really sad is that Ford is in such bad shape that few people think the restructuring and job cuts are too aggressive, even though they were larger than many auto industry analysts had been expecting. That's not all that surprising when you consider that earlier this month, the Chinese automaker Geely did something no Chinese company had ever done. At Detroit's auto show, it unveiled a Chinese car that Geely plans to upgrade and sell in the United States in 2008. The price for what could be China's first foray into America's overheated love affair with cars: around $10,000.
1/24/2006	Many Workers, Few Shifts	Dennis Frantz first started to feel uneasy about the future of his plant about two years ago, and that was when Wixom Assembly still had more than one shift and Mr. Frantz still had a job to do. But workers like Mr. Frantz said they saw the writing on the wall. Ford has since significantly reduced production at the plant, and Mr. Frantz, 61, has gone into the jobs bank, a program that requires Ford to pay workers out of a special fund even if there are no cars for them to build.
1/24/2006	FORD ELIMINATING UP TO 30,000 JOBS AND 14 FACTORIES	The Ford Motor Company said Monday that it would close as many as 14 factories and cut up to 30,000 jobs over the next six years. It was the latest move in a fundamental restructuring of Detroit's traditional auto companies, hit hard by foreign competitors, who have taken more than 40 percent of the American market. The moves by Ford, the second-largest automaker in the United States, come two months after General Motors, the industry leader, said it would close all or part of a dozen factories and eliminate a similar number of jobs.
1/21/2006	Analysts Ask if Ford Overhaul Plan Will Be Spartan Enough	Even before Ford Motor announces a revamping plan on Monday that will cut jobs and close plants, Wall Street is asking whether it will be enough. Many analysts say the overhaul plan, called The Way Forward, will be too little and at least a year too late.
1/19/2006	Ramapough Tribe Sues Ford Over Sludge Dumping in New Jersey	Lawyers representing the Ramapough Mountain Indian Tribe and other residents of Ringwood, N.J., sued the Ford Motor Company yesterday over the dumping of thousands of tons of paint sludge and other toxic material from the company's former assembly plant in nearby Mahwah, N.J. The lawsuit, filed in State Superior Court in Passaic County, claims that Ford caused widespread contamination of the soil and groundwater in a mountainous 900-acre part of Ringwood, near the New York State line, during the 25 years that the Mahwah plant was open. The site includes two abandoned iron mines. Ford closed the Mahwah plant in 1980.

1/13/2006	Toyota Shows Big Three How It's Done; For U.S. Makers, Lessons In Efficiency and Cost Control	As General Motors and Ford struggle to remake themselves and rejoin the car wars, one company is proving what a successful American carmaker can look like: Toyota. Unlike G.M. and Ford, bogged down by dozens of models competing for the same buyers, Toyota has a well-chosen lineup of both bread-and-butter cars and trucks that sell in big volumes as well as luxury models for which it can command a higher price.
1/8/2006	Is There a Future In Ford's Future?	MARK FIELDS has no time to waste -- and no time to become acquainted with employees at Ford Motor, where he is the new president of its American operations. That is why Mr. Fields, who recently returned to Ford's headquarters here in October after three promotions that had taken him to Argentina, Japan and England in the last eight years, has been firing off ''Dear Team'' e-mail messages to employees, outlining the steps that he thinks the company needs to take, and serving as host for internal Webcasts.
1/6/2006	Ford's Debt Is Lowered 2 More Steps	Even before Ford Motor introduces the turnaround plan it is calling The Way Forward, Standard & Poor's clearly thinks that it may not be. S.& P. put Ford's debt rating two notches further into junk on Thursday, less than a month after a similar move at General Motors. It warned that problems at G.M., which S.& P. said might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, could make a Ford comeback more difficult.
12/27/2005	Michigan's Job No. 1: Recovery; Looking to Toyota For a Helping Hand	In another era, Jennifer M. Granholm's courtship of Toyota would have been considered heresy for the governor of Michigan, where American automakers and their suppliers fueled the economic engine for decades. But with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company cutting thousands of jobs, closing plants and eliminating benefits for the shrinking number of workers still employed, the governor is vowing to ''go anywhere, do anything'' to find investment for her state.
12/24/2005	Ford Puts Up More Money To Aid Jaguar	The Ford Motor Company has invested ?1.2 billion ($2.1 billion) in its unprofitable Jaguar unit to help pay for a reorganization at the luxury-car division. A Jaguar spokesman, Don Hume, said yesterday that Ford provided the money by buying preferred shares in the unit. He declined to say how the investment would be used. The amount almost matches the $2.5 billion that Ford paid for Jaguar in 1989.
12/15/2005	Ford to Save $850 Million In New Health Care Pact	Local auto union officials said yesterday that they had approved the Ford Motor Company's demands for lower annual health care costs, saying the agreement would save the automaker $850 million annually. The decision paves the way for a ratification vote by union-represented factory workers. Under the agreement, which was reached last week, active workers at Ford will divert 99 cents an hour in future wage increases to a health fund, while retirees will pay as much as $752 a year per family for medical coverage, Ron Gettelfinger, the president of the United Auto Workers, said.
12/15/2005	Ford, Reversing Decision, Will Run Ads in Gay Press	Less than two weeks after the Ford Motor Company said it would all but eliminate its advertising in publications that cater to gays, the company reversed itself Wednesday. The decision followed a wave of criticism from gay rights groups, who had accused Ford of bowing to the threat of a boycott from the American Family Association.
12/9/2005	Car Plants as Chips in Big-Stakes Game	A high-stakes game of poker is under way in the automobile industry, and Chuck Buchanan is one of the chips. Ford's big luxury-car plant here, where Mr. Buchanan has worked for 32 years, is rumored to be on a list of plants that Ford may close under its second restructuring plan in the last four years.
12/8/2005	Board Is Told of Ford's Overhaul Plan	The board of the Ford Motor Company is meeting this week to consider the latest plan from top executives to turn the struggling automaker around. On Wednesday, Ford's president for operations in North and South America, Mark Fields, presented the board a draft of the overhaul plan, which the company has said will include ''significant plant closings'' and job cuts. Beyond that, details of the plan are not publicly known and have been the subject of conflicting and widespread speculation.
12/6/2005	Under Pressure, Ford Will Cut Its Ads in Gay Publications	After a threatened boycott from a conservative religious organization, the Ford Motor Company has said it will cut back on advertising in gay-oriented publications. The group, the American Family Association, called for the boycott in May because of what it said was the company's ''track record for supporting the homosexual agenda.''
11/26/2005	Workers' Slowdown Cuts Ford Production in Russia	In a labor action unusual for Russia, a slowdown at the Ford Motor factory here has cut into production, as the union prepares to take a strike vote Saturday. The slowdown, begun Tuesday, comes at a delicate time for Ford in Russia. Demand for Ford cars is booming here, but the company has not been able to keep pace. Also, Ford is being undersold by cheaper Asian brands like Hyundai. Ford plans to double production next year and retool its Focus line for new models.
11/4/2005	Ford to Subsidize Ethanol Pumps in Midwest	Ford, in partnership with the ethanol producer VeraSun Energy, plans to announce today that it will subsidize the installation of ethanol fuel pumps at gas stations around the Midwest. Ford also said it would increase the number of vehicles it builds that can burn fuel with as much as 85 percent ethanol. In addition, Ford said it would work with dealers to emphasize the availability of ethanol-burning cars in areas where the fuel is sold.
11/2/2005	Big Drop In October For Detroit	October, which is the start of the new model year, used to be a month for the auto industry to celebrate. This year, it was a month for Detroit to forget. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler held their lowest shares of the American market ever last month. Sales fell in the wake of high gasoline prices, fears about the economy and consumer resistance to buying cars without the big discounts the companies offered this summer.
10/30/2005	Ford Saddles Up New Horses for the Midsize Derby; Milan: Feminine Mystique for Mercury	WHILE automakers sometimes seem clueless about their intended customers, Mercury appears to have a clear vision of whom it expects to drive off in its new Milan: an independent, self-made woman in need of a latte and a manicure. Yes, that may be wishful marketing on Mercury's part, but in fact I have rarely driven a new car that sent such strong signals, from the moment I slid behind the wheel, about the demographic well it is intended to tap.
10/26/2005	A Bit of Flash to Put Buyers in the Mood	THE low-slung Ford GT sits in the Manhattan Automobile Company's showroom, looking as if it is ready to leap out the doors and pounce onto an unsuspecting taxicab passing by on 11th Avenue. Anyone entering the showroom -- to shop for a new red Ford or merely to buy a bagel and coffee in the dealer's cafe -- cannot help but see the sports car, which sells for a tick over $155,000. The choice of its parking spot was not by happenstance.
10/21/2005	Ford Reports a Loss and Expects 'Significant Plant Closings'	The Ford Motor Company is the latest Detroit auto giant to stall. Ford's chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., said Thursday that his company would announce a plan for its American operations in January that includes ''significant plant closings'' and job cuts.
10/20/2005	In the Hybrid's Wake, Trying to Catch Up	At the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota unveiled a futuristic car powered by a gasoline-electric engine that sounded part Jetsons, part Star Trek. With this so-called hybrid engine under the hood, the concept car was called the Prius. Fast forward to Wednesday's opening of the 2005 Motor Show. America's Big Three auto makers -- Ford Motor, General Motors and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler -- were deploying slinky models to drape themselves over concept cars running in some kind of alternative fashion: hydrogen fuel cells or gasoline-electric engines.
10/19/2005	His Family and the Family; Fords Meet at a Time Of Turmoil in Autos	William Clay Ford Jr. was recently asked if it was fair to call him, as many have, a reluctant chief executive of the Ford Motor Company. ''Not anymore,'' he said, pondering the question at a news conference last month. ''No. No. I'm not reluctant at all.
10/18/2005	G.M. AND UNION IN A DEAL TO CUT HEALTH BENEFITS	General Motors said on Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the United Automobile Workers union to cut $1 billion in annual health care benefits for more than 750,000 blue-collar workers, retirees and their families as part of an effort to climb out of a financial crisis. ''This is a very big step forward that we will build on,'' said Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. He called it ''the single biggest cost reduction that we've probably been able to announce in a single day in the history of G.M.''
10/13/2005	Oil Spreads Wealth in Russia, and Russians Are Spending It on Foreign Cars	Three years ago Hyundai Motor's sales in Russia were as modest as its cars. Who among the new class of superrich would buy a low-profile Hyundai? And who among the poor could afford one? With revenues from Russia's oil exports pulsing through the economy, Hyundai's fortunes have changed profoundly.
10/11/2005	2 Executives Quit Troubled Ford Division	In yet another sign of the continuing effort by William Clay Ford Jr. to reshape his distressed automaker, the Ford Motor Company said Monday that two high-ranking executives were stepping aside. The departures come from within the company's North American operations, where losses are deepening and company executives are looking to reorganize. The two executives who announced their resignations were Phil Martens, head of North American product development, and Matt DeMars, who oversaw North American manufacturing.
10/11/2005	For Big Three, All the Signs Are Warnings; As Delphi Goes, So Goes G.M.?	Watch out Detroit, you could be next. That is the warning for domestic automakers from Robert S. Miller Jr., the straight-talking chief executive of Delphi, who took his company, the nation's biggest maker of auto parts, into bankruptcy protection last weekend.
10/10/2005	With Delphi Filing, Tougher Times for Auto Industry Workers	When Delphi, the nation's largest auto supplier, filed for bankruptcy on Saturday, it was the latest blow to the American auto worker's gilded age. Ninety-one years ago, Henry Ford shocked corporate America by abruptly announcing that he would roughly double his workers' average wages, to $5 a day. For the first time, many Ford line workers could afford the Model T's they were assembling.
10/9/2005	A McTruck for the McMansion	TESTED: 2006 Lincoln Mark LT WHAT IS IT? A fancy four-door pickup. HOW MUCH: Base $39,555. As tested $47,110 with four-wheel drive, adjustable pedals, running boards, moonroof, chrome wheels, backup sensors and other minor options. WHAT MAKES IT RUN? 5.4-liter V-8 (300 horsepower); 4-speed automatic. WHAT WILL IT CARRY? It'll haul 1,620 pounds of hot links to the Aggies tailgater or tow an 8,900-pound camper onto Talledega's infield. HOW THIRSTY? Rated 14 m.p.g. in town and 18 on the highway with four-wheel drive. ALTERNATIVES: Cadillac Escalade EXT $54,185; GMC Sierra Denali $42,610. IF you spend nearly $50,000 for a truck, you expect the comforts of home, even if you live in a faux chateau in a gated community. My abode is more modest, yet I was instantly impressed by a similarity between Lincoln's new pickup and a small bit of my home dcor: the slab of bogus wood on the dashboard is identical to t
10/5/2005	Running on Empty	For years critics have been saying that a reliance on gas-guzzling but profitable sport-utility vehicles could not keep American car manufacturers afloat forever. On Monday, sales figures for the month of September came out, suggesting that the day of reckoning may be at hand. Large S.U.V. sales were down 43 percent last month from a year earlier. Automakers, of course, pointed a finger at Hurricane Katrina's effect on gas prices. But the explanation is really larger -- a total failure of long-term planning. Toyota's strategists and engineers had no idea what the 2005 weather would bring when they started working on a ''21st century vehicle'' in 1994. But they certainly realized that a more fuel-efficient car might be one way to succeed in a competitive market. They dedicated the resources and rolled out their first hybrid in 1997. The company spent a reported $800 million developing the Prius, ending up with roughly 650 patents on the technology. It took a little while to catch on, but Toyota nurtured and improved its product until the moment came when the new idea would finally take off. The moment has come. Prius sales were up 90 percent in September.
10/4/2005	Big S.U.V.'s Lag in Sales, Hindered By Gas Cost	The heyday of the giant sport utility vehicle keeps moving farther away as gasoline prices loom larger. In September, industrywide sales of large S.U.V.'s were down 43 percent from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. That is particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which are dependent on truck-based S.U.V.'s.
9/29/2005	Ford to Offer Fire Shields For Town Car Limousines	Ford Motor, acknowledging for a second time that fuel tanks in some of its large sedans pose an increased risk of explosion in rear-end collisions, offered Wednesday to provide protective fire shields to owners of Lincoln Town Car stretch limousines. Ford will not offer the fire shields to the millions of individual owners who drive cars with the same fuel system, saying the problem is specific to the limousines. Safety advocates have called on the automaker to recall the three million Ford vehicles that have the same fuel system, which was built into recent models of the Town Car, Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis.
9/24/2005	U.S. Orders Ford to Retest a Former Dumpsite in New Jersey	The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered the Ford Motor Company to retest a former chemical dumpsite in Ringwood, N.J., to determine how contaminated it still is, even though Ford cleaned it a decade ago and the federal agency gave it a clean bill of health at the time. Over the last 18 months, residents of the area have complained to federal, state and local agencies about numerous outcroppings of hardened blue-gray material in areas where children play and adults hunt.
9/22/2005	Ford Plans to Build a Lot More Hybrids	The Ford Motor Company plans to increase production of hybrid electric vehicles tenfold, to 250,000 vehicles annually, by the end of the decade, executives said Wednesday. By 2010, the company said that more than half of its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury models would offer the technology as an option, accounting for roughly 8 percent of the three brands' current sales.
9/14/2005	Once Home to Ford, Canadian City Is Losing Auto Work	At the foot of Drouillard Road, the main street of what was once the separate municipality of Ford City, a plaque recalls a bitter and often violent 1945 strike at the nearby Ford complex that ultimately changed labor laws and significantly increased the power of unions in Canada. This week, the Canadian Auto Workers gave tentative acceptance to a contract that will allow the Ford Motor Company of Canada to eliminate about 1,100 jobs in exchange for little more than slight improvements in severance, and minimal wage and benefit increases for the remaining employees. That says much about how the union's power has changed since then.
9/13/2005	Ford Completes Sale of Hertz to 3 Firms	The Ford Motor Company said on Monday that it had completed a deal to sell its Hertz rental car unit to a group of private investors in a $5.6 billion deal. The sale is one of the largest to a group of equity firms and allows Ford to cash in on one of its most valuable assets as it faces falling profits in its automotive operations. Ford will receive $5.6 billion in cash for Hertz, the nation's largest auto rental company. The total transaction, including debt, was valued at $15 billion.
9/12/2005	Ford Labor Deal in Canada Includes Job Cuts	The Ford Motor Company is close to reaching agreement with its Canadian union over a new labor contract that will include significant job cuts, a top labor leader said Sunday night. ''We're not going to have a rich agreement, but we're going to have a responsible agreement,'' said Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, in a teleconference from Toronto.
9/8/2005	Ford Recall Involves Millions Of Vehicles	The Ford Motor Company recalled close to four million pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles on Wednesday, saying that a leak-prone cruise control system could ignite fires. The recall, the fifth-largest by an automaker in United States history, involves some of Ford's most popular trucks and S.U.V.'s, including the nation's top-selling vehicle, the F-150 pickup. Ford Expeditions, Broncos and Lincoln Navigators are also included in the recall, which affects many models from as far back as 1994 up to 2002. Ford said owners of affected vehicles would be notified by mail immediately.
9/8/2005	Ford Said to Be Ready to Pursue a Hertz Sale	The Ford Motor Company is planning to recommend to its board today that it sell its Hertz rental car business to a group of investors led by the Carlyle Group for more than $10 billion, according to executives involved in the deal. Ford, which has been weighing a plan to spin off or sell Hertz, the world's largest rental car company, was working last night to complete final terms with the Carlyle-led group that would be presented at the board meeting today, the executives said. The bidding group also includes Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity.
9/4/2005	Driven	THE PEOPLE'S TYCOON Henry Ford and the American Century. By Steven Watts. Illustrated. 614 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
9/2/2005	Automakers, Briefly Rich in Sales, Looking at a Dry Spell	The brief sales honeymoon for the domestic automakers appears to be over. General Motors reported yesterday that sales had dropped sharply in August, and the industry reported weakness across the board in sales of the large sport utility vehicles that the domestic automakers, in particular, have depended on.
8/28/2005	IDEAS & TRENDS:  Does Lighter Equal Deadlier?	THE last time the government decided to make cars go farther on a gallon of gas, during the energy shocks of the 1970's, the strategy worked. Or at least it did for about a decade, as new regulations forced automakers to make more efficient vehicles. Soaring gas prices and shortages were also a powerful motivator for consumers to trade in their Oldsmobile Toronados for little Datsuns and Ford Escorts. Gas mileage for the average new vehicle went from 13.1 miles per gallon in 1975 models to 22.1 miles per gallon in 1987 models, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. For this latest energy shock, with its first overhaul of fuel economy standards in three decades the Bush administration is responding more cautiously, citing safety as a reason for restraint. The regulatory system adopted 30 years ago, they say, led to unnecessary deaths by forcing automakers to produce cars that were too small, light and unsafe.
8/12/2005	A Car Culture's Not-So-Complex Creator	The People's Tycoon Henry Ford and the AmericanCentury By Steven Watts Illustrated. 614 pages. Knopf. $30. In his last book, ''The Magic Kingdom,'' Steven Watts advanced a sweeping thesis and defended it boldly. Walt Disney, in his view, was more than an artistic innovator. He reshaped the national mind and helped create the American way of life. In ''The People's Tycoon,'' Mr. Watts moves on to an even more powerful culture-maker, Henry Ford.
8/2/2005	2 Carmakers Trim Prices, But Rebates May Shrink	General Motors and Ford may be slowly backing away from a longstanding Detroit practice: inflating the price tags on cars and then offering big rebates to sweeten the deal. In the latest escalation of the price war among the Big Three American automakers, G.M. and Ford said Monday that they would cut the sticker prices on a few dozen of their new cars and trucks, in some cases by thousands of dollars. That could mean smaller and fewer discounts and other incentives that consumers have grown to expect when they buy an American car.
7/24/2005	The Green Machine That Could Be Detroit	IMAGINE that you are running a domestic automaker. Rising gasoline prices threaten your lucrative S.U.V. sales, a glut of car-making capacity promises ever more competition, and burdensome union contracts limit your ability to cut costs. Then there are the Chinese. They're beginning to put together the parts they've been making for years, and sooner rather than later, whole cars from China will arrive at scarily low prices. What do you do? The easy answer is to follow the path that Detroit has taken for years. Grind out well-made but ho-hum vehicles and offer them at huge discounts. Let your debt rating fall below investment grade. And when California tries to impose mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases, you sue, even if some other states want the same stricter standards -- and even if some consumers are lining up to pay hefty premiums for energy-saving hybrid vehicles that run on both gasoline and electricity.
7/23/2005	A Wider Inquiry on Fires in Ford Trucks	As Ford Motor faces numerous lawsuits and tries to determine why hundreds of its trucks have burst into flames, federal authorities have widened their investigation into whether a faulty cruise control switch is causing the fires. The families of two people killed in fires that the families say erupted from the trucks have sued Ford, and a third family is expected to file a wrongful-death suit next week. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also stepped up pressure on Ford, expanding its investigation to include more than 3.7 million Lincoln Navigators, Ford Expeditions and F-150 pickup trucks, the nation's best-selling vehicle.
7/20/2005	Ford Motor's Earnings Decline 19% in the Quarter	The Ford Motor Company reported a 19 percent decline in second-quarter earnings on Tuesday as it continues to struggle to keep American customers. While the company's performance has shown more resilience this year than that of its crosstown rival, General Motors, some financial analysts were nonetheless concerned that Ford's second-quarter results were propped up by a tax refund and other favorable tax-related developments.
7/19/2005	Iacocca, Away From the Grind, Still Has a Lot to Say	Lee A. Iacocca is back and still shooting from the hip. After remaining silent during Detroit's recent doldrums, Mr. Iacocca, the 80-year-old former Chrysler chairman, is talking about cars again and even promoting Chrysler's cars in three new commercials. In an interview on Monday, the man who once pulled Chrysler from the brink of bankruptcy in the early 1980's offered his views on the domestic industry and its weakest giant, General Motors.
7/12/2005	With Sierra Club's Help, Ford Pushes a New Hybrid	When the Sierra Club approached the Ford Motor Company last year and offered to help promote the company's first hybrid electric vehicle, the company spurned the olive branch. The Sierra Club has long been a nemesis of Detroit automakers and a critic of Ford's chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr. But when Mr. Ford later heard of the decision, he was said to be angry that an opportunity had been missed to buff the company's image in the way that Toyota has done so deftly with its hybrids.
7/7/2005	As the Going Gets Tough, Chrysler Calls on Its Old Pitchman	Chrysler is bringing back Lee A. Iacocca to do what he does best -- pitch cars in commercials. At least that is the plan. On Wednesday, Chrysler executives said a deal was being negotiated with Mr. Iacocca, the company's 80-year-old retired chairman, adding that they hoped to have all the details worked out by Thursday. The first of an initial series of three commercials has already been shot. And yes, it will feature Mr. Iacocca's classic line from his commercials of another era -- ''If you can find a better car, buy it'' -- though it will be read by the other star of the first commercial, the actor Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame.
7/6/2005	Ford, Too, Is Offering Employees' Price to All	It is a good time to buy an American car -- or so Detroit's Big Three automakers want consumers to think. On Tuesday, General Motors announced that it would extend to Aug. 1 its highly successful sales promotion, which offers vehicles for the same price that G.M. employees pay. Several hours later, Ford Motor said it, too, would begin selling most of its vehicles at the reduced employee rate. And Chrysler, the American division of DaimlerChrysler, is expected to announce details of an employee discount program of its own on Wednesday, when its sale begins.
6/23/2005	A U.A.W. Chief Awaits a G.M. Showdown	As a negotiator, Ron Gettelfinger, the United Automobile Workers president, is known more for the carrot than the stick. Just don't mistake him for easygoing. This year, he briefly banned marines stationed near Solidarity House, the union's headquarters, from parking in the union lot if they drove foreign cars or had Bush bumper stickers. And in 2001, shortly after being nominated for the union presidency, he summed up his style in one word: ''abrasive.''
6/22/2005	Shifting Michigan Southward; Foreign Automakers, Settled in South, Set Industry's Pace	By most accounts, the United States auto industry is in deep trouble. But don't tell that to the newest workers here in Alabama, where foreign carmakers are redefining the auto industry in America. Automakers from overseas first began building manufacturing plants in this country in the 1970's, largely as a defensive response to protectionist threats. But even as General Motors and Ford have been announcing thousands of job cuts, the foreign automakers are aggressively building new factories and expanding plants they opened not long ago.
6/22/2005	Ford Plans To Cut 5% Of Salaried Work Force	The Ford Motor Company said Tuesday that it would cut 5 percent, or about 1,700, of its white-collar jobs in North America. It also said it would no longer give bonuses to managers or make matching contributions to the 401(k) plans of salaried employees. Ford also lowered its yearly earnings forecast to $1 to $1.25 a share, compared with a previous forecast of $1.25 to $1.50 a share, saying it expected sluggish vehicle sales to continue. It was the second time in two and a half months that Ford cut its earnings projections for the year.
6/14/2005	Hertz Is Planning A Public Offering	The Hertz rental car unit of the Ford Motor Company plans an initial public offering of stock, as Ford moves ahead with efforts announced in April to raise money various ways. Hertz disclosed the plan in a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
6/13/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; Harvest Season for the '08 Car Colors	FLORIDA is famous for alligator farms and nutria farms and the farms that produce flavorless winter strawberries. To the auto industry, however, Florida is famous for its panel farms. These are the fields where the durability of new automobile paints is tested, determining if the finishes can withstand years of exposure under the state's harsh combination of sun, salt and humidity.
6/12/2005	High-Yield Market Survives G.M. and Ford, but Now What?	THE high-yield bond market has coped surprisingly well with the downgrading last month of General Motors and Ford Motor bonds to junk status. But a caution flag is waving at anyone who is now tempted to jump into the high-yield market.
6/5/2005	The Rough Road Ahead For G.M. and Ford	THE American automotive industry is facing its darkest hours in decades, says Dietmar A. Ostermann, vice president and auto industry specialist at the consulting firm A.T. Kearney and a former BMW engineer. Huge layoffs, he says, are the only solution. Here are excerpts from a conversation: Q. How serious is the situation that General Motors and Ford are facing? A. It's the worst it has been in the 20 years that I've been associated with the automotive industry. Q. What is at the root of the problem? A. Consumer demands are shifting. General Motors and Ford have not been at the forefront of those demand shifts. Quality is a very significant issue, whether perceived or real. Companies such as Toyota have been given a lot of credit on that score. There's a lot of volume shift away from Ford and G.M. toward Toyota, Honda and Nissan. This trend will continue.
6/3/2005	A Club for Every Car, Even the Pinto	THE annual migration of Pontiac Aztek owners to Cedar Point, Ohio, may not be in the same league as, say the movement of the humpback whale from Alaska to its Hawaiian breeding grounds, but they do have something in common: a need for companionship made more intense when the species is endangered. Automotive gatherings normally celebrate the rare classics, like the million-dollar Duesenbergs, Auburns and Hispano Suizas at the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach, Calif. Others attract more contemporary objects d'art--like the American muscle cars at the Woodward Dream Cruise in Detroit. But what could draw the 300 Volkswagen New Beetle owners who for the last five years have descended each spring on Roswell, N.M.?
6/2/2005	Sales Off Again at Ford and G.M; 2 Foreign Rivals Up	Even though General Motors and Ford Motor continued to have difficulty selling cars, they did narrow their losses last month. Toyota and Nissan, meanwhile, continued to post healthy sales gains. For the industry, sales of cars and trucks in the United States were down slightly, to about 1.5 million vehicles. According to Wards AutoInfo Bank, Americans bought 0.3 percent fewer vehicles than they did last May.
5/26/2005	Much of Visteon Comes Spinning Back to Ford	The Ford Motor Company said Wednesday that it would bail out Visteon, its ailing former parts division, and reclaim 24 of Visteon's plants and offices in the United States and Mexico. The deal will cost Ford as much as $1.15 billion over the next four years in special charges and up to $425 million in operating losses over this year and next year.
5/20/2005	Third Agency Cuts Credit Rating Of Ford Motor, but Not to Junk	The Ford Motor Company's bruised credit rating suffered another blow on Thursday as Fitch downgraded the automaker's debt but left it out of junk bond territory. For now, Ford's investment-grade rating at Fitch appears to be safe. In its announcement on Thursday, Fitch said it was not likely to cut Ford to junk status before the end of the year. Nonetheless, the news was another blow to a company that has been downgraded this month by all three major credit ratings agencies.
5/19/2005	Lexus Tops Owner Survey For 5th Year	Lexus drivers reported the fewest problems with their new vehicles, while owners of cars like Volvos, Porsches and Saabs on average had much more to complain about, according to the latest survey from J.D. Power & Associates. The study also found that owners were significantly more impressed with their Nissans and Hummers after giving the brands dismal ratings in last year's survey. Lexus, which is owned by Toyota, led the J.D. Power study for the fifth year in a row. Lexus was followed by Jaguar, owned by Ford, and BMW, which took the third spot. The worst performers in the study were Land Rover and Mazda, both owned by Ford, and Suzuki.
5/15/2005	Purebred Looks, Meow Mix Parts	TESTED: Jaguar X-Type Sportwagon WHAT IS IT? Compact five-seat station wagon with all-wheel drive. HOW MUCH? $36,330 base; $38,020 as tested with stability control and braking assist ($525), heated front seats ($500) and destination charge ($665). WHAT'S UNDER THE BONNET? 3-liter V-6 (227 horsepower); 5-speed automatic. HOW THIRSTY? E.P.A. rating is 18 m.p.g. city, 24 highway. Observed mileage, 21 m.p.g. Premium fuel recommended. ALTERNATIVES: BMW 325xi Sports Wagon $33,645; Audi A4 Avant 2.0T, $29,150; Mercedes-Benz C240 4Matic wagon $35,350; Volvo V50 T5 AWD, $30,080. AFTER a week in Jaguar's first station wagon, I am still unsure why the British luxury car maker felt it suddenly had to offer one. The company line is that Audi, BMW and Mercedes all have wagons, so why not us?
5/14/2005	Not the Top of the Safety Priorities; Documents Show Ford and Volvo at Odds Over Roof Strength	Volvo has promoted the sturdiness of its cars' roofs since it ran advertisements in the 1970's showing seven Volvo sedans stacked up, asking, ''Are you in the market for a hardtop?'' And Volvo, in introducing its first sport utility vehicle in 2002, the XC90, had a promotional video claiming the strength of the roof ''exceeds the legal requirements in the U.S.A. by more than 100 percent.''
5/13/2005	Ford's Wounded Credit Rating Suffers Another Heavy Blow	One week after the Ford Motor Company lost its investment-grade rating from Standard & Poor's, a second credit rating agency on Thursday also lowered its assessment of the automaker's debt, but to one step above junk status. Also on Thursday, Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., told company shareholders at their annual meeting that he would not accept any compensation from the company until profits from the automotive division improved.
5/13/2005	Always Low Wages. Always	Last week Standard and Poor's, a bond rating agency, downgraded both Ford and General Motors bonds to junk status. That is, it sees a significant risk that the companies won't be able to pay their debts.
5/6/2005	A Big Splash, Ripples to Follow; G.M. and Ford Debt Ratings Downgraded Sooner Than Expected	Many investors knew it was coming, but they did not expect that two of the nation's biggest issuers of bonds would be reduced to junk status so soon. As a result, Standard & Poor's announcement at midday yesterday that it was cutting its credit ratings for both General Motors and the Ford Motor Company set off a selling spree in the corporate bond market. The rating cut to below investment grade begins a process of adjustment that could ripple through, and roil, the fixed-income markets for weeks.
5/6/2005	CREDIT RANKINGS OF G.M. AND FORD ARE CUT TO JUNK	General Motors and Ford Motor lost their investment grade ratings Thursday, pushing two of corporate America's biggest borrowers into the ranks of junk bonds and rattling the financial markets with the message that the collective fortunes of the remaining two domestically owned automakers have sunk to their lowest points yet. The downgrading by Standard & Poor's, the credit agency, reflects the inability of G.M. and Ford to make enough cars that people will buy without $5,000 rebates and other sales incentives, as well as worries that the two automakers may not emerge anytime soon from their troubles, starting with eroding earnings and sliding sales.
5/4/2005	Ford and G.M. Suffer as Buyers Shun S.U.V.'s	The latest automobile sales figures show that Americans are increasingly wary of gas-thirsty sport utility vehicles. That was particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which both saw their sales slip last month as consumers continued their steady march into Asian car companies' dealerships. Both Toyota and Nissan posted record sales gains in April, which helped push overall auto sales in North America up 1.8 percent.
5/3/2005	FORMER CHRYSLER DESIGNER TO BE A FORD DESIGN DIRECTOR	The Ford Motor Company hired a former DaimlerChrysler designer, Freeman Thomas. Mr. Thomas, 47, will join Ford effective June 1 as director of strategic design, a spokeswoman, Jennifer Flake, said. Mr. Thomas, who helped develop the New Beetle for Volkswagen in the 1990's, resigned April 21 from the California studio of Chrysler after six years with the company. Ford said he was on the team that designed Chrysler's popular 300 sedan.
5/2/2005	Out of the Garage and Into the Streets: A Season to Celebrate Cars	WHEN the tulips and azaleas start to stir, so do the collectors. Vintage cars and motorcycles are dusted off and tuned up as owners' thoughts turn to the coming months of shows and race meets. The range of events is broad, from rarefied concours d'lgance that draw hugely expensive, professionally restored classics -- by invitation only, of course -- to down-to-earth local shows that attract postwar American cars and trucks displayed by proud owners.
4/26/2005	Alexander J. Trotman, 71, Former Chief of Ford Motor	Alexander J. Trotman, who rose from a student trainee at Ford Motor to become the company's chief executive for much of the 1990's, died on Monday in Yorkshire, England. He was 71. Ford said in a statement that Mr. Trotman had died after a brief illness.
4/25/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; Carmakers Hug Their Long-Gone Children	SOME of the best public relations a car company can hope for comes not from employees or even new customers, but from owners of its vintage automobiles -- the men and women who turn a casual Sunday cruise into a parade, who field questions from curious passers-by, who run the countless car clubs, newsletters and Web sites devoted to particular marques. While the relationship has not always been reciprocal, carmakers are increasingly interested in helping collectors answer questions, solve problems and track down hard-to-find parts. Companies supply classic cars for display at shows, provide liaisons to speak to owners' clubs and open factory doors for special tours.
4/23/2005	Bicoastal Blues For G.M. and Ford	Setting aside its home base in the Upper Midwest, Detroit has a blue state problem -- and it is about to get worse. Washington and Oregon plan to become the 9th and 10th states to adopt California's tough car emissions rules, forming an increasingly potent market for more fuel-efficient vehicles on the West Coast and in the Northeast.
4/21/2005	Gas Prices and Poor Sales Push Down Ford's Profit	Citing rising gasoline prices and falling sales, the Ford Motor Company said on Wednesday that its first-quarter profit fell 38 percent, to $1.2 billion. Ford said it would break even at best in the second quarter, and cut production of cars and trucks by 5 percent in Europe and North America. Executives also said the company was considering selling its Hertz rental car division, or other alternatives related to the business, to shore up its cash reserves.
4/18/2005	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; Another Roadside Attraction	FOR years, I kept an eye out in my travels for a hubcap to go on the left rear wheel of my 1987 Ford Econoline van. None of the seedy roadside hubcap hawkers I drove past seemed to have one. I searched highway medians from time to time, though without much hope of success. So imagine my surprise one day, on the way home from the market, to find an exact match, right along the road! I pounded it into place and drove happily on.
4/18/2005	AS STOCKS SLIDE, INVESTORS FOCUS ON EARNINGS DATA	After last week's market plunge -- when America's three main stock gauges fell more than 3 percent -- Wall Street and unusually nervous individual investors are looking to the flood of earnings reports this week to see how optimistic corporate America is in its outlook for the economy. Almost a third of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and almost half the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average are to report earnings for the first three months of the year. But more importantly, many of them will comment on the financial quarters ahead and could either counter or reinforce the current pessimism about the economy.
4/15/2005	G.M. and Ford Stuck in Reverse As Buyers Look Beyond Detroit	In just the last few weeks, the grand plans that were supposed to carry General Motors and Ford Motor into their second centuries have crumbled. Sales at G.M. have fallen, profits have tumbled to losses. Last week, Ford also warned of a drop in earnings. Thursday, in yet another blow, its union refused to give much ground on G.M.'s health care coverage. If that were not enough, G.M.'s stock hit a 12-year low. [Page C1.]
4/12/2005	Ford Shares Fall Steeply After Forecast	Shares of Ford Motor fell to their lowest point in more than a year and a half on Monday after its surprise announcement on Friday that it was cutting its yearly earnings forecast in half. Ford's news on Friday affirmed what many industry analysts had suspected: the financial problems facing General Motors, the world's largest automaker, are not G.M.-specific and are a sign of the larger problems that American automakers face in competing with their Asian rivals. The announcement also raises questions about how candid Ford was when it provided its financial guidance at the start of the year.
4/9/2005	Ford Lowers Its Earnings Forecast for Year	The Ford Motor Company lowered its earnings forecast for the year on Friday, citing higher gas prices and rising health care costs. The company said it would also abandon its goal of $7 billion in pretax profit by 2006, a cornerstone of the turnaround plan that its chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., put in place after he took control in 2001. Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker, now expects to earn $1.25 to $1.50 a share for the year, down from its previous guidance of $1.75 to $1.90 a share.
4/6/2005	MOODY'S DROPS G.M.'S DEBT RATING TO JUST ABOVE JUNK	Moody's Investors Service downgraded its rating of General Motors' debt to Baa3, its lowest investment grade rating, and put the Ford Motor Company under review for a possible downgrade. Moody's now has Ford's debt rated Baa1, two grades above the new G.M. rating. Moody's also put G.M. on a negative outlook, suggesting a further downgrade to a junk bond rating is possible. The move brought Moody's rating of G.M.'s debt in line with the ratings of the other two major ratings firms, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. The downgrade was prompted by G.M.'s announcement last month that it was scaling back its projections for earnings and cash flow for this year. Danny Hakim (NYT)
4/5/2005	FORD MOTOR TO CUT 1,000 WHITE-COLLAR JOBS	In a further sign of the struggles of domestic automakers, the Ford Motor Company plans to cut 1,000 white-collar jobs in the United States in the face of falling sales and increased competition. Greg Smith, president of Ford's operations in North and South America, revealed the plan in an e-mail sent to company employees on Monday. Ford plans to make the cuts this month, mostly through buyout packages offered to some of its salaried workforce, a company spokesperson said. Ford's share of the United States market fell to 19.5 percent in the first quarter, down from 20.4 percent a year earlier, according to AutoData. Danny Hakim (NYT)
4/2/2005	U.S. Automakers Lose Ground to Rivals	Auto sales perked up in March, though domestic carmakers continued to lose ground to foreign competitors. Sales at General Motors fell 1.5 percent and were down 4.9 percent at Ford Motor from the month a year earlier, while Nissan Motor reported a 12.6 percent increase, the first time the company had sold more than 100,000 cars and trucks in the United States in a month.
3/31/2005	Lawsuit Documents and a Study Raise Questions on the Safety of Ford Explorer Roofs	A new study and documents from a recent lawsuit against the Ford Motor Company raise fresh questions about the safety of roofs on Ford Explorers. The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen released a study on Wednesday that accuses Ford of ignoring evidence that stronger roofs would lead to fewer injuries.
3/27/2005	The Nation; Detroit's New Crisis Could Be Its Worst	BIG SLICE has a prescription for the ills facing Detroit's automakers. ''They need to step their game up and put their ear to the streets,'' said the bear-sized 32-year-old who lives outside Los Angeles and customizes cars and buses for the rapper and trendsetter Snoop Dogg that include a purple and gold 1967 Pontiac Parisienne signed by several Los Angeles Lakers. ''Go put your ear to the street and ask people what they want instead of trying to force something on people,'' he said. ''They're making ugly cars.''
3/24/2005	Unit of Euro RSCG Gets Jaguar Account	The struggling Jaguar Cars division of Ford Motor yesterday named the London and New York offices of Euro RSCG/Fuel, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas, the global creative agency of record on its account. Billings on the assignment, which had been handled for four years by the Irvine, Calif., and London offices of Young & Rubicam, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands division of the WPP Group, were estimated at more than $100 million.
3/24/2005	2 Automakers Reach Deals On Installing Satellite Radio	XM Satellite Radio Holdings said yesterday that its radios would be installed in cars made by the Hyundai Motor Company for sale in the United States, while Sirius Satellite Radio said receivers for its service would be included as options on some Range Rovers and Jaguars, made by Ford Motor. XM Radio said Hyundai Motor America would be the first automaker to install its radios as standard equipment. Sirius said its receivers would be offered as factory-installed options beginning in May on some Jaguar models and beginning in July on some Range Rovers.
3/22/2005	Big Three Workers Give an Inch on Health Care	Like other Big Three auto workers, Deborah Stewart has medical coverage that is, if not a free lunch, then close to it. No deductibles. No monthly premiums. But Ms. Stewart, who works at a sprawling General Motors complex in the shadows of the Detroit skyline, says she believes it cannot last. ''They're losing money, saying they've got to make changes, and I think everybody expects that it's going to come,'' said Ms. Stewart, 55, referring to cuts in health care benefits. A 30-year G.M. veteran who oversees robots that attach fenders to cars, she was heading out after her shift Monday at the Detroit/Hamtramck assembly plant, which produces cars like the Buick LeSabre. ''I think it will come,'' she said, ''without a doubt.''
3/22/2005	A New Automaker Mantra: Emissions? What Emissions?	Several automakers, among them Toyota, Ford Motor and BMW, are financing an advertising campaign aimed at politicians that asserts that automobiles are ''virtually emission-free.'' The campaign is part of an effort by a broad coalition of automakers to present their vehicles as environmentally benign at a time when the coalition is suing California to block a new regulation to curb global warming emissions and is continuing to lobby in Washington against tougher fuel economy regulations.
3/19/2005	FORD ORDERED TO PAY $10.2 MILLION FOR EXPLORER ROLLOVER	A Florida jury yesterday ordered the Ford Motor Company to pay $10.2 million to the family of a 26-year-old woman who was killed when her 2000 Ford Explorer flipped over after being forced off the road, a lawyer for the family said. The state court jury in Jacksonville, Fla., issued the verdict, said Steve Pajcic, a lawyer for the family of Claire Duncan. The family argued that the Explorer's roof was crushed during the rollover, causing the seat belt to spool out and her head to hit the roof. The jury's verdict is the fourth against Ford in an Explorer rollover lawsuit. Ford faces more than two dozen trials this year over Explorer rollover lawsuits, according to lawyers suing Ford.
3/17/2005	JUDGE RULES AGAINST FORD IN DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT	A federal judge in Tennessee ruled that Ford's Primus lending unit discriminated against African-American buyers by allowing dealers to mark up interest rates. Judge Aleta Trauger said she would issue an order stopping the practice unless Primus reached a settlement by April 18, said Michael Terry, an attorney for customers. The buyers claimed that dealers charged black customers an average of $450 a car more through higher interest rates. Seven cases, including lawsuits against the lending arms of General Motors and Nissan, have settled by agreeing to change policies, Mr. Terry said.
3/11/2005	FORD TO GIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO VISTEON	The Ford Motor Company agreed to provide some assistance to the Visteon Corporation, its biggest supplier and a former subsidiary, while continuing to negotiate broader changes in their spinoff agreement made in 2000, Ford said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Ford has about 17,700 employees at Visteon plants, and Visteon reimburses Ford for those costs. Ford said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had agreed to reduce those payments by $25 million a month at least through the end of 2005. Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., will also buy about $150 million worth of equipment for Visteon to make parts for Ford, the filing said. Ford will pay Visteon faster for parts, too. Visteon's chief executive, Michael F. Johnson, said in a statement that the agreement ''will improve Visteon's operating results and cash flow.'' Visteon, based in Van Buren Township, Mich., makes auto electronics, interiors, steering parts and chassis components.
3/6/2005	How Green Was My Vehicle Fleet	JOINING the trend to environmentally friendly cars, the Town of North Hempstead has added 7 hybrid sport utility vehicles to its fleet of 48 traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The seven are 2005 Ford Escape Hybrids, compact S.U.V.'s powered by a 94-horsepower electric motor and a 133-horsepower four-cylinder gasoline engine. The Escape automatically switches between the two and is capable of running on the electric motor at low speeds, the gas engine at higher speeds or a combination of both.
3/3/2005	Taking Down the 'No Foreign Cars' Signs in Michigan	At many union halls in Michigan, signs on parking lots still warn that foreign-made cars ''will be towed away at owner's expense.'' So why is Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, pushing so hard to close a sweetheart land deal with Toyota Motor?
3/2/2005	G.M. and Ford Lose Ground In Sales Again	The gears of the domestic auto industry are grinding again, with shares of General Motors and the Ford Motor Company trading near one-year lows and the companies continuing to lose customers. Sales at G.M. fell 12.6 percent in February from the same month a year earlier, according to monthly sales reports released by automakers on Tuesday; Ford's sales fell 2.8 percent. Both companies scaled back the numbers of cars and trucks they planned to make as unsold models accumulate on dealer lots, though G.M.'s cut were deeper and it is showing few signs of a turnaround.
3/1/2005	Ford's Lending Practices Challenged in a Lawsuit	Ford Motor Credit, the division of Ford Motor Company that makes car loans, is being taken to court in a class-action suit contending that the company's lending practices allow dealers to discriminate against minorities. In the first trial over discriminatory practices in auto lending, a federal judge in Nashville will begin hearing a case on Tuesday that accuses Ford dealers of discriminating against minorities by tacking on additional percentage points that raise the overall interest rate on their loans.
2/22/2005	Building Autos With the Same DNA; Saab's New S.U.V. Has a Lot in Common With Buick, GMC and Isuzu	Is the 9-7X the first sport utility vehicle from Saab, or is it a Chevy TrailBlazer dressed up to look Swedish? The 9-7X, which is to come out this spring, will be roughly the same size and shape as a TrailBlazer, and for that matter, a GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier and Isuzu Ascender. It will roll off the same production line as the TrailBlazer, Envoy, Rainier and Ascender at a General Motors plant in Moraine, Ohio. All five S.U.V.'s share a pickup truck frame, the same engines, a similar sheet-metal design and many of the same parts, but the Saab has a base price of $38,270, about $11,000 higher than the TrailBlazer.
2/13/2005	Ford Enters the Crossover Bake-Off	LIKE researchers testing new compounds in a laboratory, or cooks whipping up recipes for a prize competition, auto designers are trying to find the perfect formula for the industry's hottest new thing, the Frankenwagon known as the crossover. Crossovers have traits of two or more types of vehicles, but in most cases they cannot be tidily categorized. Some are built on the chassis of a car and have the body style of a sport utility, like the Toyota Highlander or Honda Pilot; with others, like the Buick Rendezvous, a sport utility body rides on a minivan base. So the automakers' product planners are forever tinkering with the ingredients, varying the proportions of car, sport utility and even pickup to develop the perfect mix.
2/8/2005	Big Pickup Trucks Eclipsing S.U.V.'s; 'It's a Guy Thing. It's Like N.F.L. Football.' (Gas Mileage an Afterthought)	The big sport utility vehicle is in a slump. But the big pickup truck? It's going full tilt. S.U.V. sales continued to grow last year as buyers sought smaller-size models. But sales of larger S.U.V.'s like the Ford Explorer, Hummer H2 and Chevy Suburban appear to have reached a plateau.
2/4/2005	Mustang Ad to Replace Ad Withdrawn by Ford	The Ford Motor Company will replace a commercial for a new Lincoln pickup that it withdrew from Super Bowl XXXIX with a spot for the Ford Mustang. The Lincoln spot, for the 2006 Mark LT pickup, was withdrawn by Ford on Wednesday after a group representing people abused by Catholic priests condemned it as insensitive.
2/3/2005	Ad Reaction Claims Super Bowl Casualty	Even before kickoff, the Super Bowl has its first advertising casualty. In a highly unusual last-minute reversal, the Ford Motor Company withdrew a commercial from the game late yesterday in the face of complaints.
2/2/2005	A message to the young: The S.U.V. is a big, hairy beast to drive.	SPORT utility vehicles are beastly, or at least beastlike. That is the message of a new public service campaign from the governments of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The $27 million campaign, paid for with settlement money from a lawsuit against the Ford Motor Company, starts this week and is aimed at informing young men in particular about the rollover risks of sport utility vehicles.
2/2/2005	In a Tough Month for Autos, Ford Takes the Biggest Fall	Month after month, Detroit continues to lose American customers to Asian competitors. Last month, it was the Ford Motor Company that lost the most, with sales falling 4.9 percent in January compared with the same month a year earlier, Ward's AutoInfoBank reported Tuesday. And financial analysts are beginning to worry about the sales pace of some of Ford's new products.
1/31/2005	Ford to Use an E.P.A. Engine In Effort to Develop Diesel Cars	The Environmental Protection Agency has developed a prototype diesel engine that meets tough new emissions standards to be phased in over the next few years in the United States. On Friday, the Ford Motor Company said the technology was promising enough that it had reached agreement with the agency to try to develop it for use in its cars and trucks. At a news conference at an E.P.A. research installation here, Gerhard Schmidt, Ford's vice president for research and advanced engineering, said, ''We don't want to give the impression today that everything's solved and next year you will see several hundred thousand light-duty diesel vehicles on the road, but this is already a great start and has great promise.''
1/26/2005	Ford Says '05 Earnings Will Fall, but It Still Expects to Make Money Making Cars	The Ford Motor Company said on Tuesday that it expected operating earnings to fall as much as 14 percent this year as record profits at its lending division are weighed down by rising interest rates. Ford also expects a weak first quarter that will be far short of Wall Street's expectations. But executives are forecasting sharply higher profits for the core business of manufacturing and selling cars and trucks. And they said they still expected pretax profit of $7 billion in 2006, the central goal of a turnaround plan put in place after steep losses and a management shakeup in 2001.
1/21/2005	Ford Posts Profit as Finance Unit Offsets Auto Losses	The Ford Motor Company said Thursday that it posted a modest profit in the fourth quarter, as gains at its financing unit offset losses in its automotive division. Profit at Ford's core business of selling cars and trucks continued to lag, particularly in North America, where it has been steadily losing market share for a decade.

1/12/2005	Trying to Bring Back Head-Turners at Ford	Peter Horbury changed the shape of Volvos from boxes to curves. Now the Ford Motor Company is giving Mr. Horbury, a 54-year-old British designer, a much larger makeover project: get Americans excited about Fords, Lincolns and Mercurys. A year ago, Ford said that 2004 would be the year of the car and that it would boldly redesign its passenger lineup. General Motors also said it was rededicated to design. But after a year in which the Big Three's share of the domestic market fell below 60 percent for the first time despite heavy spending on rebates and financing offers, it is clear that Detroit has a way to go.
1/9/2005	Maybe the Way to Move People Is to Take Them on Vacation	ONE'S home may be one's castle, but the car ranks right up there. No wonder designers for Land Rover regularly compare the raised battlements of the Range Rover's fenders to the walls of a medieval fortress. Less commanding vehicles can represent less grand or formal domiciles. For the Ford Fairlane, a design study to be unveiled today at the Detroit auto show, the theme is ''car as beach house.''
1/5/2005	3 Japanese Carmakers Gain Against Big 3 in the U.S.	For Japanese automakers, last year brought feast or famine in the United States. Toyota, Honda and Nissan's American sales continued to surge in December, according to figures released Tuesday by the automakers, as the companies made further inroads against the Big Three domestic manufacturers, particularly General Motors and Ford Motor.
1/4/2005	India's Boom Spreads to Smaller Cities	When the first Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet opened in India, in the technology hub of Bangalore in 1995, the welcoming committee was largely absent. It was just four years after India opened its economy to outsiders, and the outlet quickly became a target of irate farmers, Hindu nationalists and others decrying what they saw as the encroachment of the corrupt, and corruptive, West. KFC's parent, Yum Brands, now has 100 KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in India, 30 opened in 2004, and a goal of 1,000 by 2014. To realize such growth, the chains have begun a seemingly inexorable march into the country's smaller boomtowns, cities like Coimbatore and Cochin in the south, and Jaipur and Meerut in the north, where middle-class Indians -- who increasingly crave localized Western foods, regional flavors and ingredients infused into the pizza, pasta or poultry -- have hailed their arrival.
1/1/2005	Toxic Waste Taints a Jewel of New Jersey's Parks System	Ringwood State Park attracted more than half a million visitors in 2003, making it one of New Jersey's most popular state parks. Located in the Highlands region near the New York border, the park has rugged trails for mountain biking and hiking, two sprawling historic manor houses, and the 96-acre New Jersey Botanical Garden. It also has a toxic waste dump that seems to defy cleanup.
12/30/2004	Mercury, a division of Ford Motor, tries an online campaign in an effort to create a cooler image.	A PROMINENT lineup of advertising and marketing talent has been assembled to produce an innovative online campaign aimed at cultivating a cooler image for a venerable brand. The brand is Mercury, the Ford Motor Company marque intended to offer buyers a choice somewhere between the bread-and-butter Ford division and the luxury line sold under the Lincoln name. For years, Mercury has been avoided by younger shoppers, put off by its reputation for stolid, stodgy products, as typified by the living room on wheels known as the Grand Marquis sedan.
12/28/2004	Once a Backwater, Slovakia Surges	Declan Cantwell is gung ho about Slovakia. A director at OneEU, a payroll company based in Dublin, he set up a branch here this fall and expects to grow from 2 employees to 40 within three years as Slovakia's economy surges. ''This is going to be an exciting place to be for the next two, three, five years, and beyond,'' he said over coffee on a recent weekday morning. ''When I take a step back, this place looks a lot like Ireland 20 years ago. If it stays on course, there's no reason it can't be every bit as successful.''
12/26/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Ford Mustang; The Pony Express Rides Again	THE last time Ford introduced a truly new Mustang, Gloria Gaynor's ''I Will Survive'' topped the pop charts, Don Baylor was the American League's most valuable player and fundamentalist Muslims were denouncing America -- under President Jimmy Carter -- as the Great Satan. Well, some things never change.
12/23/2004	FORD EARNINGS TO BE REDUCED BY DEALERSHIP SALES	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that its pretax earnings in the current quarter would be reduced by $65 million to $85 million because of costs to sell its interest in dealerships in Asia and Africa. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ford said the costs related to write-downs in the value of good will, or the difference between the prices paid for the dealerships and their market value. A spokeswoman, Marcey Evans, said the move was ''in line with our plan to divest noncore businesses.'' Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., determined the costs for selling the dealerships on Monday, according to the filing.
12/21/2004	Sponsors, But Not Just For Legislation	THE flimsy walls protecting us against unwanted advertising keep crumbling, as Arthur Ginsburg discovered recently when he received the New York State registration renewal for his Toyota Camry. With the registration card came an advertisement for Ford Motor Company, specifically a vehicle called the Freestyle -- ''the perfect bridge between car and S.U.V.,'' in case you were curious. Mr. Ginsburg also learned that by test-driving any new Ford car, he could get a $50 gift card.
12/20/2004	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Technology; To Test Snow Tires, What Could Top Florida in July?	IN this part of Florida, you need to keep a parka handy. Over the course of a day the temperature can plummet from a sweaty 85 degrees down to a frigid 50 below zero, and a blizzard can sweep through any day, all year round. This meteorological paradox is the McKinley Climatic Laboratory, located at Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach in the Florida Panhandle.
12/18/2004	World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Fuel-Cell Investment	Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler will invest 55 million Canadian dollars ($44.6 million) in a fuel-cell maker, Ballard Power Systems, as the automakers rework their alliance to speed development of the alternative-energy devices. Ford will buy 2.03 million shares at 12.34 Canadian dollars a share, for a total of 25 million Canadian dollars, while DaimlerChrysler will buy 2.43 million shares at the same price, for 30 million Canadian dollars, Ballard said. Ford and Chrysler agreed to buy the shares last December, when Ballard's stock price was above $15 a share. Ballard, of Burnaby, British Columbia, reached an agreement with the automakers in July that if it did not exercise the investment by the end of the year, the price of the shares would be reset to the market price. Ballard's stock price rose 71 Canadian cents yesterday, closing at 8.35 Canadian dollars a share.
12/13/2004	Stephen A. Girard Jr., 91, Helped Introduce Jeep to Civilian Drivers	Stephen A. Girard Jr., an industrialist and automaker who helped introduce the Jeep, formerly a generic military transport, to civilians around the world, died on Nov. 27 in Napa, Calif. He was 91 and lived in Napa. His death was confirmed by his family.
12/10/2004	Turnaround Progress Seen, 2 Executives to Leave Ford	Two of the Ford Motor Company's most senior executives retired on Thursday in a sign that the company's deep financial crisis has abated, though serious challenges remain. Both men were succeeded by close colleagues in moves that had been rumored for some time. Almost three years ago, Ford's chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., turned to a small group of longtime managers to resuscitate the company after posting a $5.5 billion loss in 2001. One of those executives, Sir Nicholas V. Scheele, 60, the president, will retire on Feb. 1. He will be succeeded by a close friend, James J. Padilla, 58, who is chief operating officer. Mr. Padilla will have both titles.
12/8/2004	Automakers Sue to Block Emissions Law In California	Toyota, General Motors and seven other automakers filed suit on Tuesday to block California's new greenhouse gas regulation, which was approved by the state in its final form in September. The suit sets up a battle between automakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. Although Mr. Schwarzenegger is a fan of the Hummer, an S.U.V. with prodigious greenhouse gas emissions, he has promised nonetheless to defend the regulation, which was signed by his Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis.
12/2/2004	Ford and G.M. Sales Slide Despite Generous Rebates	Despite a crop of new car models and a still-generous supply of rebates, sales fell for the Ford Motor Company and General Motors in November. Both companies said they would cut production in the first quarter of 2005 from levels of the same quarter this year, the latest troubling sign for job growth in Michigan and other states where the companies operate. G.M. said Tuesday that it was accelerating a plan to stop production at a plant in Linden, N.J., and would lay off nearly 1,000 workers at the plant early next year.
11/27/2004	This Year, Ontario May Pass Michigan In Making Vehicles	Michigan has been the heart of the auto industry since Henry Ford started mass-producing the Model T a century ago, but the Midwestern state is poised to be surpassed by Ontario. The Canadian province is on course to pass Michigan this year and become the biggest auto-producing state or province in North America, according to Ward's Automotive, which tracks auto production data.
11/26/2004	A 60's Star Is Reborn	ON a hot summer day more than three years ago, my wife and I were driving west on Route 78 in New Jersey when in the rearview mirror of our black 1964 Lincoln Continental I saw a motorcycle speeding up behind me. The motorcycle raced past us in the fast lane, then slowed and pulled up next to the Lincoln. The big man at the controls of the bike smiled and nodded his approval, mouthing ''nice car'' before hitting the throttle. As it turned out, the biker was headed to the same party we were. We approached him as he stood by the table full of hamburgers, hot dogs and grilled corn. ''Cowboy Curtis,'' I said, extending my hand, ''I thought that was you on the motorcycle.''
11/22/2004	Ford Engineer Is Promoted	The Ford Motor Company promoted the top engineer of the redesigned Mustang, Hau Thai-Tang, to direct future product development at the company. The promotion was the latest step by Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., to revive the company's lineup with attention-grabbing vehicles. The Mustang has been praised in early reviews. Mr. Thai-Tang, 38, succeeds Chris Theodore, 54, the company's vice president of advanced product creation, who the company said would retire.
11/16/2004	FORD SELLING FORMULA ONE RACING TEAM TO RED BULL	Red Bull, a closely held Austrian drinks maker, agreed to buy the Ford Motor Company's unprofitable Jaguar Formula One team to expand in the car racing business. Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., put Jaguar Racing up for sale to cut costs after five winless seasons. Ford absorbed $300 million in expenses in the third quarter to write down the team's assets and good will. Terms of the sale were not released. The acquisition is the biggest in motor sports by Red Bull, which makes energy drinks and sponsors European and United States teams. Ford also said yesterday that it had sold its Cosworth Racing unit, the maker of race engines, to two United States entrepreneurs.
11/14/2004	The Mouse That Plans to Roar	TWO of the three renowned British subsidiaries of the Ford Motor Company are in trouble. Land Rover has suffered from quality problems and low productivity. Jaguar is plagued by lackluster sales, more capacity to build cars than customers to buy them, and a disappointing downscale model, the X-Type. Ford's operations here are not wholly gloomy, though. Barely noticed, the Aston Martin sports car business has undergone a revolution, with new models and a showplace factory in which to build them. The boutique operation has laid plans to triple its sales and build a global dealer network.
11/14/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Aston Martin DB9; Under the Beauty, an Up-to-Date Beast	TO the short list of the year's most exclusive works of kinetic art Bentley Continental GT, Ford GT, Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Porsche Carrera GT -- you can add a new and remarkable bit of sculpture, the Aston Martin DB9. Automotive fashionistas, including those who rarely give obscure Aston Martin a second thought, are going to find its latest car hard to resist. Even in Britain, where the sight of an Aston Martin is perhaps a bit more common than in the United States, pedestrians stop in their tracks and stare. Other drivers' eyeballs lock on the DB9 and swivel as it passes. Young men -- and the not so young -- want their pictures taken next to it. The car generates grins and thumbs-up signs wherever it goes.
11/12/2004	More G.M. and Ford S.U.V.'s To Get Anti-Rollover Systems	General Motors and the Ford Motor Company said on Thursday that they would significantly expand the use of technologies aimed at reducing the risk of rollovers in their sport utility vehicles. G.M. said it would offer electronic stability control systems, which apply brake pressure to help a driver maintain control, on most of its S.U.V.'s over the next year. The company said that in December it would begin making stability control a standard feature on most of the large 2005 S.U.V.'s that do not already have it, including the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon. Next year, it will add the midsize S.U.V.'s, including the Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy and the Hummer H3.
11/12/2004	Mustang Fever, All Over Again	APRIL JOYCE had never felt this way about a car before. For almost two years, she followed the advance photos and reviews on the newly redesigned 2005 Mustang. ''The first time I saw it, I knew I had to have it,'' she said last week.
11/5/2004	My Life, My F-150 Pickup	WHO -- Jim Kallas, 40, disc jockey, Belle Fourche, S.D. WHAT -- 2004 Ford F-150 XLT Supercab South Dakota is pickup land. If you look up and down my block, just about everyone's got a pickup. It's a rural thing. We're a macho bunch out here, and a pickup is a man's vehicle. In the middle of nowhere, you need a truck that can pull its weight, whether you're hauling firewood or a refrigerator. When a relative has to move an appliance, I'm the first one to get the call.
11/4/2004	Ford Settles Investors' Suit Over I.P.O. Of Goldman	The Ford Motor Company agreed yesterday to settle a lawsuit that accused its chief executive of improperly accepting shares of the initial public offering of the Goldman Sachs Group, which agreed to pay $13.4 million under the deal. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court by Ford shareholders, said the chief executive and chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., received an allocation of 400,000 shares in 1999 because he was the chairman of Ford, which had deep banking ties with Goldman Sachs. The suit said Mr. Ford's acceptance ofthe shares was a ''usurpation of an opportunity that belonged to the company,'' according to the court documents.
10/31/2004	Transmission of Future or a Can of Worms?	THE continuously variable transmission, or C.V.T., is both the oldest and newest thing going in cars. The oldest because Leonardo da Vinci conceived the idea five centuries ago. The newest because Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz are developing the transmissions for introduction later in this decade. Manufacturers that have offered C.V.T.'s in past or present cars include Audi, Ford, Honda, Mini, Nissan, Saturn, Subaru and Toyota. The Ford Five Hundred has a C.V.T. when equipped with all-wheel drive; front-drive models offer a choice of C.V.T. or six-speed automatic.
10/31/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Ford Five Hundred; Mature Audiences Suggested	FELLOW boomers, can you hear the tick-tick-tick of the biological clock? Are your joints a little creaky when you roll out to greet the morning? Did you clutch your chest when the dreaded AARP card came in the mail? Relax. You're not just getting older, you're part of a new demographic. Ford feels your pain and offers ointment in the form of the 2005 Five Hundred, surely the oldest new car to be born in recent years.
10/28/2004	Arts, Briefly; Help From His Friends	William Clay Ford Jr., left, great-grandson of Henry Ford, has engineered a remarkable if still nascent turnaround at the auto manufacturer that bears his name. He is also helping to create a small sales boom at Barnes & Noble. Early this week, ''Ford Tough: Bill Ford and the Battle to Rebuild America's Automaker,'' by David Magee, jumped to No. 3 on Barnes & Noble's online best-seller list, largely due to purchases by Ford employees and retirees through Ford's internal Web site. The Ford site includes a special Barnes & Noble page featuring the book, sold at 40 percent off the $27.95 cover price, according to executives at Barnes & Noble and Ford. (At the same time, the book ranked no higher than No. 300 on Amazon.com.) The book, published by John Wiley & Sons, is a laudatory portrait of Mr. Ford, who granted the author access to Ford executives during the book's preparation. EDWARD WYATT
10/27/2004	Some Ford Models Do Poorly In First Results of Safety Tests	The government on Tuesday released the first batch of crash test results for 2005 model cars and trucks and it was not good news for the Ford Motor Company. The four-wheel drive versions of the Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickup trucks earned only two out of five stars in rollover ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
10/25/2004	A San Francisco agency hires a chief executive with experience on the other side of the table.	IN a push to reclaim a more prominent place in the industry, an agency is crossing over to the client side to hire a leader. Publicis & Hal Riney in San Francisco, part of the Publicis Groupe, is to announce today that Karen C. Francis will join the agency, effective next Monday, as chairwoman and chief executive. Although Ms. Francis has never worked on Madison Avenue, she has a lengthy rsum that includes jobs with blue-chip marketers like Ford Motor, General Motors and Procter & Gamble, and a brief foray into the dot-com realm.
10/24/2004	Wheel Is Turning Against S.U.V.'s	ABOUT once a month, without fail, as Bryan Feery drives his Hummer around Glastonbury, somebody holds up a hand as he passes by. The person isn't waving. ''Oh absolutely, I get the finger from people,'' he said.
10/21/2004	The Real Consequences of Pension Projections	When General Motors conducted its quarterly earnings teleconference last Thursday, the first question from Wall Street was not about Cadillac cars or Chevrolet trucks or the company's no-interest financing deals. It was about health care accounting. And that was before G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the auto supply giant Delphi disclosed this week that they were among six companies asked by the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide information as part of an inquiry into corporate pension and health care accounting practices.
10/20/2004	More Brazilian Drivers Turn to Ethanol	When Brazil's state-owned oil company announced this month that it was raising gasoline prices to keep up with the rising cost of crude oil, Gutemberg do Brasil Moreira barely blinked. Mr. Moreira is an oral surgeon who spends a good portion of his days battling traffic going to hospitals all over this sprawling metropolis. He drives a car that runs on either gasoline or ethanol, or any combination of the two. But with ethanol -- or alcohol, as most Brazilians call it -- selling at half the price of gasoline at the pump, Mr. Moreira does not waste any time deciding which fuel to use when filling up his three-month-old Volkswagen Fox.
10/20/2004	Ford Has Loss From Making Cars but Posts a Profit	The Ford Motor Company reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, but it lost money in its core business, making cars and trucks, for the second consecutive quarter. Ford, as well as General Motors and the auto supply giant Delphi, also said Tuesday that they had been asked to provide information to the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of an inquiry into accounting practices related to pension and health care expenses.
10/20/2004	S.E.C. Inquires Into Pension Accounting at Ford and G.M.	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that the federal government had asked them to provide information about how they account for their pension funds and retiree medical benefits, suggesting that a new inquiry into an area of accounting that has long troubled both investors and pension-rights advocates will cast a broad net. The two automakers joined the Delphi Corporation, which disclosed on Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had requested similar information. The commission is seeking e-mail messages and other documents that pertain to the actuarial assumptions that the companies have used since the year 2000 to calculate their pension values and other obligations to retirees.
10/18/2004	Ford to Offer Sirius Radio As an Option In More Cars	The Ford Motor Company plans to announce on Monday that it will offer Sirius Satellite Radio in more of its cars and trucks and that it will begin installing the satellite radio systems at its factories for the first time. After more than two years of taking a back seat to XM Satellite Radio, the industry leader, Sirius appears to be gaining momentum. This month, Howard Stern signed a five-year deal to broadcast exclusively on Sirius, starting in 2006. Sirius has also signed deals to broadcast games of the National Football League and the National Hockey League and to give Maxim magazine and the rapper Eminem their own channels.
10/17/2004	A Latter-Day Odyssey In Ford's Mythic Machine	GREETING us as we rumbled up to the entry booth in a waist-high automotive apparition, the park ranger looked down and asked, ''Is that an old car or a new one?'' It was a question I heard often during a three-day, 1,000-mile trip through California and Nevada in the 2005 Ford GT, a four-wheel fantasy that might have time-traveled from Le Mans, circa 1966. The answer, of course, is both.
10/15/2004	Is that Steve McQueen in the cornfield? Yes, brought back by Ford.	DETROIT is exhuming another face from the past to pitch its cars to a new generation. A digitally revived Steve McQueen, who died in 1980, will be reprising the character of Lt. Frank Bullitt in a commercial promoting the redesigned and retro Ford Mustang. The ad is part of a heavy push by the Ford Motor Company to convince Americans that a new crop of cars coming out this month are worth buying on their own merits, not because of a $5,000 rebate or zero-interest financing.
10/2/2004	Car Sales Up 5.6% in Month, With G.M. and Toyota in Lead	Auto sales rose 5.6 percent in September from last year, with General Motors and Toyota posting double-digit gains, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The strong September, which came after a disappointing August, was indicative of the roller coaster trend the industry, in particular the domestic automakers, has encountered for several months. Often, a sluggish sales month has been followed by a big surge as automakers come back with higher cash and financing incentives and more inventive marketing programs.
10/2/2004	Ford Lays Out A Move to Cut Auto Emissions	Top executives at the Ford Motor Company have privately endorsed an aggressive goal of reining in emissions from the automaker's vehicles by 2030, joining companies like BP and Toyota in approaching the issue as a business opportunity rather than a regulatory chore. Ford's goal, according to its own internal projections, would require an improvement of about 80 percent in the fuel economy of its cars and trucks by 2030, according to people who have been informed of the plan.
9/26/2004	Ford Parks Its Natural Gas Bandwagon	AFTER a decade spent preaching the gospel of clean-burning natural gas and winning converts among air-quality regulators and vehicle fleet operators, Ford is leaving the congregation. The company produced its final natural gas vehicles last month. Once those cars and trucks are delivered to customers, Ford says it will turn its full attention to the development of other types of green cars, including those that would run on hydrogen fuel cells. But existing customers and natural gas proponents say the move will have serious consequences, since Ford was the sole supplier of several types of vehicles.
9/26/2004	Climbing Down from the S.U.V., and Liking the View	WHEN Stafford Coakley went shopping for a new vehicle a year ago, he knew exactly what he didn't want: another sport utility vehicle. After driving a 1999 Nissan Pathfinder for three years, he said, he had had enough of the high cost of filling it with gasoline and what he considered an uncomfortable ride on his commute. And he had come to realize that there was not much more space in his Pathfinder than there was in many sedans. ''As an everyday vehicle, an S.U.V. just wasn't what I needed,'' said Mr. Coakley, an environmental engineer with the United States Army who lives in Baltimore. ''When I combined the cost of gas with the insurance and the maintenance, it was getting too expensive.''
9/18/2004	Ford Increases Its Forecast For 3rd Quarter	The Ford Motor Company raised its third-quarter earnings forecast on Friday and announced the beginning of a restructuring plan for its struggling Jaguar division. As part of the plan, Ford will cut 1,150 jobs in England, in large part by closing its 53-year-old Browns Lane assembly plant in Coventry. The company also said that Jaguar would sell its Formula One Racing business and refocus on its core business.
9/17/2004	Ford to Ship Electric Cars Back to Norway	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would ship as many as 300 Think electric cars back to Norway, sparing remnants of the failed project from the scrap heap. A Norwegian shipping company, Wilh. Wilhelmsen, a division of Wallenius Wilhelmsen, agreed to transport the cars from the United States and Europe at no cost to Ford, the company said. Cars judged acceptable for resale will be reconditioned and sold by Ford dealers in Norway, where they were originally made.
9/16/2004	Anticipating intense competition, carmakers tune up their images.	HAVE you heard about the presentation that agencies are making to automotive clients, encouraging them to spend more? Its title: ''Advertise. Because Oprah Can't Give Cars to Everyone.'' Of course, Madison Avenue will not actually make any such presentation as the 2005 model year gets under way. But the 276 new Pontiac G6 sport sedans that Oprah Winfrey presented to delighted members of her studio audience on Monday -- a product placement that cost General Motors more than $7 million -- are indicative of new initiatives by agencies and automakers as competition intensifies.
9/14/2004	National Briefing | Midwest: Michigan: Fires Lead To Volvo Recall	The Ford Motor Company's Volvo unit recalled 460,000 sedans and wagons worldwide, the biggest in Volvo's 76-year history, after at least seven fires in an engine fan. The recall covers all S60 and S80 sedans and the V70 and V70XC wagons from the 2000 and 2001 model years as well as some from 1999, said a Volvo spokesman, Dan Johnson. An overheated cooling fan caused the fires, with no accidents or injuries reported, Mr. Johnson said. The recall includes about 150,000 vehicles in the United States.
9/3/2004	Ford Engineers Join Union	Ford Motor engineers at a Michigan facility voted to join the United Automobile Workers after the automaker cut overtime pay for the 182 employees, the leader of the union effort said.
9/2/2004	G.M. and Ford to Cut Production	General Motors and Ford Motor said today that they would cut car and truck production in the fourth quarter by as much as 7 percent because vehicles were piling up unsold in inventory. Each company experienced a sharp drop in sales last month, along with the auto industry as a whole, new figures released today show. According to Ward's AutoInfoBank, the average number of new cars and light-duty trucks sold daily last month fell by 5.6 percent from August 2003.
8/28/2004	Detroit Fights California Bid to Open Car Pool Lanes to Fuel-Conscious Import	Larry David tools around in one on his HBO series. Cameron Diaz drives one in Los Angeles. So do Leonardo DiCaprio and Rob Reiner. Here in the state capital, top elected officials, including the state treasurer and the leader of the Senate, consider one a must-have environmental credential. In car- and image-obsessed California, the Toyota Prius, a hybrid gas-electric car that costs a fraction of the price tag of luxury vehicles normally associated with the state's freeways, has now even managed to win the affection of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
8/22/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Ford Focus ST; A 2nd Shot at Stardom For a Star-Crossed Car	WHEN Ford introduced a high-performance version of its compact Focus in 2002, it achieved something rarely accomplished by American automakers: a small car that was also great fun to drive. Of course, it was too good to last. The SVT Focus, which had received its ''tuner'' treatment from the Special Vehicles Team -- Ford's in-house performance-tuning shop -- was discontinued early this year. And the departure of that car, an exceptionally bright spot in a Focus line marred by quality glitches and serial recalls, was another in a series of disappointments for those who had seen great promise in Ford's small car.
8/10/2004	U.S. Regulators Release Vehicle Rollover Data	For the first time, federal regulators released figures yesterday that show how prone individual models of new cars and light-duty trucks are to roll over in an accident, exposing the occupants to high risk of death or serious injury. Instead of merely assigning a star rating to each model it tests, as it has done in the past, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released figures that allow consumers to compare rollover risk model by model. The star system, which is continuing, has been criticized for not providing enough information to distinguish among vehicles, because nearly all received three or four stars.
8/8/2004	IN THE REGION/New Jersey; Looking Ahead as Houses Keep Selling	THE number of home sales in New Jersey rose 11 percent in the first half of 2004 over the same period last year, according to the latest report from an East Brunswick-based appraisal company that supplies information on trends in home sales. Jeffrey Otteau, president of the company, the Otteau Appraisal Group, which publishes its quarterly findings at otteau.com, called the increase in sales strong evidence that the residential real estate market continues to thrive despite rising mortgage rates.
8/8/2004	The Perfect Lift On the Way To Cool	AS the August heat blooms, many of us fantasize not just about the beach or the lake or the pool but about how to get there, a supercool means of escape being as crucial to such daydreams as the destination. And in the stakes for the ultimate getaway vehicle, a sporty convertible -- a hot 2005 Porsche 997, a classic 1965 Mustang -- has a funny way of leaving competition in the dust. Not so for that girl of summer Malia Mills, the cool-chick swimwear designer who endeared herself to women everywhere by selling bikini tops and bottoms separately. ''The convertible comes with too many associations,'' Ms. Mills said. ''Whether you get the quirky Beetle or the chic Porsche or the cool old vintage Cadillac, they all come with so much personality that I feel it's hard to really be yourself.''
8/6/2004	Ford Delays Release of a Hybrid S.U.V.	The hybrid gasoline-electric version of the Ford Motor Company's Escape sport utility vehicle will not reach showrooms until October, a top executive said Thursday, delaying its release another month. ''We're producing them in very low volume right now,'' Jim Padilla, Ford's chief operating officer, said after a speech here. ''The one thing you don't do is produce 20 of them and say it's in the marketplace. You've got to get it in a number of dealerships.''
8/4/2004	Bargains Help Auto Industry Recover in July	Auto sales rebounded in July after a disappointing June, driven by hot products like the Toyota Sienna minivan and the Chrysler 300C sedan and by big incentives on sport utility vehicles, figures released on Tuesday showed. Ward's AutoInfoBank estimated that July's seasonally adjusted selling rate was 17.24 million units, a sharp increase from the 15.4 million-unit rate in June, the lowest in six years.
7/28/2004	Study Says Blacks Paid More for Honda Loans	A new study has found that black customers are almost twice as likely as whites to be charged a marked-up rate when they finance a purchase through the loan subsidiary of Honda Motor, and that on average, blacks are charged higher markups than whites. The study, covering nearly 400,000 people who borrowed from the American Honda Finance Corporation from June 1999 to March 2003, was conducted by Mark Cohen, a professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits against several automakers. His research has been at the center of those cases.
7/25/2004	Catching Up to the Cost of Global Warming	ONE does not often hear financial analysts talk about climate change, but this month John A. Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, organized a teleconference to address a troubling question for Detroit's automakers: As regulators around the world move to curb global-warming emissions from cars and improve fuel efficiency, what happens if Wall Street adds up the costs? The most likely answer will not make General Motors and Ford Motor very happy. Mr. Casesa's call included a presentation by the World Resources Institute, an environmental policy group in Washington, which recently issued a report on the subject with Sustainable Asset Management, an investment group based in Zurich.
7/22/2004	Detroit Profits Most From Loans, Not Cars	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company may be two of the world's largest automakers, but they continue to make their money as banks. So with interest rates rising, and competitors like the Toyota Motor Corporation far more profitable in the industry's core business of manufacturing cars and trucks, the market has reacted cautiously to the improved earnings reports by Ford on Tuesday and G.M. on Wednesday.
7/22/2004	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Ford To Build Third China Plant	Ford Motor will build a third factory in China to make cars with its Mazda Motor affiliate, part of a $1.5 billion investment to catch rivals who have expanded quicker in the world's third-biggest car market, said executives of the two companies who declined to be identified. Ford will sign an agreement with its Chinese partner, the Changan Ford Automobile Company on Thursday to build a factory in the eastern city of Nanjing, Ford and Mazda executives said. The Nanjing plant will be Ford's third Chinese assembly site as it tries to close the gap with General Motors, Toyota Motor and Volkswagen in the country. The carmaker will use the plant to build eight new models based on shared parts and platforms with Mazda, said the Ford and Mazda executives, declining to give details.
7/21/2004	Ford Profit Surges on Strength in Financing, Not Carmaking	The Ford Motor Company reported a $1.17 billion second-quarter profit on Tuesday, nearly tripling its earnings from the period a year earlier. But analysts are concerned that Ford relied so heavily on its lending division in the quarter and lost money in its core business: making cars and trucks.
7/10/2004	Chrysler Aloof, So Far, From Latest Incentive War	While General Motors and Ford are increasing incentives to combat slipping market share and rising inventories, Chrysler is holding back as it makes inroads on its two main rivals. G.M. announced this week that it was increasing its incentives on 2004 trucks and sport utility vehicles to $5,000, from $4,000, and is offering $4,000 cash back on most of its cars. It also expanded the rebates to include anyone who walks into the showroom. In June, the offer was only open to current owners of G.M. vehicles.
7/9/2004	FORD MOTOR'S CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER IS RETIRING	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that its chief strategy officer, Bruce L. Blythe, would retire on Sept. 1, less than a year after he rejoined the nation's second-biggest automaker, because the task he was hired for has been completed. Mr. Blythe, 59, took the job Sept. 10 last year, returning to the company he had been with from 1968 to 1993. The chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., wanted Mr. Blythe to help devise long-term strategy, and ''both agreed the mission has been accomplished,'' a spokeswoman, Marcey Evans, said. The strategy post will be dropped, she said. Mr. Blythe was an architect of European business plans in his first stint with Ford.
7/9/2004	DAIMLERCHRYSLER AND FORD AGREE TO INVEST IN BALLARD	DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor have agreed to invest $100 million in Ballard Power Systems, the biggest maker of fuel cells for automobiles, and to restructure their alliance with the company to speed development of alternative energy devices. DaimlerChrysler and Ford will give Ballard $58 million to develop a line of fuel cells and electronic drives, and gain control of Ballard, the chief executive of Ballard, Dennis Campbell, said yesterday. The United States is offering $1.2 billion in tax breaks and grants to spur creation of fuel cells, which are being developed to replace gasoline engines.
7/8/2004	G.M. AND FORD RAISE REBATES ON SEVERAL MODELS	General Motors increased rebates yesterday to $5,000 on most sport utility vehicles, its most profitable segment, and Ford Motor raised incentives on seven models after sales in the United States for the companies fell in June. General Motors, the world's biggest maker of cars and trucks, also raised rebates on most 2004-model cars and minivans to $4,000. The new General Motors incentives expire Aug. 2. Both automakers are increasing incentives to stem market-share losses to Asian automakers like Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, which are gaining without cutting prices as much. General Motors and Ford also want to bolster sales of sport utility vehicles and light trucks as gasoline prices hover near record highs.
7/4/2004	A Union Label, Inside Out	FOR more than half a century, Bea LaSorda's family history has been entwined with cars and Chrysler. Her father, Harry Rooney, led the local union in this small Canadian city across a slim river from Detroit. When she was a girl, he charged her, only half-jokingly, with keeping a lookout for Chrysler's company men while factory workers signed union cards in the basement. As a teenager, she watched Chrysler -- then and now the city's biggest employer -- try to throw him in jail. Her husband, Frank, another union leader, helped lead Chrysler through what were arguably its most difficult years -- those leading up to its 1980 bailout by the United States government, when Lee A. Iacocca was Chrysler's chief executive.
7/2/2004	Ford and G.M. Sales Both Fell More Than 11% in June	General Motors and Ford Motor said Thursday that their United States sales for June had double-digit declines, as Detroit continued to lose ground to Japanese and Korean rivals. Over all, sales in the United States were weaker than expected, down 5.97 percent from a year ago, when adjusted for an extra sales day this year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The seasonally adjusted selling rate for cars and light trucks tumbled to 15.4 million in June from 17.8 million in May, Ward's said.
6/27/2004	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2005 Ford Escape; An S.U.V. Passes Up A Major Makeover	EVERYWHERE you look this year, makeover shows are the rage, from ''The Swan'' to ''Extreme Makeover'' to ''I Want a Famous Face.'' Ford has joined the makeover parade, too, turning its engineers and designers loose on the 2005 model of its Escape utility wagon. And if the result doesn't exactly take your breath away, that is only testament to the Escape's solid fundamentals. The Escape's reworking was closer to a rejuvenating weekend at the spa than to a ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' transformation.
6/20/2004	What Lurks Inside Your Index Fund	THE extraordinarily long and wonderfully lucrative decline in interest rates is over. Are you ready for the coming seismic shift? Tumbling rates have kindled booms in stocks, bonds and real estate in recent years. They have also propelled shares of financial services companies, whose profits exploded as their capital costs sank. While rising rates will probably stop all of these booms, financial services stocks are particularly imperiled. And whether they know it or not, owners of equity index funds that mirror the Standard & Poor's 500 will be pained by the decline in these shares.
6/15/2004	Ford's Hybrid S.U.V. to Cost 15% More Than Gas Versions	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that prices for its new gasoline-electric Escape, the first sport utility vehicle to run on hybrid technology, will start at $26,380, about 15 percent more than models powered solely by gasoline. The Escape will cost $3,300 to $3,425 more than a comparably equipped 2005 V-6 gasoline-powered XLT version, Ford said. The company is introducing its first hybrid just as high gasoline prices erode the popularity of some light trucks. Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., estimates a front-wheel-drive Escape will get 35 to 40 miles per gallon in city driving, compared with 20 for gasoline-only models.
6/13/2004	After Years of Sludge, a Clash on the Cleanup; New Jersey Residents Want Ford to Do It Right This Time	When the Ford Motor Company closed its plant in Mahwah in 1980, the last car made there -- a two-tone beige Futura -- rolled off the assembly line and came to rest beneath a sign that exhorted workers to ''Do it Right the First Time.'' More than two decades later, people who live on land where Ford dumped thousands of cubic yards of chemical wastes from the plant are angry that the company did not live by its own rule.
6/8/2004	Some Popular S.U.V.'s Fare Badly in Rollover Tests	The rear-wheel-drive version of the Ford Explorer, the nation's best-selling sport utility vehicle, tipped up on two wheels during a rollover test performed by the government, according to results released Monday. The news comes less than a week after a woman paralyzed in an Explorer rollover accident won a $369 million judgment against the Ford Motor Company.
6/3/2004	National Briefing | West: California: Ford Loses Rollover Case	The Ford Motor Company lost its first case in 14 trials involving rollovers of its Explorer sport utility vehicle and was ordered by a San Diego jury to pay $122 million to a paralyzed California woman. The woman, Benetta Buell-Wilson, 49, was injured in January 2002 when her 1997 Explorer flipped over as she tried to steer around a metal obstruction on a highway. A spokeswoman said that the company would appeal.
6/1/2004	At Mustang Party in Queens, It's All Shine and Shop Talk	When Reid Gibson went to the World's Fair at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in 1964 as a 9-year-old boy, there was one must-see exhibit: Ford Motor Company's unveiling of its nifty new sports car, the Mustang. ''I remember getting here and my grandfather saying, 'Let's go, we got to see the new Fords,''' he recalled at the park yesterday. ''He was a Ford man.''
5/20/2004	The Big Three Fear That Toyota Is Becoming the Big One	Toyota may not quite be the world's largest automaker, based on vehicle sales, but it is firmly buckled in the industry's driver's seat. That reality was reinforced last week when Toyota reported $10.2 billion in earnings for its latest fiscal year, which ended in March, the most ever made in a single year by a Japanese company.
5/9/2004	The Undoing Of the Industrial Revolution	IT was 1989 when Bobby Bollettino stood in front of the J.L. Prescott Company, where he was a line operator in the bleach department, and wondered about his future now that the plant was closing and the operation was shifting to Illinois. About 295 employees were losing their jobs at the plant, which manufactured household cleaning products, along with 150 more at a sister plant in Lincoln Park. As Mr. Bollettino, the president of Local 284 of the United Textile Workers of America, studied the weathered brick buildings where he had worked for 21 years, he sensed his life was coming apart.
5/7/2004	G.M. JOINS RIVALS IN INCREASING REBATES ON SPORT UTILITIES	General Motors added $1,000 to rebates on midsize sport utility vehicles like the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, a day after Ford and DaimlerChrysler raised their incentives for sport utilities. The increase doubles, to $2,000, the rebates consumers can use with existing no-interest loan offers of up to five years, a G.M. spokeswoman said. The offers end June 1. Ford and Chrysler increased rebates after Toyota and Nissan won market share in April.
5/7/2004	He Does Get Some Respect, but the Critics Still Have His Number	Not long ago, William Clay Ford Jr., chief executive of Ford Motor, found himself signing autographs for some young admirers. ''I only have two heroes in my life, and he's one of them,'' said Christopher Larsch, a 12-year-old clearly being groomed for management by his mother, a Ford accountant. Chris, wearing an outsize Detroit Red Wings jersey, was among a throng crowding Mr. Ford at company headquarters here during Take Our Children to Work Day.
5/6/2004	FORD AND CHRYSLER RAISE LIGHT TRUCK INCENTIVES	Ford and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have increased incentives on light trucks after Toyota and Nissan gained market share last month. Ford is offering $1,000 and no-interest 60-month loans on Explorer sport utility vehicles, Excursion and Expedition S.U.V.'s and Freestar minivans, a spokesman, Jim Cain, said. Chrysler added $2,000 to incentives on the Durango sport utility, to a total $3,500, a spokesman, Kevin McCormick, said. General Motors has offered similar incentives since April 1. The American automakers' share of the light truck market in the first four months of this year slid to 71.9 percent from 73.8 percent a year earlier.
5/5/2004	Auto Sales Lower Than Expected in April	Sales of several popular large sport utility vehicles, including the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford Expedition and Cadillac Escalade, tailed off in April, but automakers generally insist that high gas prices are not changing the purchase decisions of customers. Sales of sport utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks continue to dominate the market, but there were signs of a shift from the largest S.U.V.'s to smaller ones in the auto industry's April sales reports, which were released on Monday and Tuesday.
5/4/2004	Ford's Sales Fell 4.4% Last Month	Sales at the Ford Motor Company fell 4.4 percent in April from a year earlier, the company reported today, even though it relied more heavily on discounted deals with rental car companies than in previous months. The performance raised some questions about the sustainability of Ford's strong first-quarter earnings. ''We bogeyed April,'' said George Pipas, Ford's chief industry sales analyst. ''We put more weight on our track record over the last eight months, and that has been good.''
5/4/2004	In Door Safety Cases, Ford Settles and a Mother Struggles	Deborah Seliner says she does not remember the accident, just one moment when she was driving her used 1997 Ford pickup along Highway 6 near College Station and the next moment when she was in the dark carrying on a conversation with someone she decided was God. She was begging him, ''God, please, if that is you, let me live for my babies.'' Her truck, she found later, had blown a rear tire, sending her off the road onto a grassy divider. The truck rolled over, ejecting her, even though she had apparently been wearing a seat belt, through the open driver's side door and hurling her 20 yards onto the pavement.
4/24/2004	CARMAKERS LIMIT NEW YORK LEASES	Two years ago, shopping for a sporty Chevrolet Cavalier, Jessica Coutsonikas took the route of many a first-time car-buyer short on cash but long on desire: she decided to lease. But when she went to DePaula Chevrolet here on Thursday to lease a new car, she discovered that in New York, leasing the Cavalier was no longer an option.
4/23/2004	A Shake-Up at Ford, in Part to Stop the Infighting	The chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor, William Clay Ford Jr., shook up his management team Thursday, appearing to resolve lingering questions of friction among his top lieutenants. A younger generation of top executives, in their early 40's and 50's, also emerged in what was a reorganization of the company's management structure. James J. Padilla, 57, was named chief operating officer and chairman of worldwide automotive operations. Nicholas V. Scheele, 60, the company president who has been Mr. Ford's top deputy, is relinquishing the chief operating job and will turn over day-to-day leadership of global automotive operations to Mr. Padilla.
4/22/2004	Better Pricing And Cost Cuts Raise Profit At Ford	The Ford Motor Company said on Wednesday that its first-quarter earnings more than doubled, in large part because of cost cuts and favorable pricing trends. Ford's quarterly results also topped those of General Motors for the first time in three years. Both Ford and G.M., which reported its profit on Tuesday, easily beat Wall Street estimates. Ford also broke from a recent cycle in Detroit by making more money in its automotive operations than it did from financing car loans for the first time in four years.
4/18/2004	A Fuel-Saving Proposal From Your Automaker: Tax the Gas	SOME people have wacky ideas, like taxing gasoline more so people drive less.'' So said a recent television ad from the Bush presidential campaign, set to jaunty music from the silent-movie era, that linked Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, to a 50-cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax. Actually, Mr. Kerry told a Boston Globe reporter a decade ago that he supported such a measure at the time to help cut the deficit, but he has never introduced it in legislation or voted for it.
4/16/2004	History Bows At a Ford Plant	''EVERYBODY who comes to Detroit wants to see a car made,'' said Scott Mallwitz, director of experience design at the Henry Ford museum. Next month, the Ford Motor Company will try to satisfy everybody with a new tour of what is perhaps the most historic auto plant and now arguably the most modern: the renovated Ford Rouge Center in Dearborn, Mich. The stereotypical image of an automobile factory is one of workers scurrying about as thousands of components meld into a car that is driven away at the end of an assembly line. But car plants don't look like that anymore. At the new Rouge, automated machines do much of the assembly. Welding robots don't resemble R2-D2, the cute little ''astromech droid'' of the ''Star Wars'' movies, but rather chickens at feeding time, though they are barely visible inside their safety cages. The lasers that weld steel are hidden, too, by opaque shields.
4/12/2004	Miscellany	J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group, expanded a division devoted to seeking ways to integrate advertising and entertainment content, called the Brand Entertainment Group, by combining it with Showcase, part of a WPP sibling, Hill & Knowlton. The merged division, known as Amplify, will be based in Los Angeles and work primarily for the Ford Motor Company.
4/10/2004	24-Hour Test Drives Seem to Pass Carmakers' Test as a Sales Tool	With big cash incentives appearing to lose some of their power to attract uyers, General Motors and several other automakers are extending 24-hour test drives and other hands-on marketing programs, particularly for featured new models that they would rather not sell at a steep discount. On April 1, for example, G.M. started the fourth round of its 24-hour test drives, which let potential customers take a car home overnight so they can better see how much cargo it carries, how their children fit in the back seat, or how the neighbors react. In the year since the program began, about 650,000 people have taken part, and roughly one-third bought the cars they tested.
4/8/2004	In Ford's Tomorrow, Fuel-Saving Hybrids And a Luxury Lincoln	Higher gas prices might not be making Americans rush to buy small cars, but William Clay Ford Jr. says his company is preparing for a future of more sticker shock at the pump. Mr. Ford, the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday that his company now planned to make three hybrid vehicles, two by the 2007 model year. He also said it would redouble efforts to build more efficient vehicles. This year, Ford, if it sticks to its current product plan, will become the third automaker to sell a hybrid vehicle, offering a version of its Escape sport utility vehicle.
4/7/2004	BOLDFACE NAMES	Did We Mention Our Uncle Once Met Rosalynn Carter? In honor of this week's Pulitzer Prize announcements, let us turn away from the glitterati and toward the noble souls who are devoted to chronicling their lives. In particular, let us listen to what the photographers had to say on Monday when BRUCE WILLIS, who was at Planet Hollywood for a screening of his new movie, ''The Whole Ten Yards,'' asked a group of foster children to come onto the stage for photographs:
4/6/2004	FORD SEDAN, NO LONGER FUTURA, NEEDS A NEW NAME	Ford Motor dropped the Futura name for a new sedan after Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack, the auto parts and service chain, objected because it uses the name for tires. The automaker has not yet decided on a new name for the car, which goes into production in 2005, a spokesman, Jim Cain, said. Pep Boys sells more than six million Futura tires a year, said Bill Furtkevic, a spokesman for the company, which is based in Philadelphia. He said Ford declined an offer to license the name. The car, which made its debut at the 2003 New York auto show, is intended to compete with the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord.
4/5/2004	Carmakers Have a New Idea. It's Called a Car.	Detroit, which has long feasted on trucks, says it has rediscovered the car. Will the public buy it?
4/3/2004	CHIEF EXECUTIVE ACQUIRES MORE FORD MOTOR SHARES	The Ford Motor Company's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., acquired 1.44 million company shares, increasing his holdings by 53 percent, the company said yesterday. Mr. Ford, 46, received 27,624 restricted shares as salary for this year's first quarter and must hold them for at least a year, a spokeswoman, Becky Bach, said. He also exercised options for 1.41 million shares that he will keep, she said. The stock acquisition increased his shares of Ford common stock to 4.15 million, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
4/2/2004	For Americans, Gas Guzzlers Are Again Kings Of the Road	Gasoline prices may be at an all-time high, but that is not deterring Americans from buying gas guzzlers. Maintaining a trend that dates back more than a decade, American buyers continued to shift from passenger cars to the largest and least fuel-efficient new vehicles that auto manufacturers offer, even as gasoline prices soar, according to the industry's March sales reports.
3/29/2004	People	Jan Valentic, vice president for global marketing at the Ford Motor Co., Detroit, is leaving to join a Ford agency, Young & Rubicam Brands, New York, part of the WPP Group, in a new post, executive vice president and global client leader, overseeing the Microsoft account. At Ford, her duties will be realigned under James O'Connor, group vice president for North American marketing, sales and service. Steven Feuling was named chief marketing officer, a new post, at Starcom USA, Chicago, part of the Starcom Worldwide division of the Starcom MediaVest Group, owned by the Publicis Groupe. He had most recently been senior vice president for marketing at Kmart, Troy, Mich., owned by Kmart Holdings. Also at Starcom USA, John Muszynski, executive vice president and chief broadcast investment officer, was promoted to a new post, managing director for investment and operations.
3/28/2004	Carmakers Pull Plug On Electric Vehicles	FIVE to 10 years ago, when the future seemed to belong to electric cars -- and California clean-air rules forced reluctant automakers to offer them -- a small but enthusiastic group of optimists and environmentalists signed on as pioneers. While a few bought electrics outright, most signed leases that obliged them to return the vehicles after a few years. Regulators and auto manufacturers have since pinned their hopes on newer technologies, like hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles and, further in the future, hydrogen cars. Electric autos have become orphans, abandoned in favor of more promising offspring.
3/23/2004	Would you base the purchase of a car on the prose of a chick-lit novelist? Ford hopes so.	PRODUCT placement continues to push its way into prose. The latest corporate sponsor between bookends is the Ford Motor Company, whose British division recently struck a deal with British novelist Carole Matthews. Ms. Matthews writes books and short stories in the genre known as chick lit, which was made famous by Helen Fielding, author of ''Bridget Jones's Diary.'' Chick lit, Ms. Matthews explained in an interview, is ''edgy romantic comedy aimed at young contemporary women.''
3/22/2004	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; For Mustang Owners, the First Love Is the Sweetest	LOVE at first sight is not something that happens only between people. In 1964, tens of thousands of car buyers were swept off their feet by the alluring shape of a sporty new Ford called the Mustang; four decades later, many of those relationships endure. Harrel McKinney of Montgomery, Ala., was one of those whose heart was stolen, falling hard for a Wimbledon White coupe with a 260-cubic-inch V-8. In his case, there was not even a car in the first glimpse -- just a picture in the dealer's showroom.
3/22/2004	Celebrating As a Pony Turns 40	THE celebrations for Mustang's 40th -- the marketing part, at least -- began last fall, when Ford released an anniversary trim option for 2004 models. The $895 package adds sportier wheels, stripes to the hood, rocker panels and trunk, and anniversary logos to the seatbacks and center console. If your budget doesn't allow you to celebrate with a new car, commemorative hats, racing jackets, wall clocks, die-cast models and even a special edition of the Monopoly board game are available from retailers and collector groups.
3/14/2004	They'll Never Run Out of Gas, But Time Is Another Matter	THE eerily silent, bubble-shaped plastic cars are adorable, looking more like clownmobiles than like responsible, serious two-seater commuter vehicles. They invariably inspire the devotion of drivers and the admiration of bystanders. And now, after two years, the pilot program to introduce these electric cars to Westchester commuters as part of a highly publicized experiment in supporting a nonpolluting alternative to the station car, the New York Power Authority program is nearing an end. Despite promises at the outset that it would continue, there now seems to be no prospect that it will.
3/14/2004	Personal Business; Covet That Car? For a Price, You Can Cut in Line	IF you must be the first on your block to drive one of this year's hottest cars, Internet-based auctions are making it easier to jump to the head of the line. But car experts list caveats for people who use these auctions, whether they are buying or selling a position on a dealer's waiting list. First, expect to pay a lot of money -- often tens of thousands of dollars -- to be first in line for cars like the redesigned 2005 Chevrolet Corvette or the Ford GT, both due later this year. And you may have to investigate what you are bidding against: a few dealers have been known to masquerade as consumers on online auctions, to ratchet up the price. There are two types of these auctions, whether on eBay or on sites for car enthusiasts. One is offered by a dealer, selling places on a waiting list for high-demand cars it has been allotted. Sometimes that may mean just one car; other times, there may be dozens of auctions for dozens of cars. The other type of auction is run by individuals who want to sell their places on waiting lists -- places they may have reserved months or even years in advance, sometimes by making deposits with dealers. In some cases, people on the lists may decide that they do not want the cars after all. Others, however, may have gotten on the list solely to make a profit.
3/12/2004	G.M. Says Costs For Retiree Care Top $60 Billion	General Motors said on Thursday that its future health care obligation for retirees rose last year to $63.4 billion, from $57 billion in 2002. If not for the effects of the new Medicare legislation signed in December by President Bush, the obligation would have been $67.5 billion. The figures were disclosed in the company's annual report, which was released on Thursday. Many domestic manufacturers say that soaring health care costs have become their chief competitive burden.
3/10/2004	Ford to Use Toyota's Hybrid Technology	The Ford Motor Company will license hybrid technology from the Toyota Motor Corporation in a deal that could help establish Toyota's system as a standard for the industry. Toyota has been trying to sell its hybrid system to a variety of automakers to help offset its high development cost. Ford will incorporate the Toyota technology into a hybrid system it plans to introduce late this year in a gasoline-electric version of its Escape sport utility vehicle, the two companies said yesterday in a statement.
3/8/2004	Chrysler waves a cease-and-desist letter and Ford's commercial for a foldaway seat vanishes.	THE Ford Motor Company's latest advertisement for its Freestar minivan has disappeared faster than the foldaway seat feature it was promoting. Ford said last week that it had stopped running a commercial for its the minivan after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from its crosstown rival, Chrysler.
2/27/2004	Another Recall Involving Ford, Firestone Tires And S.U.V.'s	Auto safety regulators said on Thursday that Bridgestone/Firestone North America had begun the first tire recall since the government started using a new early warning system created in the wake of the rollover problems of Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires in the late 1990's. The latest recall again involves both Firestone and the Ford Motor company. About 290,000 Firestone tires will be replaced on Ford Excursion sport utility vehicles; the move comes after accidents that have been linked to five deaths. A Ford official said the tires, which were made at a plant in Joliette, Quebec, were used on about 80,000 Ford Excursions, including 2000, 2001, 2002 and some early 2003 models. The tires are Steeltex Radial A/T tires in size LT265/75R16, Load Range D.
2/27/2004	With Last 50 Pickups, Ford Ends 56 Years of Work in Edison	The Ford Motor Company ceased production at its sprawling assembly plant here on Thursday, ending 56 years as a manufacturing fixture in north-central New Jersey and stripping away yet another major name from the state's industrial base. The closing of operations was ceremonial and bittersweet. During a shortened final shift, workers turned out the last 50 of the nearly 1.7 million small pickup trucks the plant has produced since the early 1990's and then retired to the cafeteria for a midmorning sendoff of hot dogs, soft drinks and cake. Afterward, some workers drifted away to bars and diners for their goodbyes.
2/27/2004	In New 'Starsky & Hutch,' One 70's Star Makes a Comeback	NEXT Friday, when Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson resurrect ''Starsky & Hutch'' as the title detectives in a film to be released that day, the only star reprising an original role will be the famous flashy red Gran Torino with the white swoosh stripe. The 70's retro chic, 180-degree-spinning, rubber-burning mean machine will make its movie debut, 25 years after retiring from television. The car was cast against type. In 1974, the Ford Gran Torino, hefty fourth-generation descendant of the original '68 Torino, was built more as a family car than the earlier, high-performance models. Producers of the TV series ''Starsky and Hutch,'' however, saw acting potential in the four-wheeled behemoth. They gave the two-door hardtop its big break -- and a makeover, adding cosmetic toughness, most noticeably in a bright red paint job and slotted mag wheels.
2/26/2004	An environmental group's depiction of Ford's chief exposes hostilities between onetime allies.	STUNG by the depiction of its chairman and chief executive as Pinocchio in an advertisement, the Ford Motor Company has sent a cease-and-desist letter to an environmental group responsible for the ad. Ford is demanding that the group, Bluewater Network, which is based in San Francisco, stop ''unlawful conduct'' in a print and Internet campaign that attacks Ford's environmental policies.
2/24/2004	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Ford Factory Site Chosen	The Changan Ford Automobile Corporation, the venture of the Ford Motor Company with the Changan Group of Chongqing, said that it had signed a memorandum of understanding to obtain the land use rights for construction of a plant in Nanjing, 142 miles northwest of Shanghai. Changan Ford said that it would decide later what model would be built at the plant, declining to confirm expectations that the Ford Focus compact car would be chosen. The venture already makes the Fiesta and the Mondeo at a plant in Chongqing, 800 miles up the Yangtze River from Shanghai; the new factory will make it easier to sell cars in affluent coastal areas. Keith Bradsher (NYT)
2/19/2004	Ford Said to Be Planning Assembly Plant in China	The Ford Motor Company is strongly leaning toward the selection of Nanjing to be the site for a large new assembly plant in China, as the cornerstone of a plan to invest more than $1 billion in the world's fastest-growing auto market, people close to the company said this week. The assembly plant would most likely produce versions of the Ford Focus, these people said. The Focus, a compact, is one of the company's newest and more technologically advanced models; it succeeded the Escort in the American market.
2/16/2004	A Shade of Green: S.U.V.'s Try to Soften Image	Can the sport utility vehicle, the bte noire of environmental advocates, be reinvented as a green machine? This year, Ford and Toyota plan to sell the first two hybrid sport utility vehicles. With carlike mileage expected, the advent of the hybrid S.U.V. may change the uniformly visceral antipathy to sport utility vehicles among environmental advocates, even if automakers are unlikely to sell enough hybrids to significantly reduce fuel consumption or pollution any time soon.
2/6/2004	Technology Briefing | Software: Compuware To Buy Remaining Covisint Assets	The Compuware Corporation has agreed to buy the Covisint Internet venture that was created by automakers including Ford and General Motors. The value of the deal was not disclosed. The acquisition will add 1 or 2 cents a share to profit in the year ending in March 2005, the Detroit-based Compuware said yesterday. Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler created Covisint, based in Southfield, Mich., in February 2000 to cut their purchasing costs by communicating with suppliers electronically. Compuware shares rose 15 cents, to $7.93.
2/5/2004	Ratings Seem to Show Less Chance of a Rollover	For the first time, some truck-based sport utility vehicles received as many as four out of five stars in rollover ratings, according to 2004 model ratings released yesterday by federal regulators. But the higher ratings may not necessarily mean the vehicles have become safer, because the government has changed the way it tests them. In the new tests, using real vehicles on a test track as well as mathematical calculations, the four-wheel-drive versions of several similar sport utility vehicles made by General Motors -- the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, Oldsmobile Bravada and the new Buick Rainier -- earned four stars, even though they are virtually identical to G.M. vehicles that rated only three stars last year.
2/4/2004	Incentives and New S.U.V. Help Chrysler Bolster Sales	By offering incentives worth more than $1,000 and a range of new sport utility models, the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler and several Japanese automakers racked up sales gains in January even as General Motors and the Ford Motor Company posted declines. Chrysler said its sales increased 9 percent last month compared with the corresponding month in 2003 after adjusting for one extra selling day this January. Including Mercedes, sales for DaimlerChrysler over all rose 7.7 percent, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data tracking service in Southfield, Mich.
1/31/2004	FORD PLANS LAYOFFS AT FACTORY NEAR ST. LOUIS	The Ford Motor Company plans to lay off about 1,000 workers at an assembly plant near St. Louis on April 26 as part of job cuts agreed to with its biggest union. The automaker is reducing production at the Hazelwood, Mo., plant to one shift from two, a spokesman, Ed Lewis, said. The factory has about 2,700 workers and produces the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles. Ford agreed in last year's national contract talks with the United Auto Workers to cut a shift at the Missouri factory rather than follow through on a 2002 plan to close the plant.
1/27/2004	Toyota Overtakes Ford as World's No. 2 Automaker	Toyota knocked the Ford Motor Company from its longtime position as the world's second-largest automaker last year, according to Toyota's final sales results, which were released on Monday. Now all that stands between Toyota and first place is General Motors, setting up a challenge to America's dominance over the global auto industry that has been years in the making. Executives at Toyota have repeatedly protested that selling more vehicles than Ford or G.M. is not their goal, in and of itself.
1/23/2004	Ford Reports 2003 Profit But Posts Loss In 4th Quarter	Led by its financial unit, the Ford Motor Company reported a slim profit for 2003 on Thursday, after losing more than $6 billion over the previous two years. But in the fourth quarter, Ford said, its loss grew from the quarter a year earlier, largely because of a $1.6 billion charge taken primarily to cover health care and other benefits for 20,000 Ford production workers who remain at its former subsidiary, the parts maker Visteon.
1/11/2004	Business; Car Dealerships Face the Great Homogenization	IT'S not that Wendy Kent Churchill doesn't want a shiny new showroom. She just wishes that it could look like a place to buy a luxury vehicle, rather than a military barracks. But the macho, pared-down look is what the Hummer division of General Motors is pushing Ms. Churchill, a Fort Worth, Tex., auto dealer, to build. Unlike some automakers, she said, the company is not offering any financial help to add a new showroom. It doesn't have to, Ms. Churchill said, because so many competitors are vying for the right to sell new Hummers.
1/10/2004	Big Three Hope Rising Economy Will Lift All Vehicles	The Big Three are putting a bullish face on 2004, predicting that a wave of new products, aided by an improving economy, will increase earnings and might even cool off their price war. The first week of the year is always a big one in Detroit, opening with the press preview of the North American International Auto Show, where the industry shows off its new cars and trucks with plenty of pomp, rock and smoke machines.
1/6/2004	Detroit to Focus on Tastes as Its Market Share Decreases	The strengthening economy and generous sales incentives led to robust car sales last year, automakers said Monday, but the American companies' share of the market continued to shrink as import brands like Toyota, Honda and BMW posted the biggest gains. Despite those declines, the American companies did not pledge to increase market share in 2004, as they have often done. Instead, they said they would look for ways to make the cars and trucks that they do sell more profitable, largely by making them more appealing to consumers.
1/6/2004	Automakers Unveil Plans for More Hybrid Models	The number of fuel-efficient hybrid models available in the United States will more than double in the next year, to seven from three, with new entries coming from Toyota, Honda and Ford Motor. Two of the new vehicles were announced at the North American International Auto Show -- one of the auto industry's most important annual product previews -- which opened here Sunday for the news media.
1/4/2004	A Designer Lets Loose In the 'Year of the Car'	WHEN the Ford Motor Company landed J Mays as design chief in 1997, it was considered something of a coup. Well spoken and well coiffed, Mr. Mays was among the most celebrated and daring young designers in the business. In his previous job, he had presided over the imaginative reinvention of the Volkswagen Beetle into a car that managed to revive the old Bug's spirit while being thoroughly modern at the same time. At Ford, Mr. Mays has applied a similar makeover to the legendary Thunderbird, but over all, his stamp on the company has been hard to discern.
1/4/2004	In Detroit, Home Teams Swing for the Fences	THE Detroit Tigers ended their season a game shy of the modern record for most losses by a major league baseball team. The Lions, with just 5 wins and 11 losses, are sitting out the N.F.L. playoffs. There is hope, at least, for the Red Wings in hockey and the Pistons of the N.B.A. Hopeful, too, are the roughed-up home teams of the auto industry as they kick off 2004 on their home turf in the rollicking, bruising, cheerleading spectacle known as the North American International Auto Show.
1/1/2004	FreeMarkets Agrees to Buy Auction Unit of Covisint	FreeMarkets, which makes Internet-auction software, is buying the auto parts auction business of Covisint, a venture of General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler. FreeMarkets, which is based in Pittsburgh and expects to conclude the purchase in January, will fulfill parts contracts with the three automakers using its software for three years, the companies said in a statement yesterday. Terms were not disclosed.
12/23/2003	Ford Will Take a Charge In Visteon Revamping Plan	The Ford Motor Company announced a sweeping restructuring yesterday of its relationship with the Visteon Corporation, its main parts supplier. As part of the restructuring, Ford said it would take a pretax charge of $1.65 billion against its fourth-quarter earnings to assume the retirement health care liabilities of Visteon employees. Ford also raised its 2003 earnings estimates. For the year, the company said earnings should be $1.05 to $1.10 a share, up from its previous estimate of 95 cents to $1.05 a share. The estimates exclude the Visteon charge and other items.
12/20/2003	Critics Attack Secret Deals By Middlemen To Buy Drugs	The middleman companies that manage drug benefits for millions of American workers are under growing pressure from government officials, big employers and some drug makers to end their practice of cutting secret deals with drug companies, deals that often favor sales of expensive drugs. Already, some of the companies, known as pharmacy benefit managers, have made formal promises to inform their customers fully about any rebates or other deals they make with manufacturers. More such moves could not only upend the industry's business model but result in substantially lower drug costs for employers and workers, according to industry executives and analysts. Because the companies are expected to manage the new Medicare drug benefit, the savings could extend to the elderly, as well.
12/16/2003	Metro Briefing | New York: Albany: Ford Urged To Revamp Police Cars	The Ford Motor Company, maker of a car that police unions say bursts into flames when hit from behind, should include a fire-suppression system as a standard feature of the 2005 police car version, according to a report by the New York State Senate. Ford has offered to make such a system an option for the Police Interceptor, the 2005 Crown Victoria model that is made for patrol duty. State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, left, Republican of Yonkers, made his recommendation in a new report by the Committee on Investigation and Government Operations, which he heads. Kristen Kinley, a Ford spokeswoman, said the fire-suppression system now being developed would not be standard because not all police vehicles ''require such advanced technology, designed primarily for high-risk patrol such as highways.'' In December 2002, a state trooper was killed when a Jeep Cherokee crashed into his Crown Victoria. Al Baker (NYT)
12/9/2003	Many Trucks, But Not All, Face Redesign In Safety Plan	Many of the largest sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, from the Cadillac Escalade to the Toyota Sequoia, will need to be redesigned to comply with the industry's new plan to make such vehicles less dangerous to people riding in cars. A few companies, however, are already largely in compliance with the industry's voluntary plan to redesign the front ends of light trucks, specifically S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks. The Ford Motor Company, for example, has redesigned even its largest S.U.V.'s -- including the giant Excursion and the Lincoln Navigator -- in such a way that they already meet the new requirement. The 15 companies that agreed to the voluntary standards have until 2009 to put safer models on the road.
12/8/2003	A British Eye for Ford Design	PETER HORBURY has been appointed Ford's next executive director for North American design, replacing J Mays. Mr. Horbury was previously the chief designer of the company's Premier Automotive Group, which includes Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo. Ford recently closed Ingeni, the London design studio where Mr. Horbury had his office. Mr. Mays was promoted this summer to the inner circle of eight group vice presidents at Ford, where he is adding marketing and brand issues to his design responsibilities. ''Peter has my old job,'' Mr. Mays said. ''I will be spending more focus on marketing. But we will tag-team each other in the jobs as he learns.''
12/7/2003	A Tale of Two Troubled Turnarounds	HOW does the Motor City spell desperation? P-A-N-T-I-E-S!
12/3/2003	Revived Economy Helped Lift Automakers' November Sales	Sales at General Motors, BMW and Honda's luxury division, Acura, all surged last month, largely because of the rebounding economy, automakers said Tuesday. DaimlerChrysler said its sales rose slightly in November from the month a year ago, while the Ford Motor Company's sales showed a decline. G.M. said its sales grew 22 percent in November, with truck sales up 30 percent and the Cadillac division up 43 percent. Honda reported record sales for Acura, a gain of 24.7 percent over last year. BMW said it had its best November sales ever; sales increased 6.4 percent over all, led by an 18 percent increase for the Mini.
11/27/2003	Ford Chairman, Now Confident Of Turnaround, Expects a Profit	Despite billions in losses over the last few years, a shrinking market share worldwide and falling credit ratings, the Ford Motor Company is meeting its turnaround targets and is poised to return to profitability and make a run at environmental leadership, Ford's chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., says. ''We have gone from the intensive-care unit, where everything was critical and we were putting out fires,'' Mr. Ford said in an interview on Tuesday marking the end of the second year of his five-year plan to save the company that his great-grandfather founded a century ago. ''I really look to the next phase now, in terms of us gaining leadership and being the kind of company that I'd like us to be, and I feel we're poised now to be able to do that.''
11/23/2003	Business People; Oprah's Audience Wonders: Chair No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3?	If rebates and discounts become any bigger, Detroit will be giving away cars, or so goes the joke making the rounds in the auto industry. Last week, Ford did just that -- at least one car, anyway. During a segment of her show about bargain shopping, Oprah Winfrey told members of her audience to look under their seats. One found the keys to a red Ford Focus sedan, valued at $16,000. ''Isn't this fun? Thank you, Ford,'' Ms. Winfrey said.
11/21/2003	FORD PLANS TO INVEST IN PLANTS IN MICHIGAN AND OHIO	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would invest as much as $325 million at plants in Michigan and Ohio to produce a new, more fuel-efficient transmission. The spending includes $170 million for a factory in Livonia, Mich., and $155 million for a plant in Sharonville, Ohio. The transmission, a rear-wheel-drive, six-speed automatic version, increases efficiency as much as 8 percent compared with a four-speed model, Ford said. Most of the new transmissions will be used in trucks and S.U.V.'s.
11/16/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Focus PZEV; A Stealthy Operative In the War on Pollution	AT first glance, the Ford Focus PZEV, which combines gasoline-engine practicality with ultraclean tailpipe emissions, seems to be the gift that no one asked for. Car owners who care about their vehicles' evaporative emissions performance, or the rate at which catalytic converters heat up, seem few and far between. But there is growing evidence that consumers will seek out environmentally responsible vehicles if they do not have to make a tradeoff in terms of lower performance or a higher price. Few people paid attention to fuel economy in 1987, when a survey by J.D. Power & Associates found that only 3 percent of consumers considered it the most important factor in buying a new car. But a survey this year by the same company indicated that gas mileage is now the top consideration of 15 percent of car shoppers, and the fifth-highest priority.
11/13/2003	China Lowers the Wall for U.S. Cars and Parts	In a move to quell criticism of its huge trade surplus with the United States, China agreed to let the Big Three automakers send it about 15,000 cars and trucks over the next couple of years as well as more than $1 billion in parts from General Motors, the companies said Wednesday. China also said that it would allow G.M. to import cars directly, without using a local partner, and G.M. said it was moving into the auto lending business in China.
11/13/2003	Debt Rating Of Ford Motor Is Downgraded By Agency	Standard & Poor's lowered the Ford Motor Company's debt to its lowest investment grade rating on Wednesday, reflecting skepticism about the company's turnaround plan and a gloomy view of the domestic auto industry. ''Strong demand has not made for strong financial performance by these three automakers,'' said Scott Sprinzen, a credit analyst for Standard & Poor's, in a report, referring to General Motors, Ford and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler.
11/12/2003	More Big 3 Cars to China	General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler said yesterday that they had reached agreements with China to import more cars and trucks built in the United States.
11/10/2003	Champions Among the Mustang Herd	THE most desirable Mustangs are the high-performance editions built by Carroll Shelby, the legendary race-car driver. The rarest of the Shelby Mustangs command six-figure prices, but the standard production Mustangs are easier to drive and easier on the wallet. Mustang experts say buyers should look for rust damage, particularly on the early models. Damp carpeting may be the first indication that restoration of the cowl or floor will be needed. Also, cars that have been modified from original condition bring lower prices. The following values are for cars in average to high (excellent overall) condition, as listed in the appraisal guide of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
11/10/2003	AUTOS ON MONDAY/Collecting; Back in 1964, First Pony Out of the Gate	THE frenzy among car buyers set off by the April 1964 introduction of the Ford Mustang nearly equaled the reaction of music fans to the Beatles' first appearance on television's ''Ed Sullivan Show,'' just two months earlier. By the end of the 1965 model year, 17 months later, more than 680,000 Mustangs had been sold, a record for Ford. In fact, the arrival of Ford's sporty coupe and convertible (and the competitors it inspired) created a new market category and inspired its name: the ''pony'' car.
11/4/2003	World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Auto Workers Contract	Metalworkers at the Ford Motor Company and Mercedes Benz voted to end a strike that for five days has cut Brazil's auto production by as much as a third, but strikers at Volkswagen refused to return to work until they received a better pay offer. Jos Lopez Feijo, leader of the ABC Metalworkers' Union, which called the strike in S?o Paulo last Tuesday, said workers at Ford and Mercedes voted to accept an offer made late Friday. General Motors had avoided a strike with a negotiated agreement. He did not disclose details of the new offers. Tony Smith (NYT)
11/4/2003	Sales Fell in October for G.M. and Ford	Reporting one of the domestic automobile industry's toughest months yet this year, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company said on Monday that sales fell in October from the month last year. G.M. said its sales dropped 7 percent in October, while Ford said sales fell 2 percent. Among the Big Three, only the Chrysler Corporation, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, reported a gain over last year, rising 11 percent to let it remain in third place ahead of the Toyota Motor Company of Japan, which said sales rose 11.7 percent in October.
11/4/2003	A Las Vegas theme for some blue-chip names.	DECADES after Elvis Presley warbled ''Viva Las Vegas,'' marketers, agencies and media companies are lustily joining the chorus, flooding the commercial culture with images of gambling and Las Vegas to woo consumers. The allure of slots, showgirls, roulette and raffish Rat Packers is being invoked by blue-chip companies like Delta Air Lines, DreamWorks, Ford Motor, the NBC division of General Electric, Levi Strauss, PepsiCo and Time Warner. They join brands that one might assume would be ardent fans of Las Vegas lifestyles like, well, the LifeStyles line of condoms sold by the Ansell Healthcare division of Pacific Dunlop.
10/31/2003	The Hot Seat (Or the Cool)	The days are gone when leather car seats automatically chilled you to the tailbone on winter mornings and burned your shorts-clad legs in summer. Car seats with heating elements have been around for years. Many seats now also have fans that push room-temperature air through their perforated leather covers. But in front seats offered with some Ford, Mercury and Lincoln models, the air blown through the seat covering is cooled on hot days by the same device that heats that air on cold days. Novel, yes, but based on a discovery made more than a century and a half ago. What the French scientist Jean Peltier found back in 1834 was that a junction of dissimilar metals could heat or cool, depending on the direction of an electric current passing through it. In the new seats, a small thermoelectric device uses the Peltier effect to heat or cool; a fan then pushes the air through perforations in the seat and backrest. A microprocessor, linked to the vehicle's climate-control system, controls the amount and direction of the current through the device.
10/30/2003	Metalworkers Stage Strike At Carmakers In Brazil	Although their industry is facing its worst crisis in years, thousands of metalworkers in Brazil's industrial heartland downed tools on Wednesday, halting about one-third of the country's auto and truck production at plants belonging to Ford Motor, Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Scania. According to the ABC Metalworkers Union, once led by President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, about 24,000 workers -- three-quarters of the auto production work force in factories in S?o Paulo's industrial belt -- were on strike after rejecting a raise of nearly 16 percent, four percentage points less than what the unions had asked for.
10/29/2003	Car Sticker Prices Mask Some Big Bargains	There is an adage in the auto industry that says if you want the best deal on a car, you wait until the last month of the model year. But last month, the end of the 2003 model year, there were bargains beyond belief. In September, the average car buyer went home with record discounts of more than $5,000 off the sticker price of a 2003 model vehicle, according to figures to be released Wednesday by Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers buying advice to consumers.
10/28/2003	Ford Giving New Thought to Its Plan to Discontinue an S.U.V.	The Ford Motor Company is rethinking its decision to stop making the Excursion, a large sport utility vehicle that has been a favorite target of criticism by environmental advocates. The company had decided last year to stop selling the Excursion after the 2004 model year because of declining sales, but said on Monday that it was reconsidering because industry demand had held up for the largest S.U.V.'s.
10/25/2003	FORD AND FIRESTONE SETTLE 90 SUITS IN ROLLOVER CASES	Ford Motor and Bridgestone's Firestone unit said yesterday that they had settled 90 lawsuits over rollovers of Ford Explorers in Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia. Terms were not disclosed. The agreements lift the threat of large verdicts in the cases, filed in United States courts after the recall in 2000 and 2001 of 10 million Firestone tires made for the Explorer. The cases were consolidated in United States District Court in Indianapolis to streamline proceedings. Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tire said it had resolved 1,300 cases since the tire recall; Ford has settled hundreds of rollover suits.
10/25/2003	New Luxury-Car Specifications: Styling. Performance. Aroma.	For Cadillac, the new-car smell, that ethereal scent of factory freshness, is no longer just a product of chance. General Motors recently revealed that its Cadillac division had engineered a scent for its vehicles and had been processing it into the leather seats. The scent -- sort of sweet, sort of subliminal -- was created in a lab, was picked by focus groups and is now the aroma of every new Cadillac put on the road.
10/22/2003	The Motor City And California: Is It Splitsville?	CALIFORNIA and the Motor City used to be the perfect couple. With its freeways and easygoing, put-the-top-down mentality, the Golden State was the car state of the nation -- and the car was most definitely made in America. Can you imagine the Beach Boys singing about imports? (''And she'll have fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the Honda Civic away.'') Or try to envision Hollywood icons of days gone by -- McQueen and the Rat Pack -- in anything but the likes of Fords, Lincolns or Chevys? Of course not. But the freeways got clogged, American cars lost their ring-a-ding-ding and the romance soured. California remains the car state, but about the only new domestic sedans you see on the roads now are from the rental car lots of Avis, Hertz and Budget.
10/22/2003	Some Green Machines Swim in the Mainstream	LAWRENCE ANG never intended to be environmentally correct. He wanted a new car with an economical price tag, good gas mileage and looks he liked. By choosing a Ford Focus, he also got a car with tailpipe emissions so low they are often cleaner than the ambient air in smoggy urban areas. ''To be honest, I never considered the low emissions, and didn't really find out about it until after I bought it,'' said Mr. Ang, 36, a computer technician who lives here. ''But it never hurts. I'm hoping it means I will have years of no trouble with smog tests.''
10/22/2003	STANDARD & POOR'S MAY CUT FORD'S DEBT RATINGS	The Ford Motor Company's debt ratings may be cut to the lowest investment grade by Standard & Poor's, which said yesterday that the company's automotive operations faced intensifying competition. Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., reported a third-quarter net loss of $25 million last week, and most of the profit it has posted for the year has come from its consumer credit unit, Ford Motor Credit. The company was ''disappointed'' with S.& P.'s decision to put its ratings under review for a possible downgrading, the chief financial officer, Donat R. Leclair, said in a statement. Ford's long-term debt is currently rated BBB, two steps above noninvestment grade.
10/20/2003	Ford Seeks Reductions In Cost of Commercials	The Ford Motor Company is asking companies that specialize in producing automotive commercials to reduce profit margins to work on Ford assignments. The requests by Ford for rollbacks on the profit margins, known as markups, are part of efforts to cut costs as Ford struggles with sluggish sales. Ford is seeking rollbacks of up to half on markups, which would reduce the average markup on production of a commercial to a range of 14 percent to 15 percent.
10/17/2003	Ford Reports Narrower Loss For the Quarter	Buoyed by its financial operations and cost-cutting, the Ford Motor Company said Thursday that it had narrowed its loss and handily beat Wall Street estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The company raised its operating earnings goal for the full year, from 70 cents a share to 95 cents to $1.05 a share.
10/14/2003	World Briefing | Asia: Thailand: Ford Expanding Venture	The Ford Motor Company said that it and its affiliate Mazda Motor would invest 21 billion baht ($533 million) in their Thai manufacturing joint venture, AutoAlliance Thailand, to expand its production capacity to 200,000 units annually from 135,000. The eight-year-old Thai factory produces pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles for sale in Thailand and for export to more than 130 countries, Ford said. Thailand, it said, has become the second-largest market for pickup trucks outside the United States. Wayne Arnold (NYT)
10/14/2003	Technology Briefing | Software: Electronic Data To Sell Part Of Software Unit	The Electronic Data Systems Corporation said yesterday that it might sell part of a unit that makes software that General Motors and Ford Motor use to design, build and deliver cars. A public share sale or minority investor may be sought for the PLM Solutions unit, Electronic Data said in a statement. PLM, whose name stands for product life-cycle management, employs 5,000 people. Electronic Data is selling some operations to raise cash and focus on its main business of managing computer systems for other businesses. PLM's second-quarter sales fell 10 percent, to $205 million, while companywide revenue rose 2.4 percent to $5.52 billion with help from the dollar's falling value. Electronic Data, based in Plano, Tex., said in June that it would eliminate 2,700 jobs and sell some businesses to trim $5.83 billion in long-term debt. Shares of Electronic Data rose 28 cents, to $21.84.
10/12/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Ford F-150; A Strong New Truck: Is It Brawny Enough To Carry a Company?	UNLESS you have been living in a cave for 26 years, you've probably heard that the Ford F-Series is the world's most popular line of pickups, having outsold all other trucks since 1978. And you may know the more wondrous fact that for two decades the F-Series has outsold every other vehicle, car or truck, in the United States. The mainstay of this truck line is the F-150, which comprises a range of versatile full-size pickups that work in countless occupations, that play in all sorts of recreational arenas and that increasingly serve as family cars.
10/11/2003	COLLINS & AIKMAN TO MAKE COMPONENTS FOR FORD FUTURA	The Collins & Aikman Corporation said it was selected by Ford Motor to provide interior systems for the Futura sedan. Collins & Aikman will be responsible for designing and making instrument panels, front- and rear-door panels and other interior components, the company said. Revenue from the contract ''will exceed several billion dollars over the life of the program,'' a spokesman, David Youngman, said. Ford will start producing the Futura, which will be its primary midsize car, in 2005. Stock in Collins & Aikman, which is based in Troy, Mich., rose 34 cents, or 12 percent, to $3.09 a share.
10/2/2003	Buyers Cash In on Offers to Keep Car Sales Strong	September auto sales slowed from August but continued to show strength, surprising analysts. Customers took advantage of the latest price war. Last month, General Motors was giving away Dell computers to Saturn buyers, in addition to the usual offer of zero-percent financing and big rebates that were heaviest on remaining 2003 models.
10/1/2003	U.S. Trading Of Emissions Starts Slowly	The Chicago Climate Exchange, a start-up venture hoping to create a market for member companies and governments to trade rights to emit gases associated with global warming, got off to an ambiguous start yesterday with an auction that laid the groundwork for trading to begin Oct. 31. The prices paid by companies like Ford Motor, DuPont and American Electric Power for carbon dioxide emissions averaged less than $1 a metric ton. That was one-tenth the price of over-the-counter trades of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in Europe.
9/28/2003	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Ford Freestar; The Minivan Formerly Known as Windstar	WHEN Prince changed his name to a symbol, in the process earning the not-so-graceful sobriquet of Artist Formerly Known as Prince, his appearance and his music didn't change significantly, but for a time he had everyone talking. That may be Ford's hope for its Windstar minivan, which for 2004 shows up wearing a tag that says, ''Hello, my name is Freestar.'' Although the latest Ford van -- and a new version to be sold by Mercury dealers -- is indisputably improved, the Freestar is still, in all but its name, the Windstar.
9/28/2003	Business People; American Idols Switch To a New Model	Ruben Studdard, this year's ''American Idol'' winner, and Clay Aiken, the runner-up, electrified the audience at Toyota's annual dealer meeting, serving as the opening act for Elton John, according to a report in Newsweek last week. The only thing is, the sponsor of ''American Idol'' is the Ford Motor Company. Ford also provided vehicles for skits on the show that feature the contestants, including Mr. Studdard and Mr. Aiken.
9/28/2003	The Coolest Car in L.A.	Every minute of every day in Los Angeles, there is a contest among cars: which is coolest? There are many standards -- kids love souped-up trucks, and boomers obsess over hot rods -- but among aficionados, the ever-shifting hierarchy currently stacks up this way: old over new, domestic over foreign and cool over cost. Based on these criteria, American-made midcentury muscle cars are the most coveted. They have the solid but curvy frames from Motown's golden age of design. They have engines too big for their bodies. They have big wheels ready to squeal on drag strips.
9/28/2003	The Pickup, A Love Story	The bed of a full-size pickup truck stretches as much as 8 feet long and 5 1/2 feet wide. It can carry 2,500 pounds, give or take, as well as tow something a good deal heavier, like a boat. But that's not why Shannen Doherty drives one. As useful as the bed of a pickup is, for most drivers these days the receptacle over their right shoulders remains untapped potential, a Void filled only by duffel bags and the occasional bag of manure. What's more, the cab of the Platonic pickup -- its single bench seat, more precisely -- is entirely impractical if you wish to travel with company beyond your dog or your best girl. But that's the point: alone, but not lonely, the wellspring of a pickup's iconic appeal in America. The man (and increasingly, the woman) behind the wheel of a pickup is the automotive equivalent of the lone rider loping off into the horizon. It was, after all, for the pickup that the gun rack was invented.
9/28/2003	To Complete the Pregnancy Experience, Just Add Some Pickles and Ice Cream	AT 48, with two children in secondary school, my childbearing years are, happily, over. Yet during a recent visit to Ford Division headquarters here, memories of pregnancy came awkwardly flooding back: the bloated midsection, the aching back, the clumsy gait. Who got me in this fix?
9/26/2003	Automakers Sue Over Asbestos Maneuver	The three largest United States automakers have sued to block Honeywell International Inc. from transferring its Bendix brake unit to the bankrupt Federal-Mogul Corporation, contending the transaction would unfairly saddle the car companies with increased asbestos liabilities. Honeywell seeks to use the transaction to extricate itself from more than 50,000 asbestos lawsuits against Bendix. Federal-Mogul filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2001 to resolve about 360,000 asbestos suits and future claims by establishing a trust to pay victims. Claims against Bendix would be channeled into the trust, possibly freeing Honeywell from liability.
9/24/2003	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Ford Expanding	Ford Motor said yesterday that it would expand its factory to triple production to 150,000 vehicles a year. Ford's factory in Chongqing in Southwestern China was intended to make as many as 50,000 Mondeo and Fiesta cars a year when production began in January. ''The market here is expanding incredibly fast, so we need to bring in as many products as soon as we can to take advantage of the growth,'' said Dale Jones, Ford Motor China's marketing vice president.
9/23/2003	Auto Deal or Bust	Last week, the United Automobile Workers offered more concessions to the Big Three than it has in the last two decades of contract talks. Then again, concessions have not really been a feature of the last two decades of contract talks in the American auto industry. While auto workers see a contract that extends a lifeline to the struggling Big Three, Wall Street sees baby steps that amount to a glass half-full in some minds and fully empty in others.
9/21/2003	Business People; Couture Update: 3 Deals, 3 Looks For U.A.W.'s Chief	Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers, made an industrial fashion statement last week: he donned buttoned-down shirts with the union's logo to announce deals with Detroit's Big Three. At Chrysler, Mr. Gettelfinger wore blue, collar and all. At Ford, however, he showed up in a flattering camel-colored shirt that complemented the brown double-breasted suit coat and tie worn by the company's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr. To reach a deal with General Motors, Mr. Gettelfinger chose blue-and-white stripes, which nicely set off his bright white mustache.
9/19/2003	G.M. Accord Finishes Talks For U.A.W.	The United Automobile Workers union concluded its contract negotiations with the Big Three and two major suppliers today after granting its most significant concessions in two decades. The deals, which will result in thousands of job cuts as roughly a dozen plants are closed or sold, reflect the broad competitive struggles of domestic manufacturers, and the union's effort to balance the desires of its members with the shrinking market share and profits of the automakers.
9/17/2003	Tough Times Force U.A.W. To Employ New Strategy	The nearly simultaneous deals the United Automobile Workers union announced Monday with the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group represent a sharp break with tradition and underscore how tough times are for the Big Three and their suppliers. Terms of the four-year labor contracts keep the union workers' generous health care benefits largely intact, but the union gave ground on other important issues, including scaling back wage increases and selectively lifting a ban on plant closings, according to people with knowledge of the deals.
9/16/2003	Labor Pacts Reached at Ford and Chrysler	The Ford Motor Company and the auto parts giant Visteon said late this evening that they had reached tentative agreement on four-year labor contracts with the United Automobile Workers union. The Ford deal was the second announced today between the union and a Big Three automaker, an unusually swift resolution to the talks that reflects union leaders' realization of the competitive difficulties faced by the Big Three, whose domestic market share fell to a record monthly low in August.
9/12/2003	Big 3 and Union Said to Be Near One Deal for All	The Big Three and the United Automobile Workers are on the brink of an unprecedented early and simultaneous resolution to their contract talks, people close to the negotiations said. The parties are looking to wrap up negotiations before midnight Sunday, when the four-year labor contracts expire. Reaching an accord at all three companies would be a historic sign of unity between the union and management, but time is running short and hiccups have a way of derailing negotiations.
9/8/2003	Chrysler and G.M. Resume Union Talks	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, which has told its union that it may need additional job cuts to stem losses, and General Motors resumed labor negotiations yesterday on a new contract. Ford Motor took the day off. Negotiations between the companies and the United Auto Workers recessed Saturday night after around-the-clock talks since Sept. 3.
9/7/2003	Business People; Well, Cars Have CD Players	The Borders Group's newest executive has the book world a little puzzled. Late last month, Borders appointed Peter Faricy as vice president for multimedia marketing, in charge of its DVD and music sales. Mr. Faricy joined Borders from the Ford Motor Company, where he most recently was regional operations manager for the Lincoln-Mercury division in Detroit and served as director of business development for North America.
9/4/2003	With a Torrid Month, Toyota Moves Ahead of Chrysler in Sales	The day that the American automobile industry has been dreading for years arrived today. Toyota outsold Chrysler in August, the first time one of Detroit's Big Three has fallen to fourth place. Toyota's accomplishment capped the hottest month of the year thus far for the industry, though overall sales dropped about 1 percent from August 2002, the best month last year, according to figures from Ward's Automotive Reports. Foreign car makers smashed sales records last month, but General Motors' sales were virtually unchanged from August 2002; Chrysler fell 6 percent and sales at Ford Motor plunged 13 percent from last year.
8/31/2003	British Invasion at Ford	William Clay Ford Jr., the chief executive of Ford Motor, likes to say that he bleeds ''Ford blue,'' the color of the company's famous oval logo and his family's Detroit Lions football team. But many of his top executives are partial to the red, white and blue -- of the Union Jack, that is. Last week, Ford chose Lewis Booth as the new president of Ford of Europe, giving yet another important position to a British native. Mr. Booth, born in Liverpool, England, was previously in charge of the Japanese automaker Mazda, over which Ford has management control. He replaced Martin Leach, born in Billericay, England, who left Ford Europe two weeks ago.
8/31/2003	The Sun Rises at Mazda	Mr. Booth's promotion at Ford of Europe prompted a sense of pride back in Japan. The reason is that Mazda now has its first Japanese chief executive since Ford took a controlling interest in the company in 1996. The job went to Hisakazu Imaki, who has been with Mazda since 1965. He is best known for his manufacturing expertise, which has helped Mazda become one of the world's most flexible automobile manufacturers. Under the guidance of Mr. Imaki, Mazda figured out how to build both its own vehicles and those designed by Ford, on the same assembly line.
8/29/2003	$100 million to keep a hugely popular pickup hugely popular.	FEW products are as vital to a company as the F-Series pickup is to the Ford Motor Company. Today, Ford begins an advertising blitz surrounding its completely redesigned F-150, the truck that makes up the bulk of F-Series sales. The aim is for the F-150, which is more than a half-century old, to appeal to a range of buyers, some seeking a no-frills work truck, others wanting a high-end luxury family hauler.
8/28/2003	Ford Is Predicting a Profit in Europe	The Ford Motor Company, which named a chief of European operations Tuesday, said today that it expected the division to return to showing a profit in the fourth quarter. ''I would be disappointed if we don't return to profitability in the fourth quarter,'' said David Thursfield, Ford's executive vice president for international operations and global purchasing, in a conference call this morning. ''We will make Europe profitable, and it will contribute to the corporate well-being.''
8/27/2003	Mazda's President Is Chosen to Run Ford in Europe	The Ford Motor Company said tonight that it had named Lewis Booth, Mazda's chief executive, to run Ford's struggling European division. Mr. Booth, 54, succeeds Martin Leach, who resigned earlier this month and is said to be in talks to take the top job at Fiat Auto, the Italian automaker.
8/27/2003	Car Sales Slow Despite Spending on Incentives	In another sign of how competitive the car market has become, auto companies spent a record amount on incentives in July, yet their vehicles sat unsold on dealers' lots for a record length of time. Moreover, Ford Motor and the Chrysler Corporation lost market share in July, though the average incentives for Detroit's auto companies grew to the highest level ever, according to Edmunds.com, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that offers consumers buying advice and tracks industry trends.
8/24/2003	On the Way: A Bumper Crop	AMERICANS bought 38,000 gas-electric hybrid vehicles last year, and sales are likely to reach 54,000 in 2003, according to a recent study by J.D. Power & Associates, the big market-research firm. That is only the beginning, if J.D. Power's predictions pan out: the firm expects 500,000 annual hybrid sales by 2008 and 872,000 by 2013. Since only three hybrid cars are currently available, reaching those lofty figures will require new varieties of hybrids -- and they are certainly on the way.
8/19/2003	Ford Plant Finds Efficiency Is No Protector	The Ford Motor Company's assembly plant near Atlanta is one of the most productive car factories on the continent, but a top union official there said today that its future was in doubt. Ford told union workers at a meeting in June that no new product is scheduled for the plant in the Atlanta suburb of Hapeville, which employs 2,300 hourly workers and produces the aging Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans, according to Mitchell Smith, the top United Automobile Workers official at the plant.
8/13/2003	President of Ford of Europe Steps Down Amid Losses	Amid a faltering performance, the Ford Motor Company said today that the president of its European division was leaving the company. Martin R. Leach, the president and chief operating officer of Ford of Europe for about a year, ''has elected to leave the company to pursue new opportunities,'' the company said in a news release.
8/11/2003	MediaTalk; After Bashing Cars, Mother Jones Will Help Sell One	Twenty-six years ago, Mother Jones, a bimonthly magazine known for its investigative journalism and liberal politics, published a cover story about the tendency of the Pinto, the compact car made by Ford, to occasionally explode after it was rear-ended in an accident. ''Are You Driving the Deadliest Car in America?'' asked the pointed headline, directing readers to internal company documents the magazine had obtained. The documents showed that Ford knew that when the car was hit from behind, the frame was pushed into the gasoline tank.
8/9/2003	Big Recall Issued For Ford S.U.V.'s	The Ford Motor Company, the world's second-largest automaker by sales, yesterday recalled more than 1.68 million sport utility vehicles, including its top-selling Explorer, to fix speed-control cables and seat-frame bolts. The recalled models include Explorer, Explorer Sport, Explorer Sport Trac and Mercury Mountaineer from 1998 through 2002 because a driver-seat bolt may fracture, causing the seat to recline unexpectedly, Ford said. They also include 499,988 of the same models from 1999 through 2001 because speed-control cables may wear out early and fail to disengage.
8/8/2003	Chevrolet Aims to Take Lead From Ford With Nine New Models	The Chevrolet division of General Motors plans to introduce nine new models over 20 months, starting in January, setting up a battle to overtake the Ford brand as the nation's top seller. ''This product barrage should help get Chevy back to selling three million cars and trucks a year,'' said Gary L. Cowger, president of G.M.'s North American operations.
8/2/2003	Vehicle Sales Dipped in July For Big Three	American consumers gave the auto industry its best month of the year in July. Unfortunately for Detroit, they did so by buying vehicles with foreign nameplates. General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler all said today that their sales of cars and trucks fell last month, even though the companies are collectively offering the biggest incentives ever.
8/1/2003	FINANCE UNIT OF FORD NAMES A NEW CHIEF OF OPERATIONS	The Ford Motor Credit Company, the finance unit of the automaker, promoted Michael Bannister to president and chief operating officer yesterday. Mr. Bannister was president of Ford Credit International, which handles the finance business in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Mr. Bannister will take the president post from Greg Smith, the chairman and chief executive of Ford Credit. The chief operating officer position was vacant. Ford Credit produced $401 million of Ford Motor's $417 million in second-quarter earnings.
7/25/2003	FORD TO USE LOW FINANCING AS DRAW FOR F-150 PICKUP	The Ford Motor Company will offer financing on its redesigned F-150 pickup truck at rates as low as 2.9 percent but will not offer rebates in a bet that buyers will want a truck with a larger interior and a more powerful engine. The 2.9 percent rate applies to 36-month loans, with 3.9 percent for 48 months and 4.9 percent for 60 months on the 2004 model, said Jim Cain, a Ford spokesman. The rates expire Sept. 2. Competition from General Motors and others may force Ford to raise incentives for the F-150, said Erich Merkle, an analyst at the consulting firm IRN.
7/19/2003	Ford S.U.V.'s Use More Gas Than Before	The average fuel economy of the Ford Motor Company's sport utility vehicles will be worse for the 2003 model year than the previous year, the company said in a report issued on Thursday. Earlier this year, the company said it could not meet a pledge to raise the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent from 2000 to 2005. But the report indicates that Ford is actually moving backward on fuel economy in its sport utility vehicles.
7/18/2003	World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Vehicle Output Increased	Bucking a gloomy trend in Brazil's auto industry, the Ford Motor Company has increased production at its plant in the state of Bahia to meet rising demand across Latin America for its new sport utility vehicle, the EcoSport. The factory at Camacari, which builds the vehicle for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico, increased output more than 18 percent in June. Tony Smith (NYT)
7/17/2003	Ford Reports 27% Drop In 2nd-Quarter Earnings	The Ford Motor Company's earnings fell nearly 27 percent in the second quarter, and the company said today that it expected profits to be flat for the second half of the year. The declining profits reflected sluggish vehicle sales in the critical North American market, where Ford's market share is also declining, and prices that continue to fall if one factors in the rising costs of incentives like rebates and interest-free financing.
7/17/2003	Madonna and Magic To Pitch Products	Two big marketers have hired celebrities to endorse their products for undisclosed terms. Gap Inc. signed an agreement with Madonna for her to appear in an ad campaign for the Gap retail chain this fall. Claudia Hawkins, a spokeswoman at Gap in San Francisco, confirmed reports of the move, but declined to provide details.
7/15/2003	Their Health Costs Soaring, Automakers Are to Begin Labor Talks	The Big Three automakers, which open contract talks with the United Auto Workers union on Wednesday, are making a bigger issue out of reducing medical costs than they have in years. But the union has staked out health insurance as untouchable. ''We're not going to share costs,'' said Ron Gettelfinger, the U.A.W. president, at a recent news briefing.
7/13/2003	Private Sector; The Glamour Follows Gilmour Out the Door	As far as Allan D. Gilmour is concerned, the era of the celebrity C.F.O. is over. Mr. Gilmour, 69, gave up the chief financial officer's post last week at the Ford Motor Company to Don R. Leclair, 51, who was the controller. Mr. Gilmour came out of retirement last year as a favor to Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr. and remains as vice chairman, overseeing Mr. Leclair.
7/11/2003	Ford Names a Finance Chief From Its Ranks	The Ford Motor Company said today it had named a veteran company executive, Don R. Leclair, as its chief financial officer, after ending a much-publicized search to recruit an outside candidate. Mr. Leclair, 51, is Ford's fifth finance chief in the past four years, a period of financial turmoil for the company. Ford, the world's second-largest auto company, has begun a revitalization plan and expects to be profitable this year, but some analysts believe the company has moved too slowly in the face of increased industry competition.
7/9/2003	American Cars Show Gains In a Survey of Dependability	Mercedes-Benz has fallen behind its sister brand Chrysler in a closely watched report on vehicle dependability, while General Motors has surged. And Japanese vehicles continue, over all, to hold up the best. The report, issued today by J. D. Power & Associates, focuses on problems that arise over three years of ownership. Its rankings are important because most consumers say a vehicle's reputation for long-term durability is their top consideration in buying.
7/2/2003	4% Rise in Auto Sales in June Fuels Optimism at the Big Three	Nationwide auto sales rose in June, but the domestic industry continued to lose ground to foreign competitors like Toyota despite spending heavily on consumer purchase incentives. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company were upbeat in conference calls today, though, saying that they saw positive signs for industry sales in the second half of the year.
7/2/2003	Employers Seek To Shift Costs Of Drugs to U.S.	The bills to provide drug benefits through Medicare that were passed by the House and the Senate last week offer some of the country's largest employers a long-sought prize: shifting at least some of their burden of soaring drug costs to the federal government. With billions of dollars at stake, those companies are lobbying hard to make sure that those gains survive in the final version of the law.
6/22/2003	The High Life Is Winding Down for Jaguar Mechanics	IF you are an import-car enthusiast of a certain age, you remember the jokes: if you want to drive a Jaguar, buy two -- one of them will always be in the shop. After Ford bought Jaguar in 1989, it made reliability a top priority. Joe Ivers, executive director of quality and customer satisfaction for J. D. Power & Associates, the market research firm, noticed the change. ''Throughout the 90's Jaguar had what I would characterize as a very athletic, consistent and dramatic improvement in initial quality,'' Mr. Ivers said. And when the Power survey checked Jaguars as they aged, they became increasingly reliable.
6/20/2003	Carmakers Around World Are Turning to India for Parts	The scramble by the recession-wounded global automotive industry to find a source for low-cost, high-quality components has been a big boon to India's auto parts makers. Among the rash of announcements just this month was one by the Delphi Corporation, the world's largest automotive parts maker, saying that it would have $140 million worth of auto parts -- forged engine parts, intricate plastic moldings and other products -- made by Indian concerns, and that such orders were expected to exceed $250 million a year by 2007. The Ford Motor Company said that it expected to get more than $100 million worth of components from Indian parts makers in the next two years. Volvo said that it planned to increase its manufacturing in India to 100 million euros ($117 million) worth of parts in one year instead of three.
6/19/2003	U.S. Automakers Improve Efficiency, But Some Troubling Figures Remain	With every piece of good news about the Big Three comes another reminder of how wide the competitive gap with Japan remains. Today, a report on manufacturing efficiency in North American auto plants last year showed encouraging results for American automakers. General Motors continued to make impressive strides toward closing the productivity gap with Japanese automakers. And the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler, the least productive of the six largest automakers in North America, had the industry's best year-over-year improvement in 2002.
6/18/2003	Employers Plan Obesity Fight, Citing $12-Billion-a-Year Cost	A group of large employers headed by Ford Motor, Honeywell, General Mills and PepsiCo announced a campaign yesterday to encourage overweight workers to slim down as a way to improve both their personal health and the corporate bottom line. Dr. Vince Kerr, director of health care management at Ford, said weight-related costs were adding $12 billion a year to costs of employers nationwide, including medical bills, reduced productivity, increased absenteeism and higher health and disability insurance premiums.
6/15/2003	A Family's 100-Year Car Trip	TALK about an interesting family reunion. This weekend, about 80 members of the Ford clan are converging here for the Ford Motor Company's centennial. The party, part public, part private, features music -- Beyonc Knowles, Toby Keith and Harry Connick Jr. are among the performers -- vintage Fords and a caravan of about three dozen original Model T's that have traversed America's back roads from California to Michigan for the celebration. And, as at most family get-togethers, pictures will be snapped, including what will be the largest Ford family photograph ever taken.
6/13/2003	On Ford's 100th Birthday, Fixation on Its Brand Runs Deep	IT was not possible to keep the actual letter from Henry Ford, but the story of how it came to John Russell Little in 1934 lives on, and because of it, members of the Little family have spent decades riding in Fords. In 1933, Mr. Little bought his first Ford V-8 from Tupper Motors in La Canada, Calif. He was not happy with it, his son, Charles E. Little, said in an interview a few weeks ago. The car's valves clattered, the pistons knocked and it ate oil. After a frustrating year, Mr. Little decided to write directly to the founder of the company, Henry Ford himself, and tell him that the V-8 engine was the worst pile of junk he had ever seen.
5/21/2003	FORD TO USE CUTS TO OFFSET COSTS OF INCENTIVES	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would hasten cost cuts this year because it could not raise prices enough on most models to offset the effect of rebates and low-interest loans. Competition on incentives ''is even more intense'' than expected, the chief operating officer, Nick Scheele, told analysts. The chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., said reducing costs was ''one lever we can continue to pull to guide our way through this.'' Ford, which had losses totaling $6.43 billion in 2001 and 2002, is accelerating expense reductions because Mr. Ford has vowed not to match discounts by General Motors. Ford has already exceeded a 2003 cost-cutting target of $500 million announced earlier this year, executives have said.
5/20/2003	Court to Decide if Constitution May Sometimes Require Taxpayer Subsidies to Religion	Barely a year after ruling that the Constitution does not ban the use of taxpayer money for religious school tuition, the Supreme Court today agreed to take the next step and decide whether a public subsidy for religious instruction may under some circumstances be constitutionally required. This potentially explosive issue reached the court in an appeal by the State of Washington, which like many other states has a provision in its Constitution that prohibits the use of public money for religious instruction. The state turned down an application for a scholarship from an otherwise eligible student who sought a theology degree at a private Christian college.
5/20/2003	HONDA UNIT WILL STOP LEASING VEHICLES IN 3 STATES	The Honda Motor Company's finance unit said yesterday that it would stop leasing vehicles to residents of New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island in July because of laws that leave leasing companies accountable in traffic accidents. Honda's action follows similar moves by the finance units of General Motors and Ford in response to the so-called vicarious liability laws. Such laws allow a leasing company to be held responsible for accidents caused by customers operating leased vehicles. Honda's unit, the American Honda Finance Corporation, based in Torrance, Calif., is offering customers alternatives to leasing a vehicle, including a $1,500 damage waiver on excess wear and use. The New York Legislature is considering changes to the state's leasing law.
5/16/2003	Two-Wheel Drive Meets Four-Wheel Drive	JOEL BRAZY went to a bicycle show and bought a car. Michael Gerold went car shopping and walked out with a bicycle. They were captured, in different deals and separate parts of the country, by a marketing marriage that has been successful at enticing buyers. Great-looking bikes parked in auto showrooms help lure bike-loving customers, often the young, who can then be persuaded to buy cars. And if a customer came in to see the cars, a bike can be an added incentive to buy one. Mr. Brazy, a 43-year-old photographer based in Madison, Wis., was recruiting at a table for the Diabetes Tour de Cure in Madison this spring and got into a conversation with a representative from Don Miller Subaru, a co-sponsor of the event.
5/14/2003	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Sirius Radio To Be Offered In Some Ford Cars	Sirius Satellite Radio Inc., the No. 2 satellite radio broadcaster, said yesterday that the Ford Motor Company would offer Sirius's service in 10 of its 2004 model cars, helping Sirius get more customers. Starting in September, satellite radios will be offered as a dealer option on cars including the Ford Thunderbird, the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercury Mountaineer, Sirius said in a statement. It is the first time the Sirius service will be offered through Ford, although the two companies have had a partnership since 1999, a Ford spokeswoman, Emily Foley, said. Sirius's $12.95-a-month radio service offers 100 channels of programming via satellite. Sirius is counting on Ford to help it sign up the two million subscribers it needs to generate enough revenue to finance its operations and cover debt payments. XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the biggest provider of radio service via satellite, has said it has more than 500,000 subscribers. Sirius shares rose 17 cents, or 16 percent, to $1.23.
5/14/2003	Revamped S.U.V. Found To Cause Worse Injuries	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today that a crash test of the 2003 Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle indicated that it had become more harmful to people riding in passenger cars than the 1999 model. The finding was significant because the Navigator, a large luxury S.U.V., has been marketed by the Ford Motor Company as a vehicle redesigned in ways that made it less dangerous to passenger car occupants in two-vehicle collisions.
5/2/2003	Auto Sales Dropped 6.1% During April	Auto sales for April improved on a sluggish first quarter, receiving a modest bump from a renewed incentive push by the Big Three, but were still below the strong levels of a year ago. ''When one considers the heavy incentives for the month, the sales levels are quite disappointing,'' said Domenic D. Martilotti, an analyst for Bear, Stearns. ''Each iteration of this zero-percent-for-60-months push, there are clearly diminishing returns. So the question is, where do we go from here?''
4/27/2003	Ford at 100: Social Change, Innovations and a Few Stumbles	HENRY FORD changed the world. His Model T put the automobile within reach of the working class. The assembly line and the $5-a-day wage, two other Ford innovations, made the T affordable. ''There were other people who could have done what he did, putting America and the world on wheels,'' said Beverly Rae Kimes, an automotive historian in New York. ''Ransom Olds was there first, but there was not another man who was so single-minded, so blindered'' as Ford was.
4/23/2003	Lawyers Taking Aim at Ford On Veracity of Expert	Questions about the credibility of an expert witness in lawsuits involving rollover accidents are putting the Ford Motor Company on the defensive, as lawyers for accident victims press claims that Ford covered up evidence that its Bronco II sport utility vehicle was dangerous. Last week, the South Carolina Supreme Court said that the estate of a man whose leg was crushed in a 1990 Bronco II rollover, Ray H. Chewning Jr., could seek to reopen a case he lost a decade ago. In its ruling saying there was a basis to reconsider the case, the court cited claims by Mr. Chewning's lawyers that Ford paid the expert witness, David Bickerstaff, a former Ford engineer, to testify falsely on its behalf.
4/19/2003	Cloaked in Green, But Pushing Trucks	As the Ford Motor Company scaled back expectations this week for its first hybrid-powered vehicle and backpedaled on a pledge to improve the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles, Toyota was introducing its latest Prius, which will get about 55 miles a gallon and be the first midsize vehicle with hybrid technology. For environmentalists, the contrasting developments reinforced the sense that only foreign carmakers care about curbing America's swelling appetite for oil. ''The Japanese are where you go if you want good technology, and Detroit is where you go if you don't,'' said Daniel Becker, the top global warming expert at the Sierra Club.
4/18/2003	Ford Backs Off Efficiency Pledge For Its S.U.V.'s	Executives of the Ford Motor Company yesterday backed away from a pledge to increase the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005. Ford made that pledge three years ago, and General Motors and the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler subsequently said they would at least match Ford's improvements. At the time, environmentalists hailed the plan as offering hope that the nation's swelling appetite for gasoline could be curbed.
4/18/2003	A Chameleon Gets Brighter	Color-shifting paint, the car finish that changes color before your eyes, is widening its palette with the paint on the limited-edition 2004 SVT Mustang Cobra. The car goes from green to blue to purple to nearly black, depending on the light and the viewing angle of the beholder. It is on display from today through April 27 at the New York International Auto Show. ''If you open the door, the door could be green, the fender blue, and the roof purple,'' said Alan Eggly, senior color designer for the Ford Motor Company. ''It's a dramatic color change, not a gentle shift.''
4/17/2003	Market Place; Ford's Earnings Double Forecast From Wall Street	The Ford Motor Company's efforts to trim its bloated cost structure and revitalize its operations showed signs of progress yesterday as the company reported first-quarter results that were double Wall Street's expectations. Investors have come to expect disappointment from Ford, whose surprising profit report came a day after General Motors backed away from its 2003 earnings goals and showed diminished profitability in its North American automotive operations.
4/16/2003	With Taurus in Its Last Days, Ford Bets on 3 Cars to Take On Japan	The Ford Motor Company is starting to write the obituary of the Taurus, the last American sedan that credibly competed with Japan. Company executives said yesterday that the Taurus would be phased out in the middle of the decade and that three new vehicles Ford was developing would replace it.
4/15/2003	Navistar and Ford Reach a Settlement	Navistar International, the truckmaker, said today that it had reached an agreement with Ford Motor regarding the cancellation of plans to supply V-6 diesel engines for the company's light trucks. The agreement includes compensation for continued costs at a Huntsville, Ala., factory bought to build the canceled engine, Navistar said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It said the financial terms would not be released. A Navistar spokesman, Roy Wiley, said the compensation would not be material to Navistar's results.
4/2/2003	Detroit on a Mission: No Slip in Auto Sales	Auto sales continued their sluggish pace last month, according to figures released today, prompting the Big Three automakers to broaden their no-interest loan offers. Sales actually fell less than many analysts had expected in March, just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, and cars were still selling at a fairly healthy rate. But automakers are clearly worried enough to offer a new round of deals that General Motors called unprecedented, setting up a test for the industry in April.
3/27/2003	FORD NAMES HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH AMERICA	Ford Motor named Phil Martens to run North American development as part of an effort to cut the time needed to create new models, the company said yesterday. Chris P. Theodore, who had been vice president for North American product development, was named to a new post of vice president for advanced product creation and will deal with design and developing new products. Mr. Martens has reported to Mr. Theodore. They will now report to an executive vice president, James Padilla, who oversees Ford's North American operations, and to a group vice president, Richard Parry-Jones, a spokesman, Ray Day, said.
3/27/2003	Tests Track Accident Damage by S.U.V.'s	Initial results are in from the first tests to determine how vehicles stand up in collisions with sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and the news is not good. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a prominent safety research and testing group financed by auto insurers, is conducting tests that measure how occupants fare when their vehicles are struck in the side by an S.U.V. or pickup. The first tests -- which did not yet include cars but used 11 small sport utility vehicles as crash targets -- projected serious head injuries for either the driver or front passenger and frequently both, unless the vehicle was equipped with side air bags that offered head protection.
3/26/2003	World Business Briefing | The Americas: Brazil: Auto Strike Ends	Workers at a Ford Motor Company plant in the northern Brazilian state of Bahia ended a three-day strike after securing a 13 percent wage increase, narrowing the gap in pay with their counterparts in the south. Ford will raise wages by 8.1 percent and slash payroll deductions for transportation costs by 5 percentage points for workers at the plant, which is in Camacari, outside Salvador. The workers rejected the same offer last week but ratified it yesterday after Ford asked a labor court to mediate, a plant spokesman, Miguel de Oliveira, said.
3/16/2003	Business; Auto Sales Are Down. Punish the Parts Makers.	IN early March, two of the world's biggest automakers Ford Motor and General Motors -- announced that they would cut production in the second quarter as they prepared for a downturn in car sales. G.M. said its cutback could be up to 10.5 percent; Ford released details of its cuts on Thursday, when it forecast reductions of 17 percent. Predictably, the automakers' stocks fell. But auto suppliers suffered with them.
3/14/2003	Atmosphere of Gloom Thickens Around G.M. and Ford	A century ago, American car companies were nearly as plentiful as 1990's Internet start-ups. Now there are just two independents left, General Motors and Ford Motor, and some prominent analysts rate their prospects as not much better than a dot-com's. Without ''a material change'' in the industry's business model, G.M. and Ford face a crisis that ''will involve restructuring, consolidation, or possibly even mergers with other partners,'' said John Casesa, auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, in an interview.
3/13/2003	Ford Motor President Denies Report of Feud	Nearly a year and a half into the tenure of William Clay Ford Jr., Ford Motor still finds its management team coalescing, or trying to. But, as Nicholas V. Scheele, the company's president and chief operating officer, found out this week, maintaining a united front is hard to do in the face of rumors that top executives are feuding.
3/12/2003	Ford Decides to Cancel Arrangement With Ad Agency	The Ford Motor Company canceled a new arrangement today with its primary advertising firm, the WPP Group, after an internal review of the deal. Though Ford is already the largest client of WPP, the world's largest agency company, the new arrangement would have made some of the business closed to outside competition in exchange for more competitive rates. Nicholas V. Scheele, the president and chief operating officer of Ford, had informed marketing and sales executives of the deal in a February memo.
3/11/2003	Advertising Decision at Ford Faces Review	The Ford Motor Company is reviewing a decision by its chief operating officer, Nicholas V. Scheele, to further consolidate its advertising business with the London-based WPP Group, Ford confirmed today. Various units of WPP, the world's largest agency company, have handled most of Ford's business for years, some long before they were part of WPP. But Mr. Scheele sent a memorandum to sales and marketing executives in February that said the ties between the companies would become closer.
3/6/2003	California Offers Change In Car Rules	California is seeking to compromise with automakers by dropping a requirement that they sell electric cars, the state's latest attempt to persuade carmakers to end their opposition to the program. The California Air Resources Board outlined proposed changes to the zero-emission vehicle program today that would let companies sell more gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell autos instead of battery-powered cars starting with 2005 models, a spokesman, Dimitri Stanich, said.
2/28/2003	Overhead Organization	New features often mean new clutter, and interior designers have developed a habit of lining the ceilings of trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans with arrays of overhead switches, lights and containers. Now Ford is introducing a touch of organization with a modular interior roof storage system available on its 2004 F-150 pickup, due out this summer. The system starts with four parallel aluminum rails mounted to the roof liner. These accommodate a series of snap-in brushed-aluminum modules that can be rearranged or changed at will. The modules fit to the rails, which act as trim edges as well as mounting points.
2/16/2003	Recycling Fashions at 3,000 r.p.m.	AFTER renting both a Hyundai Sonata and a Ford Mustang, Matt Murray made a pronouncement that would have been unthinkable a decade ago: he preferred the unpretentious Hyundai sedan. That might not have been surprising if he were a middle-aged family man, but Mr. Murray, a ''Saturday Night Live'' writer who lives in Manhattan, is 25 and single. Mr. Murray complained about ergonomic challenges and ''weird blind spots'' in the Mustang, an icon of coolness for an older generation, but the Sonata appealed to his sense of style. ''It was just a normal car,'' he said. ''It was comfortable inside. I did think it was pretty stylish.''
2/14/2003	Ford Said to Be Selling His Goldman Stake	William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, will sell the 400,000 shares of the Goldman Sachs Group that he bought in an initial public offering and donate the profits to charity, a person close to Mr. Ford said yesterday. The decision is a move to quell what had become a nagging ethical distraction. The decision comes a day after a committee of independent company directors said Mr. Ford was under no obligation to sell the shares. The value of his Goldman Sachs stake reached a high of $52 million and is now $26 million, which makes for a paper profit of $4.7 million.
2/4/2003	January Auto Sales Fall 2% As Analysts See Tough Year	Auto sales dropped 2 percent in January from a year earlier, carmakers reported today, signaling what many analysts say will be a tough year for the industry. Consumers are expected to benefit, though, from a wave of new products, particularly from foreign automakers like Nissan Motor, and cheaper prices because of the competition. Ford sales were up 4 percent, while G.M. sales fell 2 percent and Chrysler sales fell 12 percent. Sales were also down sharply from December as Detroit and particularly General Motors stepped back from lavish end-of-the-year incentives.
2/4/2003	Leased-Car Crash Liability Under Review in 3 States	Car companies, auto dealers and banks are putting pressure on New York State legislators to amend a 1929 law that if unchanged could make it difficult for New Yorkers to lease cars. The law allows plaintiffs in car accidents to sue leasing companies for damages, under a legal principle called vicarious liability, because the companies technically own the cars.
1/31/2003	Ford Motor's Future in Brazil Is Now on the Line	At Ford Motor's high-tech factory here, rows of shiny off-road vehicles roll off the production line, swelling the preintroduction stocks of the EcoSport. Smaller and much cheaper than the average sport utility vehicle, the EcoSport is a gamble that the rough roads of Latin America and its consumers' shallow pockets will make the vehicle a success and help Ford South America get back in the black.
1/28/2003	Hybrid Autos Quick to Pass Curiosity Stage	Hybrids, vehicles that save gasoline by combining electric motors with internal combustion engines, are emerging as the first alternative-powered cars to show signs of catching on with automakers and some consumers since the automobile's early days. Toyota and Honda are already selling tens of thousands of hybrids, and General Motors and Ford, worried about ceding another fast-moving market to the Japanese, have announced plans to join them. The hybrid's rise has been encouraged by pressure from environmentalists and regulators, particularly California rules curbing greenhouse gases and smog-forming pollutants.
1/22/2003	Ford Posts Smaller Loss, But Its Costs Are Rising	The Ford Motor Company reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter today but continues to lose money and market share while its chief rival, General Motors, has posted profits and gained market share in the last two years. A year into Ford's corporate turnaround plan, overall costs continued to rise in 2002 because of, among other things, big changes in redesigned or new sport utility vehicles like the Lincoln Navigator, Aviator and Ford Expedition. The company said its goal was to trim $500 million from its costs this year.
1/22/2003	Some sponsors are backing off to fine-tune the art of blending their products into television shows.	AS ''American Idol'' returned to Fox last night for a second season, the products of five sponsors are playing prominent roles during the episodes themselves. But only three of the five -- AT&T Wireless, Coca-Cola and Ford Motor -- will have placements so pervasive that viewers must shut their eyes, or change the channel, to avoid them. And while the ubiquitous Coca-Cola red sofa, bearing the Coke logo, will be back for a second run, the intensity of the show's product placements will be dialed down compared with last season. Fox's midcourse correction on ''American Idol'' is indicative of the adjustments being made by television networks, advertisers and agencies as they proceed with aggressive plans to embed products in episodes of entertainment shows. Madison Avenue is increasingly anxious about the growing ability of viewers to zip, zap, mute or otherwise ignore traditional commercials with personal video recorders like TiVo or with remote controls.
1/20/2003	In a Slow Start, Ford Opens an Auto Factory in China	The Ford Motor Company officially opened its first car factory in China today, striving to catch up in what has become the world's fastest-growing market for automobiles. Ford, which already builds full-size Transit vans in China, has begun assembling here its Fiesta compact sedan, a model that is popular in Europe and slightly smaller than the Ford Focus sold in the United States. David W. Thursfield, Ford's executive vice president for international operations, said that the Chinese auto market was likely to overtake Germany's in size and perhaps even Japan's in the next three to five years.
1/12/2003	Big Dreams Cause Big Eyes: From Concept to Production	CONCEPT cars are the dream machines of auto shows, unattainable flashes of show-biz glamour among vehicles that come with easy-payment plans, extended warranties and Scotchgard fabric protection. Concept cars are not for sale, and they may say more about the state of mind of the industry than about the state of the art of engineering. At this year's Detroit show, which opened yesterday after a week of previews and media events, gee-whiz future technologies are less in evidence than powerful but wistful visions of big American cars, like prewar limousines and the full-size sedan that until recently was almost written off as extinct.
1/11/2003	FORD IS ADDING TO UNDERFUNDED PENSION PLAN	The Ford Motor Company contributed $500 million to its underfunded United States pension plan this month and said it planned to add another $500 million by June. Ford cut the assumed rate of return on its pension funds in the United States, Canada and Britain to 8.75 percent from 9.5 percent, the chief financial officer, Allan Gilmour, told investors on a conference call yesterday. The lower rate of return on the pension assets in the United States will result in an estimated 2003 pretax pension cost of $270 million after a gain of $190 million last year. Mr. Gilmour said Ford had identified $992 million of $1 billion more in cost savings to help offset pension expenses.
1/10/2003	The Ford of the Future: Longer, Lower, Wider	DO American cars have to be lame? Some people are pretty sure the answer is no. ''I don't think the American auto industry lost the market to the Japanese,'' J Mays, the Ford Motor Company's top designer, said this week in Detroit. ''I think we simply walked away from something we used to do very well.''
1/5/2003	Will Soft Touches Mean Softer Sales for the Mighty F-150?	THE 2004 F-150 pickup truck from the Ford Motor Company will not even go on sale until this summer, but the debate over its design, which Ford has unsuccessfully tried to keep a secret, has been raging for months. At Web sites like F150online.com and Ford-trucks.com, message board postings burst with spy photographs and taut emotion: love, devotion, outrage. ''The F-150 is a truck,'' wrote a man who identified himself as Matthew from Stillwater, Okla., ''not a freaking glorified car.''
1/4/2003	G.M. Lifts Market Share On Sales Burst In December	General Motors, intent on increasing its market share for the second consecutive year, turned to a fire sale last month that lifted sales 36 percent and helped it accomplish its goal, according to figures released today. The back-to-back annual gain in market share was the first since 1976, but it was made possible by zero percent financing deals and reliance on less profitable sales to corporate and rental fleets. Now Wall Street and Detroit are wondering whether several years of outsize vehicle sales, propped up by increasingly large incentives from the Big Three, will make a feast or famine of 2003. Added to that is the uncertain economy and the potential for war in Iraq.
1/3/2003	A Century Of Fords	It should be a big moment for car collectors -- the 100th anniversary of the Ford Motor Company. Ford is celebrating the anniversary by producing five centennial vehicles with collectors in mind. Only a few thousand will be made. Ford Motor was formed on June 16, 1903, by Henry Ford and a group of investors. The company and the automobile business in general took off a few years later with Ford's Model T. The centennial cars will come only in black, honoring Henry Ford's famous decree that buyers of his Model T could have it in any color as long as it was black. Ford insisted on black because it dried faster than other colors, speeding up production.
12/29/2002	Other Advice for Ford	To the Editor: Re ''Ford and Goldman, So Cozy at the Top'' (Dec. 8), which described the long friendship of William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor, and John L. Thornton, a president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs:
12/21/2002	FORD SELLS ELECTRIC VEHICLE UNIT, CITING POOR SALES	Ford Motor said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its Think Nordic electric vehicle unit to Kamkorp Ltd. of Britain. Terms were not disclosed. Ford said in August that it would stop selling the vehicles, citing slow demand. Ford has sold 5,280 Think Neighbor cars in the United States so far this year, barely one-tenth of 1 percent of Ford's total of 3.3 million vehicles sold. Ford said Think would be taken over by Kamkorp Microelectronics, a unit of Kamkorp based in Switzerland. The agreement may preserve 100 jobs at Think's plant in Aurskog, Norway, because Kamkorp plans to continue development and production of electric vehicles, a Ford spokesman, Don Hume, said.
12/16/2002	Economy & Business; Big 3 Automakers Are Likely to Swerve Into the Slow Lane	HEADING into this year, a question hung over the Motor City: Could the boom-time sales pace of recent years, fueled by the mighty growth of sport utilities, possibly continue? The answer for much of 2002 was a resounding yes. So now analysts are asking the same question about 2003. And this time even auto executives are bracing for a slump.
12/13/2002	Ford to Review How Chairman Got 400,000 Goldman Shares	The board of the Ford Motor Company announced yesterday that it had formed a committee to look into the allocation of shares of Goldman Sachs to William Clay Ford Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive. Goldman Sachs allocated 400,000 shares to Mr. Ford in 1999 as part of its initial public offering. Ford and Goldman have a longstanding business relationship and John L. Thornton, a president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, has been a Ford director since 1996.
12/8/2002	Ford and Goldman, So Cozy at the Top	WHEN a Congressional committee in October revealed the many ties between Wall Street firms and their clients, one of its noteworthy findings concerned the Goldman Sachs Group. It had allocated shares from its 1999 initial public offering to William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company. By the next day, the actual number leaked -- 400,000 shares, by far the largest individual award, worth $52 million at its peak and $29.8 million now. But no one apparently picked up on something even more interesting: John L. Thornton, a president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman, is an old prep-school pal of Mr. Ford's, someone with whom he shares several friends and even more interests. He also serves on Ford's board.
12/4/2002	Big Three's Auto Sales Fell Sharply in November	Sales at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company fell sharply in November from robust levels a year ago, and stocks of both companies were battered today. Many investors are concerned about the prospect of slumping industry sales next year, which even the automakers are expecting, coupled with increasing competition as foreign carmakers open more plants in the United States and continue to encroach on the lucrative pickup and sport utility market.
12/4/2002	National Briefing | West: California: Ford Penalty Overturned	The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, threw out $70 million in punitive damages against the Ford Motor Company. The court upheld a $2.5 million compensatory award in the case, to the parents of Walter White, a 3-year-old who was killed when a Ford truck rolled over him after its parking brake failed. The court held that the punitive award was improper because the trial court, in Nevada, had allowed the jury to consider Ford's conduct in other states. The court ordered a retrial limited to the punitive award. Adam Liptak (NYT)
11/27/2002	Ford Motor Is Linked to Argentina's 'Dirty War'	Pedro Troiani was at work on the assembly line at the Ford Motor plant here one morning in April 1976 when more than a dozen heavily armed men burst into the factory and made their way toward him, he recalled recently. At gunpoint, he said, he was paraded through the plant and driven in a company truck to a soccer field in the factory complex where, he said, the Argentine Army had set up a barracks and detention center.
11/24/2002	The Nation: The Price of Success; Now, Add God to the List of Enemies of the S.U.V.	IT'S not often you see a rabbi being chauffeured by a nun in a car emblazoned with the slogan ''What Would Jesus Drive?'' But such was the scene last week, when a coalition of Christian and Jewish religious leaders came here to press automakers for more fuel-efficient vehicles, and were ferried between General Motors and the Ford Motor Company by a convoy of nuns driving the Toyota Prius, a small car that combines gas and electric power. The slogan, which attracted much attention, was the work of Evangelical Environmental Network, a small grassroots group.
11/20/2002	FORD SELLS $3 BILLION IN VEHICLE LOANS TO BEAR, STEARNS	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it had sold $3 billion of vehicle loans to Bear, Stearns & Company after concern about Ford's ability to repay debt drove up borrowing costs. Ford manages or holds $204 billion in vehicle loans. The transaction is the first in which Ford has sold loans outright and is part of efforts to lower its reliance on the corporate bond market. The company plans to increase sales of debt backed by auto loans, and analysts said the loan sale gave it another alternative for raising money.
11/19/2002	A Group Links Fuel Economy To Religion	A broad coalition of religious groups is preparing a grass-roots campaign linking fuel efficiency to morality, with some ads going so far as to ask: ''What Would Jesus Drive?'' Leaders of the effort are coming to Detroit on Wednesday to meet with William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company. They will also meet with executives at General Motors.
11/18/2002	The Corporations Behind the Curtain: Six Supporters of the Arts	Support of the arts has become an integral part of the philanthropy programs of corporations nationwide; for some company foundations, arts support constitutes more than 30 percent of their total giving. Here is a look at six notable companies that are regarded as important forces in the giving field, though there are dozens more that offer comparable programs. The figures supplied are for the companies' philanthropic foundations, unless otherwise noted. BEN SISARIO
11/17/2002	Ford Designer's Space Odyssey	''BACK to basics'' is Ford's motto these days. For most executives, that means selling enough Explorers and F-150 pickups to return to profitability. But it means something more to J Mays, vice president for global design, whose Ma design study is the most basic automobile conceivable -- a high-concept car that rethinks the automobile from the ground up. Appropriately minimal for a man whose first name is a single letter, the Ma is made of bamboo, aluminum and carbon fiber and looks like a dune buggy crossed with a racecar. ''A piece of art as well as a two-seat neighborhood cruiser'' is how the car is billed by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it is the centerpiece of a show, ''Retrofuturism: The Car Design of J. Mays.'' The exhibition opens today and runs through March 9.
11/15/2002	A Top Ford Executive Gets Even More Duties	The Ford Motor Company today expanded the duties of David W. Thursfield, one of its top executives, reinforcing speculation that Mr. Thursfield is being groomed to take the No. 2 spot eventually under the chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr. Ford's foreign businesses were consolidated under Mr. Thursfield, 57, who was promoted from group vice president to executive vice president and was named president for international operations. The company also named James J. Padilla, 56, an executive vice president as well as president for North American operations. He had been group vice president for those operations.
11/13/2002	Suit Says Companies Aided Apartheid	Twenty-two large companies, including International Business Machines, Ford and Citigroup, were named yesterday in a lawsuit charging that they aided the former apartheid government of South Africa, lending support to forced labor, torture and other crimes. ''This complaint seeks to hold those businesses that aided and abetted the apartheid regime responsible for the wrongs they made possible,'' said a statement by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, one of three American law firms that joined a South African firm in filing the suit.
11/13/2002	Matel Dawson Jr., 81, Is Dead; Philanthropic Auto Worker	Matel Dawson Jr., a forklift operator with a ninth-grade education who gave more than $1 million to universities for scholarships and to charities, died on Nov. 2 in his one-bedroom apartment in Highland Park, Mich. He was 81. The cause was a heart attack, his daughter, JoAnn Agee, said.
11/12/2002	Ford's Ex-Chief Hired to Rebuild Polaroid	Jacques A. Nasser, the former chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said today that he was joining Bank One's leveraged-buyout arm and would become nonexecutive chairman of its most prominent investment, Polaroid. The announcement puts Mr. Nasser, 54, back in business a little more than a year after being forced out at Ford by William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and heir who succeeded him as chief executive. It also finds him reinventing himself as a turnaround specialist at One Equity, the buyout firm that is an arm of Bank One.
11/10/2002	The Spy Who Drove Me	POOR Q. In one James Bond film after another, the top secret service engineer has provided whiz-bang gizmos for the cars that Agent 007 drives. The Aston Martin Vanquish in the latest, 20th, movie, ''Die Another Day,'' has machine guns under the hood and rockets behind the grille -- nothing new in the Bond world. The film's really novel effects are not Q's inventions, but marketing gimmicks. Lasers and atomic ray guns are pass; brand synergy is what drives Bond these days. The Bond films, of course, are the ultimate product placement for automakers. This time, Ford is the ''supplier of choice,'' thanks to its ownership of Aston Martin, the small British automaker that supplied the most notable of all Bond cars, the DB5 grand tourer made famous in ''Goldfinger.'' (A replica of that car is displayed in the International Spy Museum in Washington.)
11/9/2002	LINCOLN-MERCURY UNIT WILL RETURN TO MICHIGAN	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would move the headquarters of its Lincoln-Mercury division from Irvine, Calif., back to Ford's corporate headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. The move will take place next summer and affect about 90 employees. Lincoln-Mercury was moved to Irvine in 1998 in an effort to make the brands more distinct from the Ford label. The company had also hoped to distinguish Lincoln as a global luxury brand, packaging it with Land Rover, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo as the Premier Automotive Group, which was based in London but had its North American headquarters in Irvine. But Ford's global aspirations for Lincoln went largely unfulfilled, and earlier this year the brand was removed from the luxury group. Danny Hakim (NYT)
11/6/2002	VISTEON OFFERS EARLY RETIREMENT TO 12% OF U.S. WORKERS	Visteon, the auto parts maker, offered early retirement to 12 percent of its salaried workers in the United States yesterday in an effort to restore profits. About 1,100 of 9,300 salaried workers are eligible, a spokesman, Greg Gardner, said. Employees must be at least 55 years old or have 30 years of service with Visteon and its former parent, Ford Motor. Visteon, which has relied on Ford for about 80 percent of revenue since being spun off in 2000, is being hurt by Ford's falling sales and market share.
11/6/2002	A Low-Cost Model Is a Big Headache for Ford	The Ford Focus might be the most error-prone car in the industry. The low-cost car, which was introduced in 1999, has had a total of 11 safety recalls and is the subject of five defect investigations by federal regulators. And two new recalls this week, including a wiring problem that could, in worst-case situations, cause engine fires, raise even more questions.
11/1/2002	Big Three Carmakers Expect Sharp Drop in Monthly Sales	Carmakers are expecting a sharp falloff when they report October sales on Friday, and some analysts fear that a second consecutive month of slumping results could indicate an end to boom times for auto sales. Many analysts have been cutting back their expectations for October throughout the month, and J. D. Power & Associates is forecasting sales at the lowest monthly rate in four years.
10/27/2002	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Ford Expedition; Smooth Transition: Still Big, Now Better	FORD says its 2003 Expedition has 123 innovations, a number that seems exaggerated if you hew to the dictionary, which defines an innovation as ''something newly introduced; a new method, custom, device.'' Some of the features are not truly new, for they have been incorporated into cars or trucks before. These include second-row seats that recline, second-row captain's chairs, an aluminum engine block and electronic brake-force distribution. But even if you disregard those items and some others, several true innovations remain on the list. By Ford's count, 27 of the advancements are either exclusive or are ''best in class'' designs. This is not just hype; those features move the Expedition well ahead of the competition in full-size sport utilities.
10/26/2002	S.&P. Cuts Its Rating Of Ford Debt To Record Low	Executives at the Ford Motor Company tried to persuade investors this week that it was focused on its restructuring and planned to accelerate its comeback plan. But today, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cut Ford's long-term debt rating to its lowest level ever, citing competitive pressures that it fears will hinder the company's efforts. Further, S.& P. said the outlook for Ford remained negative, a designation that analysts said concerned them more than the downgrade, which had been expected.
10/24/2002	U.S. Carmakers Losing Ground To Imports Despite Deals	The billions of dollars that General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have spent during the last year on the most generous sales incentives in automotive history have not bought them what they wanted: a bigger share of the market. The latest offers -- for everything from Chevrolet Cavaliers to Cadillac Escalades and Ford Focuses to Jaguar S-Types -- include zero percent loans, with no money down and no monthly payments until 2003, or else thousands of dollars in cash rebates. The deals are available not only on leftover 2002 models, but also on the newest cars and trucks.
10/24/2002	National Briefing | West: California: A Mega-Award Still Stands	The State Supreme Court, in a 4-to-3 decision, declined to hear a challenge to the largest punitive award in a personal injury case ever affirmed in American history. The decision let stand a $290 million award by a Ceres, Calif., jury to the family of three people killed in the rollover of a Ford Bronco in 1993. Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Ford, said his client would ask the United States Supreme Court to hear the case. Adam Liptak (NYT)
10/23/2002	Ford Gives River Rouge a Green Coat	SINCE 1918 around Detroit, the words ''River Rouge'' and ''Ford'' have been associated with simple, traditional things: steel, coal, cars, trucks, smoke, soot and jobs. Now it means sedum, too. At a time when nearly all of the auto industry's attention has been focused on the tumbling stock price and multibillion-dollar losses at the Ford Motor Company, the company's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., has created a buzz by installing sedum, a rugged plant that is used as ground cover, in an unlikely place -- on the roof of a new 1.1-million-square-foot assembly plant in the River Rouge complex here.
10/22/2002	Ford Is Seeking $1 Billion More in Cuts	Ford Motor's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., said today that industrywide auto sales were softer than last month and he asked executives at the automaker to find another $1 billion in cost cuts. Mr. Ford told investors in Boston at one of at least four presentations planned for this week that auto sales so far this month were lagging September levels and that forecasting next year was difficult.
10/17/2002	For Ford and G.M., the Problems Ahead Have Different Sources	While the stocks of General Motors and Ford Motor are falling almost in tandem, the risks seen in the two American automakers are divergent. For Ford, there is worry about its auto business; for G.M., there is worry about much besides its auto business. Today, Ford reported a $326 million loss for the third quarter and the long-term ratings of both Ford and its financial subsidiary, Ford Credit, were put on a credit watch with negative implications by Standard & Poor's. The bond market has taken a dim view of Ford's prospects and the action by the S.& P., a crucial rating agency, only served to drive the company's borrowing costs up further. Wall Street is concerned about the progress that Ford executives are making in cutting costs from bloated manufacturing operations while also bolstering a product lineup that has been losing market share.

10/13/2002	Fuel Gauge Is Near 'E' For the Big Three	SINCE 9/11, major auto companies have relied heavily on zero percent financing to bolster sales. Worried that such methods have hurt profit margins, however, investors have bid down prices of auto company stocks and bonds. Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, has been bearish on the group since the summer. Last week, he discussed his reasons. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
10/11/2002	Ford to Meet Major Investors in an Attempt to Ease Concerns	With Ford stock in rapid retreat, senior executives plan to meet with major investors next week to appeal for patience as the company tries a turnaround. But a warm reception from Wall Street seems unlikely, analysts say. Investors regard the Ford Motor Company as the weakest among Big Three auto companies, and analysts said they did not sense much urgency in its overhaul efforts. To battle back, the company's critics contend, Ford must send clearer signals about its condition and demonstrate how it intends to deal with a potential recession that might disrupt its plans.
10/10/2002	Market Place; Ford Motor's Legs Are Wobbly Under Finance Unit's Debt Load	What made shares of the Ford Motor Company plummet yesterday for the second consecutive trading session? The answer, investors and credit analysts say, was nothing and everything. Nothing, because there was no bad news about car sales in general or Ford's operations in particular to prompt yesterday's 7.7 percent decline in the stock. Everything, because investors seem to be awakening to a host of weaknesses in Ford's financial position.
10/8/2002	Supreme Court Refuses to Hear Tire Appeal	The United States Supreme Court refused today to hear an appeal from a tire maker of a $3.3 million jury award in the 1995 highway death of a Mississippi woman. The court refused to consider the argument by the tire maker, the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, that the size of the award was so excessive that it violated the constitutional right to due process. The justices issued a one-line order without further comment.
10/3/2002	CHRYSLER EXPANDS INCENTIVES ON 2003 MODELS	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler is expanding the availability of some no-interest loans and lowering interest rates on other 2003 models as it adjusts its strategy of offering fewer sales incentives than General Motors and Ford Motor, its rivals in the United States. Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker, will offer five-year no-interest loans on minivans and 2.9 percent 60-month loans on all 2003 cars that had carried 4.9 percent financing, said a spokesman, Marc Henretta. Cash rebates rose as high as $2,500 from $1,500, he said.
10/2/2002	Slow September Sales Lead to New Auto Incentives	The robust pace of auto sales slowed in September, causing a fresh round of big incentives from Ford and General Motors and debate from Wall Street about the industry's outlook. Over all, industry sales rose 3.2 percent compared with September 2001, but fell sharply from the strong pace this year. Last month, sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 16.3 million vehicles, compared with 18.7 million in August and 18.1 million in July, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
9/29/2002	A New-Model Ford on a Risky Track	IN the lobby of Ford Motor's corporate headquarters here, there's a countdown clock that, at one moment this morning, read 260 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds. That's how long William Clay Ford Jr. has to right his great-grandfather's company before its centennial on June 16. ''The centennial is obviously a hugely important time for this company because it celebrates something that most American companies don't reach,'' Mr. Ford said in an interview looking back on his first 11 months as chief executive. ''As proud as I am of our history, I'm more interested in our future.''
9/27/2002	FORD SAYS IT WILL CUT SEVERAL THOUSAND JOBS THIS YEAR	The Ford Motor Company will cut several thousand factory jobs in the United States by the end of the year under its turnaround plan, the chief operating officer, Nicholas V. Scheele, said yesterday. The reductions are part of a previously announced plan to eliminate 35,000 jobs, including 12,000 last year, and close five factories by 2005. No more factories will be shut down because market share would go down, Mr. Scheele said in an interview at the Paris auto show. The chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., is aiming to have the company reach pretax profit of $7 billion annually by 2005. The company lost $5.45 billion last year.
9/24/2002	World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: Strike Deadline At Ford	The Canadian Auto Workers union said that Ford Motor Company's local unit would be its next target for negotiations on a new labor contract with the Big Three North American automakers. The union, which agreed on a three-year contract with General Motors of Canada last week, said its 12,900 members at Ford would go on strike if no deal was reached by Oct. 1. The talks with Ford will center on the company's plan to close an F-150 pickup truck plant in Oakville, Ontario, next year with the loss of about 1,500 jobs. Bernard Simon (NYT)

I learned this behind the wheel of the Think City, a tiny, odd-looking commuter vehicle that I drove to the train station for two weeks. I liked it, and so did lots of folks I passed by. They waved. Some drivers rolled down their windows and asked how they could get one. Small crowds gathered when I parked. Two electricians leaning on their van gave me a pair of thumbs-ups as I whirred by.
9/20/2002	FORD'S JAGUAR UNIT PLANS TO CUT 400 JOBS IN BRITAIN	Ford Motor's Jaguar luxury-car unit said yesterday that it was offering early retirement incentives to cut 400 jobs, or 3.8 percent of its British work force, to reduce costs. The reductions will come mostly from managers and will be voluntary, a spokesman said. Ford intends to make the cuts by the end of the year from Jaguar's three assembly plants. Jaguar said earlier that it was reducing production in September and October at the Halewood factory in Liverpool, England, where the X-type is built. The spokesman said the 400 jobs were not related to those cuts. Jaguar employs 10,600 workers in Britain.
9/19/2002	A new campaign on Fox TV guarantees to push the envelope.	TWO Fox television networks, reinforcing their brand image of brash risk-taking that sometimes steps over the line, are planning two clutter-busting initiatives that are sure to be controversial. First, as part of a series of commercials that begin running this week to promote ''The Best Damn Sports Show Period'' on the Fox Sports Net cable network, the boxer Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist, will be shown as if he were baby-sitting, singing a lullaby as he rocks the infant to sleep.
9/13/2002	Really Cool New Seats	He's wearing socks and a sturdy crew-neck shirt with his khaki shorts. Her summer wear is far less substantial. It's a setup for an argument about setting the air-conditioner, even with separate fan adjustments on each side of the car. Or maybe one of the passengers is the type who's never cool enough on a blistering day, even with the air-conditioning at its top level. What to do? The next logical step in cooling -- and personalization -- is cooled seats. Car seats that warm up in the winter aren't new, but seats with their own air-conditioning are less familiar. Saab introduced them first, in its 9-5 sedan and station wagon. In the Saab, flat fans beneath the seat and in its lower back draw hot air trapped between the seat and the passenger through perforations in the leather -- and away. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class has a similar seat cooler.
9/13/2002	FORD SAYS IT WILL ACCOUNT FOR OPTIONS AS AN EXPENSE	The Ford Motor company, the world's second-largest automaker, will start accounting for stock options as an expense in January to reflect the cost of paying executives and other employees, the company said yesterday. The expense last year would have been about $150 million, or 8 cents a share, the company said. Ford employees hold options to buy more than 172 million common shares. Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., joins General Motors, the world's largest automaker, in counting options as an expense. More companies are under pressure to make the change after accounting scandals led to the collapse of Enron and WorldCom.
9/10/2002	Ford, Defying Forecasts, Says It Expects Quarterly Profit	Buoyed by strong industry sales and progress in its cost-cutting efforts, the Ford Motor Company said today that it expected to post an operating profit for the current quarter. Analysts had expected an operating loss of 10 cents a share in the third quarter, according to Thomson First Call. The company also reaffirmed its previous forecast for a small profit for the full year. ''We beat analyst estimates in the first and second quarters and we will do it again in the third quarter,'' William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ''On an operating basis, we expect to report a small profit for the third quarter.'' That was good news for Ford stock, which was battered last week. Today, shares of Ford closed at $10.80, up 60 cents, or 5.9 percent. Last week, the company's shares fell more than 13 percent after a downgrade by UBS Warburg and a report from Goldman, Sachs that was pessimistic about the financial health of the Big Three. Ford, after a run of success in the late 1990's, has come under pressure on several fronts, from the bruising Firestone tire controversy to criticism that its pipeline of new products is running dry. Ford stock traded as high as $30 a share last year, but the company ended 2001 with a $5.5 billion loss. In January, the company embarked on a turnaround plan under Mr. Ford, who is the great-grandson of Henry Ford. One of the company's biggest priorities is revamping its cost structure. Financial analysts say that Ford's manufacturing efficiencies lag behind not just Toyota and Honda but also its domestic rival, General Motors. The Goldman, Sachs report was also pessimistic about the long-term costs for both Ford and G.M. of zero percent financing and other incentive programs as well as the potential ramifications if the boom in home mortgage refinancing slows, giving consumers less cash to spend. Ford officials said the report was too dire in its outlook. Today, the company said it was on track for its second consecutive profitable quarter, excluding one-time charges, after four quarters in the red. The company had previously forecast a loss for the quarter. Officials also said today that the company might increase it's goal of reducing costs by $700 a vehicle. They also said they were on track to meet their goal of trimming $2 billion in costs unrelated to products this year by cutting expenses from salaries to office supplies. The quarter has also been bolstered by continued spending by Americans on automobiles. August was a very strong month for the industry. Ford's sales rose 8.2 percent in August, though it lost market share, falling almost a full point from the level a year earlier. But the company did sell more of its lucrative Explorer sport utility vehicles than in any other month. Analysts said that today's profit forecast showed signs of progress on cutting costs. ''This demonstrates our success in capitalizing on larger-than-expected industry volumes,'' Mr. Ford said. ''At the same time, we are making steady progress on our revitalization plan.'' Scott Hill, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, called the announcement ''a surprise.'' Mr. Hill said the most encouraging news was that the company had improved its profitability without increasing production, which indicates Ford is making some progress on cutting costs. ''They are on the right track,'' he said. But he added, ''They've got a long way to go.''
9/6/2002	Canadian Union Picks G.M. for First Talks	The union representing 46,000 Canadian auto workers today chose General Motors as its target -- the company that it will negotiate a new labor contract with first, to set a pattern for contracts with the others. But the union indicated that its most serious issues were with Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler, not G.M. Announcing the choice to cheering union officials at a Toronto hotel, Buzz Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, said job security remained the union's top concern even though car and truck sales are strong. ''Restructuring, job losses, layoffs and closures are still threats that we're having to face in our bargaining,'' Mr. Hargrove said. The union will also seek ''substantial'' wage increases, he said.
9/5/2002	Point Man for a Ford Turnaround; Lots of Eggs Find Their Way Into Europe Chief's Basket	Few managers are better cast in the role of fixer than David W. Thursfield, the most intense Ford Motor executive this side of Jacques Nasser, the deposed chief executive. Mr. Thursfield's steel blue eyes rarely blink, and his voice is so soft that at times it barely registers above a mumble. Yet he has listeners rapt, from Wall Street to Detroit. Ford, which lost $5.5 billion last year, concedes that its turnaround is behind schedule, and it increasingly appears to be Mr. Thursfield's job to change that.
9/5/2002	No-Interest Financing and Rebates Sent Car Sales Up 13.5% in August	The nation's largest automakers reported today that they broke industry sales records in August, fueled by bountiful incentives and a willingness by otherwise wary consumers to spend money on new vehicles. More pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles were sold last month than in any single month in the industry's history. Light trucks, including minivans, made up 51.5 percent of industry sales in August.
9/1/2002	Private Sector; A Ford in the Public Ear	While her husband, William C. Ford Jr., is starring in his second round of commercials for the Ford Motor Company, Lisa V. Ford has her own ads running on Detroit's airwaves. But while her husband extols Ford's lineup of vehicles, Mrs. Ford's radio spots promote a benefit concert for the Children's Center of Wayne County. The concert, set for Thursday night, will feature Gladys Knight and will be the first entertainment event at Ford Field, the new downtown arena for the Detroit Lions, the football team owned by the Ford family.
8/31/2002	Ford Abandons Venture in Making Electric Cars	In another sign of the auto industry's struggle to make money selling electric vehicles, the Ford Motor Company said today that it was giving up on Think, an electric-car venture in which it sank $123 million. Instead, Ford said it would invest in other forms of alternative fuel technology like hybrid-electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells. Ford's move comes despite a regulatory mandate in California requiring manufacturers to offer up to 100,000 electric and other low-emissions vehicles a year, beginning with the 2003 model year, which officially starts Oct. 1. Similar requirements are pending in New York and Massachusetts, extending the mandate to one-fifth of the American auto market.

8/28/2002	When Juries Set the Punishment	To the Editor: Guilt or innocence should be determined by a jury of one's peers. Punitive damages, however, need more rational thought and less emotion (front page, Aug. 26). Perhaps a panel of judges or experts in a particular field could determine the penalties.
8/28/2002	Many Marketers Will Forgo Ads During Sept. 11	Two weeks before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a consensus seems to be emerging about advertising on that day: less will be more. Most marketers, agencies and media companies are deciding that they would rather go adless or limit their advertising than risk being perceived as exploiting the day for mercenary purposes.
8/28/2002	When Juries Set the Punishment	To the Editor: Re ''Debate Grows on Jury's Role in Injury Cases'' (front page, Aug. 26):
8/28/2002	When Juries Set the Punishment	To the Editor: The suggestion by some legal experts that judges might be superior to juries in awarding punitive damages in lawsuits was scary (front page, Aug. 26). Why should an individual wield the power to punish corporations economically? With the money corporations have to play with to get what they want, no one is immune from the temptation.
8/28/2002	When Juries Set the Punishment	To the Editor: The ''debate'' about the role of the civil jury system in awarding both compensatory and punitive damages in cases of corporate fraud and wrongdoing (front page, Aug. 26) is a creature of the apologists for Big Tobacco, Enron and their ilk.
8/27/2002	Sex-Bias Suit Against Ford Is Dismissed on Trial Remarks	A sexual harassment lawsuit against the Ford Motor Company has been dismissed because the plaintiff and her lawyers had discussed with reporters evidence that the court deemed inadmissible, even though much of the information was a matter of public record. The suit was dismissed last week by Circuit Court Judge William J. Giovan, who ruled that the plaintiff, Justine Maldonado, and her lawyer had disseminated information about a defendant's previous conviction in an attempt to prejudice potential jurors, and in violation of a Michigan law.
8/26/2002	Debate Grows On Jury's Role In Injury Cases	It was the largest punitive award ever affirmed by an American court in a personal injury case: $290 million to the family of three people killed in the rollover of a Ford Bronco. The jury in California deliberated for five days after the four-month trial ended three years ago, before ordering the Ford Motor Company to pay up.
8/25/2002	Business; In Detroit, Steady Hands Are Steadying Nerves	PERPETUALLY known as a one-industry town, Detroit has always been a place where chief executives have been fawned over, gossiped about and followed as if they were movie stars or sports heroes. But lately, the spotlight has shifted one box lower on the organization chart. The city's two most prominent chief financial officers -- John M. Devine, 55, at General Motors, and Allan D. Gilmour, 68, at Ford Motor -- have become the men to watch. Both have been in their current jobs for relatively short periods, and both are well known to Wall Street analysts and credit ratings agencies because of their lengthy automotive careers. That familiarity is proving an asset, as executives at some other big American companies have been led away in handcuffs and as a jittery stock market has reacted violently to bad news.
8/24/2002	Some Insurers Halt Coverage for Vans Linked to Rollovers	After deadly rollover crashes of 15-passenger vans that killed or injured young athletes, church choir members and summer campers, a growing number of colleges and churches are prohibiting or severely limiting the use of the vehicles, and some insurance companies are refusing to insure the vans as costly lawsuit settlements threaten to cut into their profits. Accidents involving athletes from Urbana University, Kenyon College, DePaul University, the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and Prairie View A&M University within three months led federal officials to issue a well-publicized warning about the vans two years ago.
8/22/2002	FORD IS REVIEWING EMPLOYEE POLICIES ON EVALUATIONS	The Ford Motor Company is reviewing policies, including pay and evaluations, for about 127,000 salaried employees worldwide as it tries to improve worker morale. The automaker wants to complete the review by next year's first quarter, a spokeswoman, Anne Marie Gattari, said. The chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., has said he wants to improve employee relations. Ford settled discrimination lawsuits last year arising from an evaluation system instituted under the watch of Jacques Nasser, the former chief executive.
8/20/2002	Ford Stresses Business, but Disappoints Environmentalists	After a delay of almost four months, Ford Motor will release its third annual corporate citizenship report today. The previous reports have earned the praise of environmental groups and the disapproval of some competitors because of Ford's frank discussion of subjects like the impact of sport utility vehicles on global warming and smog-forming pollutants.
8/13/2002	FORD TO SELL KWIK-FIT TO CVC CAPITAL FOR $505 MILLION	The Ford Motor Company will sell Kwik-Fit Holding, a European car repair chain, to CVC Capital Partners for ?330 million ($505 million), a third of what Ford paid for it three years ago. Ford said in January that it would sell the business as well as two others in the United States to help raise $1 billion to stem losses and focus on automaking. Ford bought Kwik-Fit for ?1.01 billion in 1999 as the former chief executive, Jacques Nasser, expanded into car service businesses. Ford, which is based in Dearborn, Mich., said it would have third-quarter costs of about $500 million from the Kwik-Fit sale. Ford will keep a 19 percent stake in Kwik-Fit, which had sales last year of ?762 million.
8/12/2002	Ford to Advertise On Sept. 11	Although a number of advertisers are opting not to, the Ford MotorCompany plans to advertise on Sept. 11. ''The terrorists win when business stops,'' said Paige Johnson, communications manager for global marketing for Ford in Dearborn, Mich., confirming a report of the decision in USA Today on Friday.
8/10/2002	A Return to Profitability; Big Recall Behind It, Tire Maker Regains Its Footing	Two years ago, Japan's major tire maker, the Bridgestone Corporation, was staggering from a huge, embarrassing recall of Firestone tires that threatened to crush its American subsidiary. Today, Bridgestone reported strong profits for the first half of the year, and said for the first time that it expected its American operations to turn a profit for the year. Though Bridgestone is still grappling with stiff industry competition and the uncertain economic outlook in its main markets, executives celebrated today a return to stability that few analysts thought possible in 2000. ''The recovery has been remarkable,'' said Michael K. Gorey, chief financial officer of the company's American arm, Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holdings.
8/8/2002	Ford Heir Says Nation's Affair With the Car Has Lost Its Zip	William Clay Ford Jr. said today that a credibility gap on environmental issues had eroded America's love for cars. Mr. Ford, the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, also said he wanted to ''lower the temperature'' of the industry's often contentious relationship with California regulators. ''During the nearly 25 years I've worked in the industry, the love affair that people have had with automobiles has in some ways grown stale, and some would say it's even dying,'' Mr. Ford said. ''If you remember, in California, people used to write songs about T-Birds and Corvettes. Today, they write regulations.''
8/2/2002	Car Sales in Surprise Jump, And G.M. Leads the Pack	Car and truck sales in the United States rose a surprising 8.6 percent in July, largely because of aggressive incentives from automakers. The General Motors Corporation reinstated zero-percent financing early last month, a reprise of the incentives it offered after the Sept. 11 attacks. As a result, its combined car and truck sales led the industry, rising by 23.9 percent in July compared with figures for the month a year earlier.
7/31/2002	Ford Said to Be Close to Ending The Excursion	The Ford Motor Company has decided not to build a second generation of the Excursion sport utility vehicle, which is seven feet tall and able to seat a softball team, people close to Ford's future product program said tonight. The Excursion, cited by critics as the industry's most visible symbol of sport utility vehicle excess, is expected to be discontinued at the conclusion of the 2004 model year, meaning that it will have lasted only one generation. The Excursion was introduced in 1999 as a 2000 model year vehicle.
7/30/2002	Ford Motor Shuffles Some Executives	Ford Motor gave Mark Schulz, president of its Asia Pacific unit, added responsibility today for South American operations as the company, the second-largest automaker, shifts executive assignments. The decision is related to the appointment of David Thursfield, 56, as head of purchasing and international business, said a spokesman, Christian Vinyard. Mr. Thursfield, who starts his duties on Thursday, took over responsibilities from Carlos Mazzorin, 60, who becomes senior adviser to the office of chairman and chief executive.
7/28/2002	Who Gets the Keys?	I COME from a family of nine boys and two girls. I haven't been out of a job since I was 11. My brothers and I all wanted morning paper routes so we could have our afternoons free for baseball or football. In a good week, we might make $10 delivering papers. The people at The Detroit Free Press loved us. When we took over a route, they could count on it being in our family for 10 years or longer; we would pass it down from brother to brother. At one time, our family had as many as five routes with more than 300 customers.
7/19/2002	For an S.U.V., A Leg Up	Running boards -- steps alongside a vehicle to help riders climb into the cabin -- were introduced on stagecoaches, adapted to horseless carriages and added to glamour cars of the 1930's, pickup trucks and hot rods of the 50's. Now, the Ford Motor Company has added power to this standby. The 2003 Lincoln Navigator and the Ford Expedition have the industry's first power running boards. Open the doors of the full-size sport utilities, from either the inside or the outside, and the running boards electronically extend outward by four inches. Close the doors and the running boards retract beneath the vehicle.
7/18/2002	Ford Turns Profit in Quarter But Promises More Cost Cuts	The Ford Motor Company reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings today and a return to profitability after four quarters in the red. But the company said it expected to lose money in the third quarter and had not made enough progress on cutting costs.
7/18/2002	AUTO PARTS MAKER SETTLES DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION SUIT	The Visteon Corporation, a leading maker of auto parts, agreed to pay $415,000 to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The payment resolves E.E.O.C. claims that Visteon and its former parent, Ford Motor, refused to hire 11 job applicants based on pre-employment physical exams in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. The applicants had sought jobs at two Visteon plants in Michigan. Visteon was spun off from Ford in 2000. Visteon also agreed to spend $200,000 over the next five years to train employees on disability policies.
7/17/2002	Tax Breaks Are in Bill Closing Bermuda Loophole	A proposal to close a loophole that lets companies avoid taxes by acquiring a mailbox in Bermuda would force Boeing, Kodak, Disney and other large exporters to pay higher taxes, while giving new breaks to General Motors, Ford and other companies with factories overseas, supporters and critics of the plan said yesterday. The bill, which was introduced by House Republicans last week, would temporarily shut down a loophole that Stanley Works and other companies want to use to reduce or eliminate corporate income taxes by moving their nominal corporate headquarters to Bermuda, even while continuing to run their companies from offices in the United States.
7/17/2002	Canadian Auto Workers Open Talks With the Big 3	The union representing 46,000 Canadian auto workers began talks today with the big three North American automakers on a new labor contract that might set precedents for similar talks next year in the United States. There were signs that the local unit of General Motors would be the union's primary, and most accommodating, target. G.M., Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler all have closely integrated their American and Canadian operations, with assembly lines in each country producing vehicles for the entire North American market. But for the first time in many years, bargaining on labor contracts is not taking place simultaneously in the two countries.
7/10/2002	Ford Consolidates Land Rover Account	The Ford Motor Company is expanding its relationship with Young & Rubicam Advertising by shifting the North American account for Land Rover vehicles to the Irvine, Calif., office of Y.& R. from GSD&M in Austin, Tex. Spending was estimated at $50 million. The move had been expected because GSD&M, part of the Omnicom Group, was chosen as the North American agency for Land Rover under the previous Land Rover parent, BMW, which sold Land Rover to Ford just two months after signing a contract with GSD&M. The contract ran until December 2003, but a clause expired June 30, enabling Ford to dismiss GSD&M any time after that date provided 90 days' notice was given.
7/10/2002	FORD OPENS AN AUTOMOBILE ASSEMBLY PLANT IN RUSSIA	In another sign of increasing foreign investment in Russia, the Ford Motor Company announced the official opening of its assembly plant outside St. Petersburg. The factory will produce 25,000 Ford Focus cars a year for Russian consumers. The $150 million factory is the first car manufacturing plant in Russia that is fully owned by a foreign producer.

7/7/2002	Detroit's High-Speed Pursuit of the Police Car Market	BAD boys, bad boys, what you gonna do when a Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor rolls up behind you? Officers suggest that you pull over, if requested, even if you think your getaway car can outrun the Interceptor, with its 235-horsepower V-8. ''The Ford is quick enough to reach pursuit speed without sacrificing distance between you and the car you are going after,'' said Police Officer Greg Reynolds of Chicago. ''And it can maintain speed. It can cruise at 120 all day if you have to.''
7/5/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Russia: Ford To Open Car Plant	The Ford Motor Company will open a $150 million factory in Vsevolozhsk, Russia, next week to cut car prices, which are inflated by import duties. Oksana Khartonuk, a spokeswoman for Ford in Russia, said the factory would produce 8,000 Ford Focus models this year and would increase that to about 10,000 cars in 2003. The move is a sign that efforts by President Vladimir V. Putin to attract foreign investors are starting to pay off, as the country seeks to increase jobs and scrap Soviet-era factory technology.
7/4/2002	E-Commerce Executive Steps Down at Ford	The Ford Motor Company said today that its top electronic commerce executive was resigning Aug. 1 as the company reduces e-commerce activities to concentrate on its main business of making cars and trucks. The executive, Karen Francis, 39, a vice president, will ''pursue other opportunities'' and become a consultant to Ford on e-commerce activities, said Nick Sharkey, a spokesman. Ms. Francis was also president and chief executive of Ford's ConsumerConnect unit.
7/3/2002	G.M. Bucks Detroit Trend And Reports Higher Sales	A day after introducing an aggressive incentive plan, General Motors reported stronger June auto sales today even as sales by its Detroit-based rivals and the rest of the industry sagged. G.M. said its vehicle sales rose 4.3 percent in June compared with figures in the month a year earlier. Its market share climbed both for June and for the first half of 2001, thanks in part to its willingness to continue stimulating the market with incentives. In contrast, sales at DaimlerChrysler dropped 3.6 percent in June, while Ford Motor's sales dropped 10.7 percent.
6/20/2002	National Briefing | Southwest: Arizona: Questioning Safety Of Police Cars	Gov. Jane Hull has halted state purchases of Ford Crown Victoria police cruisers after the second police officer in five years was killed in a crash involving the vehicle. The state is also asking the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration to investigate the safety of Crown Victorias. The agency rejected a similar request by Arizona last year.
6/14/2002	G.M. Beat Ford in Efficiency, A Study of Auto Plants Finds	Last year, for the first time since a closely watched study began tracking productivity, General Motors was more efficient than the Ford Motor Company in building cars. But both companies, along with DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, continue to trail Asian competitors in productivity and profitability. The gap remains wide, even though the three major Asian automakers -- Toyota, Honda Motor and Nissan -- slipped a bit last year.
6/14/2002	World Business Briefing | Australia: Australia: Steel Strike Ends	BHP Billiton Ltd. said a 24-day strike at its Western Port factory ended, allowing its steel unit to resume supplies to customers including the automakers, Toyota, Ford Motor and Mitsubishi. The strike had curbed steel output at the BHP Steel plant and threatened to stop production at Australia's four biggest automakers. BHP Steel said it and the three unions involved reached a labor agreement without providing further details. BHP employs 1,380 people at its Western Port plant.
6/13/2002	The Sierra Club criticizes Ford's chief in a campaign for fuel-efficient cars.	THE Sierra Club introduced an advertising campaign yesterday that ties fuel economy to patriotism and calls for action by William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, who was once viewed by the group as an ally. The campaign, produced by Haddow Communications, is being rolled out in a dozen states. The campaign includes a radio spot and television ads featuring Bob Kerrey, the former Nebraska senator, and Jack Shanahan, a retired vice admiral. Both men urge the auto industry to take action to cut oil use.
6/12/2002	MERIT PAY IS DELAYED FOR FORD'S MIDLEVEL EMPLOYEES	The Ford Motor Company will delay merit raises for 47,500 midlevel salaried employees in North America until at least Aug. 1 as the company, the second-largest automaker, seeks to conserve cash. The raises would take effect after the company has had a chance to review second-quarter results fully, the chief operating officer, Nicholas Scheele, said in an e-mail message to employees. Ford previously delayed the increases from April until July 1, a spokesman, Nick Sharkey, said.
6/7/2002	FORD MOTOR NAMES A NEW EXECUTIVE FOR ITS LUXURY UNIT	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it had named Dan Werbin to lead the Volvo, Aston Martin, Land Rover and Jaguar brands in North America, changing management at a luxury unit that it sees as crucial in efforts to end losses. Mr. Werbin, 60, who has led Volvo's United States operations since November, will switch jobs on June 17 with Victor H. Doolan, who is the North American executive director of Premier Automotive Group, Ford's luxury unit. Mr. Doolan, 61, has led the unit in North America since July 1999. Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., has said that Premier, based in London, will generate a third of the automaker's profit by the middle of the decade.
5/31/2002	G.M. Rises and Nissan Falls in J.D. Power Quality Survey	General Motors rose to third place in this year's quality ranking surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, the best performance for a domestic manufacturer since the study's methodology was changed in 1998. The Ford Motor Company also rose in the closely watched initial quality survey, which examines how cars perform in their first 90 days, as did DaimlerChrysler, the parent of the Chrysler Group. Ford moved from seventh place to fifth in the survey. DaimlerChrysler moved from fifth to fourth.
5/30/2002	Western Companies Warm to Russia	The seals of approval are coming thick and fast for President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia these days. Today, the European Union said it would recognize Russia as a market economy, an upgrading of its status under the union's trade regulations and a designation that Moscow had sought for years. In a statement, Romano Prodi, president of the union's executive body, the European Commission, called it ''fit and proper'' that the 15-nation union ''reward the considerable efforts'' Russia has made to remake its economy.
5/21/2002	Executive Leaves Retirement to Help Ford	The Ford Motor Company announced today a management shuffle that included bringing back a retired executive to reprise his role as chief financial officer. In his first news conference as financial officer, the recalled executive, Allan D. Gilmour, 67, broke with Ford's criticism of the increase in spending on rebates and other incentives by the Big Three automakers. Ford and Chrysler have gone along with the price war, driven by General Motors, but they have complained about its effect on profits.
5/18/2002	Ford Is Said To Reappoint Ex-Executive	The Ford Motor Company, seeking to bolster its credibility on Wall Street, is set to elevate another experienced executive, this time from its past. Allan D. Gilmour, who retired as vice chairman of Ford in 1995 and once served as chief financial officer, will return to that job, according to several people who know of the decision. Mr. Gilmour, 67, will succeed I. Martin Inglis, a supporter of Jacques A. Nasser, the chief executive who was ousted last year.
5/13/2002	Industry Expertise Has Itself Become a Product	Knowing the best manufacturing tricks has always been a great way to maintain a competitive edge. These days, those same tricks may help bolster the bottom line. Consider these cases:
5/5/2002	Private Sector; Rising at Ford, Without Fanfare	MANY times over the last two years, Toshinori Kusuhashi looked up from the assembly line at Mazda Motor's Hofu factory in western Japan to see the company's energetic young American president, Mark Fields. Mr. Fields, 41, would show up without warning, and without an entourage, to walk the floor of the factory, considered one of the industry's most efficient, and to pick the brains of plant officials like Mr. Kusuhashi, the deputy general manager. The impromptu visits took some doing, since Hofu is two hours from Mazda's Hiroshima headquarters.
5/3/2002	FORD FOLLOWS G.M. IN BACKING OFF NO-INTEREST LOANS	Ford Motor joined General Motors yesterday in backing away from no-interest loans on new cars and trucks. Ford raised some cash discounts by $500 to $3,000, matching a level set by General Motors two days ago. Industrywide auto sales rose in April for the first time this year. The increased demand may help build profit at General Motors and cut losses at Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, analysts said. Ford's latest incentive program, which runs through July 1, continues the zero percent financing on some vehicles in some regions.
5/2/2002	Auto Sales Increased 2.9% in April; Only Ford Lagged	Every major automaker except Ford Motor reported sales increases last month, evidence of an economic recovery that helped propel the stock market today. Over all, automobile sales in the United States rose 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
4/30/2002	Auto Parts Makers Grinding to a Halt	For decades, Tom Libera stood securely on the first rung of the industrial ladder. Now he may be about to fall off. His small one-story shop, J & T Tool and Die, is surrounded by empty fields, at the base of Saginaw Bay just out of town. Inside, Mr. Libera, 43, shows off some of his wares -- basic elements of manufacturing that meld into the mechanisms of American life.
4/28/2002	Three Contemporary Riffs on an Old Cargo-Door Melody	SOMEWHERE, somebody in an automotive focus group sneezed, and now perfectly good words like ''hatchback'' and ''wagon'' are off the table, dicta non grata. For instance, Lexus calls the bobtailed wagon version of its IS 300 sport sedan the SportCross. ''We didn't think it was important to identify it as a wagon,'' said Ed Ohlin, corporate manager for product planning at Toyota and Lexus. ''And there was still some concern that it would be perceived as a hatchback.''
4/20/2002	Ford's Manager Of Luxury Division Is Resigning Post	The Ford Motor Company said today that the top manager of its luxury division had resigned and that it was rearranging the management structure of its Lincoln-Mercury unit. Wolfgang Reitzle, the vice president in charge of the Premier Automotive Group, resigned to become chief executive of Linde, a German industrial company. Mr. Reitzle, 53, a former BMW executive respected for his expertise in developing cars, will continue to work as a consultant with Ford. He will be succeeded by Mark Fields, 41, the chief executive of Mazda, which is controlled by Ford.
4/19/2002	As Other Pony Cars Eat Dust, the Mustang Roars On	FOR Brad Barnett, it all goes back to his childhood. ''When I was 3 years old, my dad bought a light blue 1973 Mustang coupe from my mother's sister,'' Mr. Barnett recalled recently. ''I told him I wanted the car to be mine and he promised it to me that day.'' Today, Mr. Barnett, now 23 and a manager at a technology company in Birmingham, Ala., runs two Web sites for devotees of the Ford Mustang, the larger of which (bradbarnett.net/mustangs) averages about 80,000 hits a month. He is also a member of the Magic City Mustangs, a Birmingham club where guys talk Stangs and sports and swap parts.
4/18/2002	Ford Motor Reports Fourth Consecutive Quarterly Loss	The Ford Motor Company reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss today, though its performance was better than analysts expected. The results were somewhat overshadowed by reports that a top executive was disgruntled and might leave the company. The executive, Wolfgang W. Reitzle, runs the Premier Automotive Group, Ford's luxury arm that oversees brands like Jaguar, Lincoln, Volvo and Aston Martin.
4/14/2002	Investing; Yellow Flag May Be Out for Parts Makers	STRONG car sales have propelled the shares of auto parts manufacturers, the mostly small to midsize companies that sell to giants like Ford and General Motors. As the broader stock market drifted sideways during the first quarter, the stocks of some of these companies rose 20 percent to 50 percent. As a group, auto parts makers are up 28 percent this year, as measured by the Dow Jones Auto Parts Index, which has risen 61 percent from its 52-week low on Sept. 21.
4/12/2002	Riding Into the Sunset On 300 Brawny Horses	EVER since I first saw the ''Drive the Big Rigs'' advertisement on a matchbook cover, I have wanted to know what it would be like to haul an 18-wheeler down the highway. Thanks to Ford's Super CrewZer, an $83,000, 23-foot-long behemoth of a truck with a 300-horsepower six-cylinder diesel engine offering 860 foot-pounds of torque, I have a pretty good idea. I had always thought of the people who drove really big trucks as professionals who knew all the best places to eat on the highway. But most Super CrewZers are sold to retirees who need to haul trailers across the country.
4/12/2002	SOME FORD RETIREES WILL PAY MORE FOR MEDICAL CARE	The Ford Motor Company told retired salaried employees in the United States yesterday that they would pay more of their health care costs starting in June as the company tries to return to profitability. The retirees, who do not pay a monthly premium now, may pay $5 to $150 a month depending on the number of people covered, their Medicare status and the coverage plan they select, a spokeswoman said. The change involves about 50,000 retirees and spouses, Ford said. Retired workers represented by the United Auto Workers are not affected.
4/10/2002	Ex-Ford Chief Received $23 Million in 2001	Jacques A. Nasser, the ousted chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, received a compensation package worth $23 million as part of his 2001 pay and retirement. The company lost $5.5 billion last year, its worst performance since 1992.
4/4/2002	HERTZ ELIMINATES BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS	Hertz, the car-rental company owned by Ford Motor, said yesterday that it had eliminated base commissions paid to North American travel agents on certain car rentals effective immediately. The move, which will mostly affect United States and Canadian corporate and government accounts with individually negotiated rate programs, was made because of continued weak travel demand and the need to further reduce costs, Hertz said in a statement. The change will not affect travel agency commissions for leisure car rentals, or for other business rentals. Hertz, based in Park Ridge, N.J., operates from over 7,000 locations in more than 150 countries.
4/3/2002	Auto Sales Strong in March as Recovery Continues	Solid auto sales in March pointed to a continuing economic recovery, though domestic automakers have not been able to break the cycle of losing market share to foreign competitors. General Motors, the healthiest of the Big Three automakers, was able to hold its share of the market steady in the first quarter, a victory compared with the struggles of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler. Analysts are growing bullish on G.M. because its sales have also become more profitable. Retail sales have risen while rental car companies and corporate fleets have cut back sharply on less lucrative bulk purchases during the downturn.
4/2/2002	FORD TO END PRODUCTION OF LINCOLN PICKUP TRUCK	Ford Motor said yesterday it would end production of the Lincoln Blackwood pickup truck this year after lower-than-expected demand and engineering delays. The Lincoln luxury division sold 379 of the 2002 rear-wheel-drive pickups from November through February. Analysts predicted sales of the Blackwood would reach as many as 8,500 for the 2003 model year beginning in July. The Blackwood was delayed five months, missing the chance to beat the General Motors entry, the Cadillac Escalade EXT, to showrooms. Blackwood sales were hurt because the pickup comes only in black, has a carpeted bed and lacks full-wheel drive for snowy climates, analysts said. Ford has built about 1,000 Blackwood pickups since beginning production last summer at a plant in Claycomo, Mo.
3/31/2002	TALKING AUTOS WITH: J Mays; Honk if You Love Spiffy Designs in Cars	JUST as there are people who can't tell a camshaft from a distributor cap, there are probably plenty who think that the Rust Belt is something one wears with a nice pair of jeans. The relationship between car culture and fashion has rarely been one that either party wanted to ventilate in public. Yet it is perfectly obvious that fashion evolution has tracked automobile design from the days when dusters and goggles were considered de rigueur while motoring in open-roof roadsters. Movies make it pretty clear that there has hardly been a major alteration in automobile design -- running boards, tail fins, convertibles, bucket seats -- that fashion designers have failed to notice. The citations could take you from here to the Ronkonkoma exit on the Long Island Expressway, but consider, for starters, such obvious examples of the relationship between how auto style and dress style mesh in ''Bullitt,'' ''Two for the Road,'' ''American Graffiti'' and anything on celluloid involving James Bond.
3/28/2002	Talking Green vs. Making Green	Before he became chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, William Clay Ford Jr. made a point of joining the environmental camp. Global warming, he wrote in a citizenship report in 2001, ''stands out from other environmental issues because of its potentially serious consequences and its direct relationship to our industry.''
3/26/2002	FORD EXPECTS TO MAKE A PROFIT IN 2ND HALF OF YEAR	Ford Motor will probably make a profit in the year's second half, its chief financial officer said yesterday. ''I would see us getting to some form of profitability'' in the second half, while losing money in the first quarter, the executive, Martin Inglis, said at a Morgan Stanley automotive conference in New York. Ford, which is based in Dearborn, Mich., is cutting jobs and closing plants after a 2001 loss of $5.45 billion, its first annual loss since 1992.
3/24/2002	The Cars That Car Designers Like to Look at	IF you want to rub elbows with automobile designers, there's no place like a car show to see the men and women who shaped the look and feel of the car in your driveway. But what do the designers themselves look at when they stroll the exhibition hall? The New York International Auto Show opens to the public on Friday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Earlier in the week, industry movers and shakers (and more than a few designers) will be on hand to unveil their latest dream cars (and real cars) to the press.
3/24/2002	Business; The New Accountability: Tracking the Social Costs	THE Enron-Andersen debacle has cast an unforgiving light on corporate bookkeeping, but the growing demand for accountability could extend far beyond financial statements. Pressure from investors, customers, consumer activists and even some governments is pushing more companies, particularly multinational ones, to report their nonfinancial performance, detailing the impact of their businesses on the environment and human rights. This so-called social reporting has been under way since the late 1980's, when corporations, reacting to the growing environmental movement, began publishing brochures about reducing pollution. But many of those early efforts produced little more than glossy propaganda.
3/22/2002	From Stops, Energy to Go	EVEN in a four-wheeled crowd, the Ford Mighty F-350 Tonka stands out. If you visit the New York auto show this year, you will find it hard to miss the brilliant yellow pickup, which measures 7 feet tall by 20 feet long and weighs more than 8,500 pounds. Its mammoth Mad Max design hints at the look of the next generation of Ford's mainstream F-Series trucks. Ford licensed the Tonka name for this concept vehicle because it liked the rugged appearance of the toymaker's sandbox miniatures, but this Tonka looks like a plaything for giants. With its huge 350-horsepower turbocharged diesel V-8, it will never be a poster truck for Greenpeace.
3/15/2002	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International; The Big 3 Sit and Honk Outside Korea's Garage	JAE H. JUNG doesn't look like a global warrior as he edges his black Lincoln LS sedan through the crush of midday traffic. But as the recently appointed president of the Ford Motor Company's Korean sales operation, Mr. Jung is storming the ramparts of a market in which 1.4 million cars were sold last year -- and in which Ford sold just 400. As he seeks to expand that nearly infinitesimal market share, he faces not only fierce cultural resistance to foreign cars, but complex import duties and ever-shifting safety and emission standards. ''It's a tough challenge,'' said Mr. Jung, 42. ''But I like it.''
3/10/2002	The Nation: Identity Crisis; Is Anyone Driving A Ford Lately?	THE Taliban drove Toyotas. They even drove some G.M. trucks. But they didn't drive Fords. These are not the best of times for the Ford Motor Company. Aside from losing $5.5 billion last year, Ford models are sinking on the wish lists of good guys and bad guys alike. The latest indignity came last month, when Ford, for the first time in a decade, was ousted by Chevrolet as the top-selling American automobile brand.
3/3/2002	Investing; Is It G.M.'s Turn to Be the Favorite?	AS it time to buy General Motors? For years, G.M. was deep in the woodshed of most professional investors. With its market share cut in half since 1960 and with cars described as bland at best, the company was not appealing.
3/2/2002	Chevrolet Sales Surpass Ford's For First Time In 10 Years	Chevrolet outsold the Ford brand in February for the first month in more than a decade, industry figures showed today, further highlighting the resurgence of the General Motors Corporation and the struggles of the Ford Motor Company. George Pipas, Ford's manager of industry sales analysis, said of G.M. during a conference call about February sales that ''I would say congratulations if they've managed to pull that off.''
3/1/2002	New Rule on Tire Safety Is Near, Government Says	The government is close to issuing a regulation that will require automakers to install tire-pressure warning systems in new cars and trucks starting with 2004 models, the Bush administration told a House subcommittee today. The rule is among tire safety measures ordered by Congress in 2000 after a spate of Ford Explorer rollovers were linked to the failure of Firestone tires. Investigation found that low pressure had contributed to the tires' shedding their treads.
2/24/2002	Station Cars, Batteries And Parking Included	TONI LUBETSKY of Chappaqua used to feed quarters into the parking meters at the Chappaqua train station each morning after driving around in search of a space. Now she pulls into a guaranteed parking spot and plugs in her brand-new electric car to a battery recharger. She has gotten used to people staring at the navy-blue, snub-nose vehicle, which is just under 10 feet long and a little more than five feet wide.
2/22/2002	A Le Mans Winner for the Masses	FORD said this week that it would build a new, street-legal version of its legendary GT40 racecar, which won the Le Mans 24-hour race four times in the 1960's, for sale to the public. The company showed a design study for an updated GT40, right, at Detroit's auto show last month. Ford did not disclose details or a price.
2/20/2002	The next spokesman to put a human face on Ford comes with a pedigree.	WILLIAM CLAY FORD JR. does not seem eager to join the ranks of Frank Perdue, Dave Thomas, Lee Iacocca and other top executives who have embodied their companies through advertising. ''I can't stand up there with a cigar and say, 'If you can find a better car, buy it,' '' he said yesterday at a news conference to introduce a new advertising campaign by Ford.
2/17/2002	Hot Dogs, Apple Pie and Toyota	IN the cafeteria, there are sticky rice and hush puppies, soy sauce and ketchup, chopsticks and forks. This is Toyota, bluegrass style.
2/16/2002	Linden G.M. Workers Take Wait-and-See Approach as They Face Layoffs	The last time there were layoffs at the General Motors Corporation plant here, Guy Messina, shop chairman of the union local, had to go onto the plant floor to answer questions about them. He was roundly booed by the members. On Thursday, when Mr. Messina joined other union and company officials to announce that 1,100 of the plant's 2,300 workers would be laid off by April 15, people were polite, and some even applauded.
2/14/2002	It's a First: A Creator of Cars Floors Them at Harvard	Automobile designers, long overlooked as the design profession's gasoline-fueled stepsiblings, are taking a seat alongside leading fashion, product and theater designers. At least that is the view of the Harvard Design School, which will for the first time honor an automotive designer, J Mays, with an award for excellence in design next Wednesday. Mr. Mays, 48, is in charge of design at the Ford Motor Company and an effusive design champion, in contrast to Detroit's usually low-profile designers. Cars like the red-hot 2002 Thunderbird, above, reflect his desire to put ''a spin on automotive design that is less pragmatic and more fantasy-based,'' he said. He does not conceal his disapproval of brands that lack what he calls the ''emotional connection.'' Two evocative concept cars, as well as models, renderings and historical documents, are included in ''Autoemotive,'' an exhibition of Mr. Mays's work, which is on view through April 7 at Harvard's Gund Hall Gallery in Cambridge, Mass. CHEE PEARLMAN
2/13/2002	Safety Agency Rejects Request To Investigate Ford Explorer	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration today denied a request by Bridgestone/Firestone to investigate safety defects in the Ford Explorer, saying crash data indicated that the Explorer was not markedly different from comparable sport utility vehicles. The decision was a victory for the Ford Motor Company and provided vindication for its claim that tread separation problems in Firestone tires, not in the Explorer, led to a higher than normal rate of fatal rollovers in the vehicles.
2/10/2002	Commercial Property/Midtown; A Dealership Redesigned to Allow Buyers Near Cars	IF the Manhattan Auto Group really wanted to hide its new-car showrooms from potential buyers, the current design of its building on 11th Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets could not be much better. The main entrance off 11th Avenue is primarily for cars, not people. Some vehicles are visible at the ground level, but there is no way for a potential customer to get to them and there are no salesmen stationed with them.
2/10/2002	Batteries Included	REID GOLDSMITH, a 47-year-old court reporter who lives in Syosset and works in Queens, used to start his day by watching commuters off the night shift wade bleary-eyed from the Hicksville train station platform to their parked cars. Before long, Mr. Goldsmith learned to identify the cars so he could position his station car, a gas-guzzling former police cruiser he bought at auction, to swoop into one of their spots and begin his train ride to Jamaica. But over the years Mr. Goldsmith found that the strategy isn't foolproof. In his worst months, he amassed as many as four parking tickets for illegal parking at the station. Mr. Goldsmith talked about the accumulation of tickets -- at $25 each -- as if it were a nasty cigarette habit. He swore the latest would be his last.
2/3/2002	Ford's Bet on Metals Prompts a Lawsuit	As if losing $1 billion on the trading of palladium and other precious metals isn't bad enough, now the Ford Motor Company faces a possible class-action suit. Last month, Ford executives disclosed the palladium write-down when they announced the company's turnaround plan. As part of the plan, which includes five plant closings and about 20,000 layoffs in America, Ford took a $4.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter, including $1 billion because of bad bets made on precious metals used in catalytic converters.
2/2/2002	Auto Sales Shrank 5.1% In January	Auto sales in the United States fell 5.1 percent in January compared with the month a year earlier and shrank even further from the strong sales at the end of last year as the enthusiasm for generous deals began to wane and the rental car industry continued to face problems. But the decline was less than many analysts and economists had feared, and some say 2002 could be better than expected.
1/29/2002	Ford Mustang Said to Have Failed Company Crash Tests	The Ford Mustang repeatedly failed the Ford Motor Company's internal crash tests for fuel tank integrity while it was being redesigned in the early 1990's, but it met broader company guidelines and the production version later passed government tests, according to a lawyer who obtained numerous internal Ford documents as part of a civil suit. Although Ford officials acknowledged that the Mustang did fail some tests, they strongly disagree there are any problems with the Mustang's design, pointing out that it passed a 1996 test conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They said the Mustang developed in the early 90's and sold between 1993 and 1998 met the company's fuel integrity guidelines when other tests, including computer simulations and laboratory tests on models, were factored in. And they said the Mustang's final crash test, conducted in December of 1992, was mistakenly reported in company documents as a failure and was corrected last year.
1/27/2002	McGreevey Cautious After Talks With Ford	While talks have begun with the Ford Motor Company, Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey is less than sanguine about the state's chances of keeping the Ford plant in Edison open. The governor, who made the retention of manufacturing jobs a cornerstone of his campaign, said Friday after meeting with Ford officials that he had stressed the state's strategic location. He said he told Ford officials, who plan to close the Edison plant in 2004, that low-interest loans and grants would be available if the company retooled the plant rather than closed it.
1/18/2002	Ford Lost $5.4 Billion in 2001 After Charge for Revamping	Ford Motor reported a $5.45 billion net loss for 2001 today, its first annual loss since 1992 and a long way from its $3.47 billion net profit in 2000. The huge loss was expected after Ford announced a turnaround plan last week that included job cuts of 35,000 workers and five plant closings by the middle of the decade.
1/12/2002	A Farewell to Fords With Stories: Luxe Continental to Buff Cougar	The four vehicles being dropped by the Ford Motor Company include some storied names, but none of them have sold well lately. The best known is the Lincoln Continental, which has a colorful history that goes back to the end of the Depression.
1/12/2002	FORD PLANS TO CUT 35,000 EMPLOYEES AND SHUT 5 PLANTS	The Ford Motor Company announced its most sweeping cutbacks in two decades today, terminating 35,000 workers, closing five plants and dropping four models. No longer will the company make Lincoln Continentals or Ford Escorts, as it cuts North American capacity by nearly a million cars and trucks a year.
1/12/2002	Plan to Close Ford Plant Means Upheaval for Many	Craig's Deli, with its coffee island and sizzling grill, could be seen as a canary in the economic mine shaft of this central New Jersey town of 100,000. It's not dead, but it's in trouble. In the last month, as the Ford Motor Company plant in Edison has cut its workers' schedules from 50- to 40-hour weeks, daily receipts at the deli have dropped about $200, a sizable chunk of the restaurant's revenues. Much of the 84 pounds of pork roll normally served every week at the deli has been left in the freezer.
1/12/2002	Bridgestone Settles Firestone Tire Lawsuit	The Bridgestone Corporation has settled a lawsuit related to its recalled tires, avoiding what would have been the company's first trial in the United States involving the tires. The Ford Motor Company and Bridgestone's United States unit, Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holding, agreed late Thursday to settle the suit, which had been scheduled for trial Monday in a state court in Wheeling, W.Va. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed.
1/12/2002	U.S. and Canadian Unions Look at Plans Differently	On the surface, the Ford Motor Company's plans to close five plants and eliminate about 15,000 hourly jobs in the United States and Canada seem like simply the latest in decades of auto industry cutbacks. But union officials and labor union experts said the move could mean a turning point for auto workers in the United States and Canada in their effort to stem job losses in the face of competition from foreign auto companies.
1/11/2002	Ford Is Said To Be Cutting Up to 15,000 More Workers	The Ford Motor Company's board agreed on a plan tonight to cut its work force by up to 15,000 hourly workers, in addition to the 5,000 salaried workers it said it would cut last year, and also close several of its plants, including a truck plant in Edison, N.J., according to a person close to the deliberations. The company will also reduce its worldwide capacity by one million vehicles, that person said.
1/6/2002	All That Easy Credit Haunts Detroit Now	WHEN the North American International Auto Show, the Cannes Film Festival of the auto industry, opens here today, the Ford Motor Company will put on a display of its new vehicles. The company hopes to make its mark with a redesigned version of its Expedition S.U.V. and a station wagon from its Volvo unit that looks like it wants to be an S.U.V. But the big news will come at the end of the week, after the show ends. That is when Ford is expected to announce a plan to return to profitability by reversing the company's declining quality, cutting costs and perhaps closing plants to ease overcapacity.
1/4/2002	Incentives Prop Up Sales but May Haunt Carmakers Later	Auto sales, propelled by low-cost financing, finished the year slightly below a record set in 2000, according to data released today. But expectations for 2002 are pessimistic because of the economy as well as the dent that the incentives have probably made in demand. Carmakers ended 2001 with sales of about 17.1 million vehicles, down slightly from the record 17.3 million in sales a year earlier. Few analysts expected such a strong performance last summer, when industry sales were lagging, and the Sept. 11 attacks all but halted showroom traffic.
12/28/2001	Driving a Bit of History: Watch Where You Step	IMAGINE flipping through the owner's manual for your new car and reading these instructions:
12/28/2001	What's New at Ford? Try the 2003 Model T	THEY say that history repeats itself, and in one quiet corner of the sprawling Ford Motor Company empire, that aphorism is literally true. Ford has resumed production of its legendary Model T, the car that put America on wheels, though the factory consists of a single large bay in one of the company's engineering buildings here, and the final assembly crew is just two workers.
12/18/2001	A Little Electric Car That Might; Gasless Vehicles Are Tested For Short Trips to Rail Stations	One morning next month, John Steward will get into his car, leave his house in White Plains and stop off at the Y.M.C.A. for a swim. Then he will drive to the Metro-North station and do a very strange thing. He will open the fuel flap on the side of his car. But there is no gas pump at the train station. So instead, Mr. Steward will plug a thick electric cord into the side of his car, as if it were a black, two-door toaster with tires and bucket seats. Then he will board his train for Grand Central Terminal, probably with a self-satisfied smile on his face.
12/14/2001	An Illinois Tire Plant Closes and a Way of Life Fades	Steve Collins is a skilled tire builder. For 17 of his 22 years at the Firestone plant here, he worked nights. His wife has not worked for 13 years, since the second of three children was born. On his wages, now $23 an hour or about $46,000 a year, he said, ''I built the house, got the toys -- the boat, the cars.'' But when the factory closes for good on Friday, Mr. Collins will be among 1,500 Firestone workers who will be out of jobs. When the last tire leaves the two-million-square-foot plant, Mr. Collins, 45, will be just three months short of the 23 years he needs for a full and immediate pension and lifetime health insurance.
12/13/2001	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Verizon Wireless To Offer Auto Services	Verizon Wireless is expected to announce today that it has reached an agreement to be the exclusive service provider for Wingcast, a company formed by Ford Motor and Qualcomm to provide a wireless service in automobiles. The agreement will permit Wingcast to offer consumers voice-activated services, including emergency phone calls, instant messaging, e-mail access and streaming video. Wingcast, based in San Diego, will make its service available in some Ford and Nissan vehicles next year. Simon Romero (NYT)
12/12/2001	Chauvinism on Wheels	To the Editor: So the Ford Motor Company will close its office that focused on marketing to women, which helped develop a minivan prototype that included a washer, dryer and microwave oven (Business Day, Dec. 11)? Sounds like progress to me! ELLEN D. MURPHY Brooklyn, Dec. 11, 2001
12/11/2001	Ford to Close Office Focused on Women	Ford Motor will eliminate a three-person office that helped look for ways to market vehicles to women, as the company restructures its North American business to reduce costs. The women's marketing and product office, which will close at the end of the year, was started seven years ago. It has suggested features like adjustable pedals and interior lights designed not to wake up babies. It also influenced the development of a prototype Windstar minivan that included a washer, dryer and microwave oven, said a spokeswoman, Paige Johnson. The prototype was unveiled last year.
12/9/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford King Ranch F-150 SuperCrew; Sizzle From a Branding Iron	COWBOYS and pickups go together like blue jeans and boots. It doesn't take an advertising genius to dream up a marketing tie-in that uses the rough-and-ready image of a cowpoke to sell a durable, utilitarian truck. But today, so many full-size pickups leave dealerships fully dressed, with prices well above $30,000, that a niche has opened up for for even fancier, more distinctive -- and, for automakers, more profitable -- pickups. The Lincoln Blackwood is one example, and the Cadillac Escalade EXT is on the way. GMC has a plush new truck, the Sierra Denali.
12/6/2001	Ford Puts 4th-Quarter Loss At Five Times the Forecast	The Ford Motor Company, the nation's second-largest automaker after General Motors, said yesterday that its loss for the fourth quarter would be five times greater than analysts had forecast. Ford officials blamed a tide of car repossessions and delinquent loans that resulted from the recession and rising unemployment. But financial analysts and professional investors openly questioned the company's overall strategy in a conference call and reiterated doubts about Ford's credit operations.
12/5/2001	Honda Opens a U.S. Factory and a Front Against the Big 3	Top executives of Honda Motor criticized the Big Three today for what they view as a double standard on fuel economy. The executives said that domestic manufacturers were not willing to face the environmental implications of becoming increasingly reliant on sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles. ''Business and some social obligation have to be equally applied to the whole company,'' said Koichi Amemiya, chief executive of Honda's American operations, who was in Alabama to open a minivan assembly plant.
12/5/2001	News of Ford Cutback Surprises Edison, Both Plant and Town	Many of the older workers at the Ford Motor Company plant remember 1982, when a poor economy and flagging demand for the Escort model assembled here led to a cutback to one daily shift, from two. So Monday, when veteran workers heard the surprising news that the same kind of cut, with the loss of 600 jobs, was planned for February, they reacted first with shock and indignation and then with sober and pointed questions about how long the cutbacks would last, the role of seniority and what benefits they would keep.
12/4/2001	Despite Ills, Automakers Report Solid Sales for November	Auto sales remained strong for much of November but began to slow after Thanksgiving, when the Big Three automakers started to restrict their interest-free financing offers. Still, the nation's auto industry remains on pace for what should be at least the third- or possibly the second-biggest sales year ever. General Motors said yesterday that it would increase first-quarter production by 7 percent to replenish a stock of vehicles diminished by record October sales and a strong November. G.M., the world's largest automaker, also said it would step up production by about 15,000 vehicles this quarter, and it said the increase would have a favorable effect on earnings projections.
12/3/2001	Ford to Cut Retirement Benefits And Insurance for Some Workers	The Ford Motor Company will announce plans later this week to slash 401(k) and health benefits for its salaried workers as part of an effort to overhaul its cost structure and return to profitability. Salaried workers will no longer receive one of the bull market's most coveted benefits, their 401(k) matching contributions. Ford had offered its salaried workers matching benefits of 60 cents for every dollar contributed to their 401(k) plans, for up to 10 percent of their salary.
12/2/2001	Private Sector; Planes, Heirs and Automobiles	THE gloomy day this past October was dampening the centennial celebration of Henry Ford's racing business. But Edsel B. Ford II, his great-grandson, was having a ball. He skittered around in a replica of the Sweepstakes, the two-cylinder 1901 car in which Henry Ford won a 10-lap race that helped to persuade investors to finance the Ford Motor Company. For the great-grandson, the replica car recreated a defining moment in his family's history, in which he takes an avid interest.
11/30/2001	Crash Test Raises Questions on 2 S.U.V.'s	A test released today by a research group financed by auto insurers raised questions about the design of two new sport utility vehicles. Results of a low-speed crash test, conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, subjected light trucks to four different five-mile-an hour collisions and tallied the cost of the damage done to their bumpers. The tests found that Chrysler's new Jeep Liberty and Ford's redesigned Explorer had bumpers that ''don't bump.''
11/28/2001	Vehicle Sales Stayed Robust In November	Auto sales have remained surprisingly strong this month easing the recession, economists say, and possibly shortening it, with automakers beginning to announce plans to increase production more than initially expected early next year to rebuild inventories. November's robust sales, after October's record pace, have been driven by a wave of interest-free financing offers from the Big Three, which have been good news for car buyers with good credit and have attracted many others to dealerships. And the incentives, by increasing consumer spending, have brought hopeful tidings to a bleak economy.
11/25/2001	'Type B' Chief Guides G.M. On a Course To Revival	EIGHT years ago, addressing an auto industry conference in Traverse City, Mich., Rick Wagoner strode from the lectern to the front of the stage. Mr. Wagoner, now the chief executive of General Motors, had just been named its head of purchasing, replacing Jos Ignacio Lpez de Arriorta, a storied executive who had forced steep price cuts and quality inspections on G.M.'s suppliers and, in the process, become a reviled figure in Motor City. The walk itself was a revolution -- G.M. executives do not leave the lectern. They remain behind it. They read from the script. They stay on point. Instead, Mr. Wagoner proceeded to admit to hundreds of suppliers that the company had not done a good job of explaining its new approach. He did not say he would scrap Mr. Lpez's tough reforms, but he did say G.M., the world's largest automaker, would repair the partnership.
11/24/2001	AUTOMAKER FORMS UNIT TO OVERSEE BRITISH-BASED BRANDS	The Ford Motor Company's Premier Automotive Group luxury division said it formed a strategy committee to oversee its British-based Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin brands in a move to bolster efficiency. The brands will combine legal, information technology and purchasing employees, the company said. The engineering work forces will remain mostly separate, it said. The realignment will not involve job cuts, the group said. It did not estimate potential cost savings.
11/23/2001	Fuel Targets for Sport Utilities Pose Difficulties for Automakers	Top executives of the Big Three automakers pledged anew in recent interviews to improve the fuel economy of their fleets of sport utility vehicles. But some of them are casting doubt on whether the goal set by Ford Motor last year -- a 25 percent improvement by 2005 -- can be met. Ford Motor pledged in the summer of 2000 to improve the fuel economy of its sport utilities by about 5 miles a gallon, from about 20 miles a gallon. That is well beyond federal standards, which have not been toughened significantly in more than a decade and require an automaker's fleet of sport utilities and other light trucks to average 20.7 miles a gallon. After Ford's move, General Motors and Chrysler responded not by specifying numerical goals of their own but rather by promising to match or beat Ford's gains.
11/23/2001	Bridgestone Tires Are Recalled in Brazil	Bridgestone/Firestone. said today that it recalled 48,000 tires fitted on vehicles made by Ford Motor sold in Brazil after identifying 16 cases in which the tires split. The recall applies to tires fitted on about 8,000 Ford F-350 and F-250 pickup trucks and sold from September 1999 to June of this year, the Brazilian division of Firestone, the United States unit of Bridgestone of Japan, said in a statement.
11/19/2001	Ford Motor Workers Get on the Job Training in Religious Tolerance	The Christians asked about fatwas, divine revelation and the promise of paradise for terrorists, while the Muslims listened. Both groups wore sport coats, work shirts or lab coats, and a few women came with heads covered. But they all carried the same storied emblem on their ID cards, the blue oval encircling the scripted Ford. Several hundred Ford Motor workers of many faiths and jobs -- engineers, designers, computer jockeys, plant foremen -- turned out today for ''An Islamic perspective on the events of Sept. 11.'' The event was sponsored by Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker and a company in a unique position since Sept. 11.
11/16/2001	Steering the Driver To Preferred Pit Stops	IN-CAR information services like the OnStar system from General Motors are starting to duplicate some of the Web's most useful offerings: driving directions, stock quotes, customized news and weather reports. Now, some of the companies behind these services are adding advertising and ''mobile commerce'' to the mix. The companies say their subscribers will not be subject to the dashboard equivalent of junk e-mail and annoying pop-up ads. Consumer concerns about privacy, along with the focus on driver distractions prompted by the spread of cellphones, mandate a conservative approach. But the possibilities may be too interesting to ignore.
11/15/2001	FORD IS EXTENDING INTEREST-FREE-LOAN INCENTIVES	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it had extended its interest-free loans on cars and trucks until Jan. 14, following its larger rival, the General Motors Corporation, on incentives that spurred record sales last month. Ford will offer the no-interest loans on all models except the Thunderbird car and Escape sport utility vehicle, said a spokeswoman, Susan Krusel. Even as Ford extended the offer, its chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., told a business group in Kansas City, Mo.: ''Maybe the first part of next year isn't going to be great for us. There is going to be a payback. Ultimately, we have to find a way to wean ourselves off this.'' Ford's shares fell 9 cents, to $16.34. The stock has declined 30 percent this year.
11/15/2001	A Ford Report to the S.E.C. Hints At Chief's Rich Severance Deal	The Ford Motor Company lifted the veil shrouding the severance agreement with its former chief executive, Jacques A. Nasser, yesterday, but only slightly. As expected, Ford's deal with Mr. Nasser, described in a 12-line exhibit attached to a required quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, included a noncompete clause.
11/14/2001	Restoring the Heart of Ford	In 1992, when Nicholas V. Scheele took the reins of the Ford Motor Company's recently acquired Jaguar luxury division, J. D. Power ranked the Jaguar's quality one notch above that of a Yugo. That's right, Yugo. The rickety car from the Balkans whose value doubled when you filled it with gas, according to one joke from the Yugo humor canon.
11/14/2001	FORD PERSUADES JUDGE TO REDUCE JURY AWARD TO VICTIMS	The Ford Motor Company persuaded a Florida judge to cut a $30.7 million jury award to the family of a child who was injured when the Ford van in which she was riding rolled over. The judge said that he cut the award to about $13 million after reviewing a recent Florida appeals court ruling on damages and jurors' finding that the girl was 50 percent responsible for her injuries by not wearing a seat belt. ''This is a reminder from the court that seat belts can help protect passengers only when they are worn,'' said Kathleen Vokes, a Ford spokeswoman. Mary Phyllis Jimenez, 12, was hurt in May 1999 after her family's Ford Econoline van rolled over after a tire blew out. One person died in the wreck. Ms. Jimenez suffered brain damage.
11/10/2001	GRANDDAUGHTER OF FOUNDING FAMILY GETS CRUCIAL JOB	Another member of the founding family has landed a new job at the Ford Motor Company. Elena Ford, 35, a granddaughter of the former chief executive Henry Ford II, was named group brand manager of Mercury, a spokeswoman, Nancy Carollo, said yesterday. The appointment was one of four that Ford, the No. 2 automaker, has made in its Lincoln Mercury division, based in Irvine, Calif. Ms. Ford had been director of e-solutions in Ford's marketing department, a position related to Internet ventures. William Clay Ford Jr., a nephew of Mr. Ford, was named chief executive last week.
11/9/2001	FORD MOTOR NAMES SEVERAL EXECUTIVES TO NEW JOBS	The Ford Motor Company named three group vice presidents yesterday, as the new chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., began installing his own team. Roman Krygier, 58, was named group vice president to oversee production and standards, a spokesman said. David Thursfield, 56, will also become a group vice president, but will remain chairman, president and chief executive of Ford of Europe. Martin Zimmerman, 55, was named group vice president for corporate affairs. He had been vice president for governmental affairs. Ford also named seven vice presidents, including one in charge of human resources, and appointed a product chief for its most profitable luxury models.
11/8/2001	Firestone Said to Reach Tire Settlement	The Bridgestone/Firestone Corporation will pay $41.5 million to avert state lawsuits over millions of tires recalled last year, a person close to the settlement talks said today. The announcement is expected to be made on Thursday. The company declined to comment tonight.
11/8/2001	Changing of Guard at U.A.W.	Ron Gettelfinger, the union executive who negotiated a spinoff of Ford's auto supply business on exceedingly generous terms for its workers, is expected to be nominated as the next president of the United Automobile Workers on Thursday, several people close to the deliberations said today. But because the selection is made by a secret ballot of 19 top officials, surprises are possible. Mr. Gettelfinger, 57, who is the U.A.W. vice president in charge of relations with Ford Motor, is running against Richard Shoemaker, 62, the vice president who oversees U.A.W. relations with General Motors. Stephen P. Yokich, 66, the U.A.W.'s current president, has passed the union's retirement age of 65 and will depart when his term ends next year.
11/7/2001	FORD REDUCES PAYMENTS TO CONTRACT WORKERS	The Ford Motor Company will reduce payments to contract workers by 7 percent as it cuts costs to stem losses. The reduction takes effect Nov. 19, and the contractors were notified last month, a spokeswoman said. The automaker uses about 6,000 contract workers for tasks like computer programming, parts design and clerical work. Ford lost a total of $1.44 billion in the second and third quarters as it paid for replacing 13 million Firestone tires, spent more on marketing and reduced production because of lower demand. Ford shares rose 20 cents, to $16.38. The stock has declined 30 percent this year.
11/4/2001	The Glorious, the Gaudy: 5 Decades of T-Birds	THE lights dim, the curtain rises and glamorous fashion models pull the wraps off the retro-styled, nostalgia-inducing 2002 Ford Beaver. Doesn't sound right, does it? Yet the name of nature's dam builder was once considered for the car now known as the Thunderbird, whose rich history reaches back to the 1955 model year. Or the T-Bird might have been called the Detroiter, a name whose luster faded as the fortunes of the Motor City declined. And another label once considered, the Hep Cat, would seem as hip today as ''23 skidoo.''
11/3/2001	CAR MAKER'S ATLANTA PLANT TO IDLE 2,100 WORKERS	The Ford Motor Company will close an Atlanta car plant for a week starting on Monday, idling about 2,100 workers, to reduce production because of lower orders from rental-car companies and businesses. The plant makes the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans. United States auto sales surged 24 percent last month, and Ford's sales nationwide rose 36 percent in October, helped by no-interest loans. Orders from rental-car companies and businesses looking to add to fleets slid 30 percent last month and have been declining since July as a slowing economy reduces travel demand and prompts companies to scale back on purchasing, a Ford sales analyst, George Pipas, said.
11/2/2001	Vehicle Sales for October Were Highest Ever in U.S.	Sales of cars and trucks in the United States soared to the highest monthly level ever in October, automakers reported today, but they were spurred by deep discounts that foreshadow trouble in the months ahead. Despite an economy in recession, rising unemployment and shaken consumer confidence, vehicles sold at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 21.26 million last month, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data service in Southfield, Mich. That tops the previous high of 21.24 million, reached in September 1986. Sales for the entire year are expected to finish above 17 million vehicles.
11/2/2001	Better Cars, Cleaner Air	As chairman of the Ford Motor Company, William Clay Ford Jr. said all the right things about the environment. As its new chief executive officer, he'll have the power to put his words into action. His challenge is to prove that an enlightened executive can turn Ford into a responsible corporate citizen. Unlike many other corporate executives, Mr. Ford not only recognizes how his business harms the environment; he admits it and says he wants to fix the problems. His tenure offers real hope for progress on issues like global warming.
11/1/2001	Left in Nasser's Exhaust at Ford	Jacques A. Nasser, Detroit's New Economy chief executive officer, lasted longer than the new economy. But not much. Mr. Nasser, who resigned as chief executive of the Ford Motor Company on Monday, had bold ideas, and many good ones. He worked his way up through Ford's international divisions and was a turnaround expert nicknamed Jac the Knife for his cost cutting. He presented himself as a chief executive in the mold of John F. Welch Jr., with a dash of Michael S. Dell. Like those men, he had no chief operating officer and chafed at delegating authority.
10/31/2001	Ford Family Takes the Helm; Effort to Overcome Rift At Troubled Company	The Fords, one of the most prominent and enduring families in American business, reasserted control today of the Ford Motor Company for the first time in more than two decades. But William Clay Ford Jr. -- the family member who took over as the company's sole chief executive, ending an awkward power sharing arrangement with the ousted Jacques A. Nasser -- assumes leadership of a company mired in deep trouble.
10/31/2001	2 New Top Executives Ready to Share Management Load	In his first act as chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, William Clay Ford Jr. named a pair of seasoned executives to run the company's automotive and financial operations, a clear signal he will not hesitate to seek out experienced help. Mr. Ford named Carl E. Reichardt, the retired chief executive of Wells Fargo & Company, as vice chairman, with sweeping responsibilities over Ford's financial, leasing, credit and rental car operations. Nicholas V. Scheele was named Ford's chief operating officer and president of the Ford Automotive Group, becoming Ford's key executive on the vehicle side.
10/30/2001	Ford Chief Is Reported to Resign; Will Be Replaced by Family Heir	The chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, Jacques A. Nasser, has resigned, according to a person close to the company. William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of Ford and the great-grandson of Henry Ford, will take over as chief executive. The move will be announced today.
10/26/2001	Ford Settles Ignition Suits By Extending Warranties	A California judge yesterday approved a proposal by the Ford Motor Company to settle lawsuits in five states by reimbursing current and former owners who replaced flawed ignition systems on millions of cars and trucks. Ford reached the agreement with plaintiffs in the case in August. The accord was formally presented to Michael E. Ballachey, the California judge who was preparing to begin hearings to assess damages that could have totaled billions of dollars.
10/24/2001	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Booming Car Sales, but at a Price	Corporate earnings are plummeting, unemployment is rising, consumer confidence is shaky, the country is at a war footing at home and abroad. Yet auto sales have rarely been better. Come again?
10/21/2001	Private Sector; Ford Has a Better Idea: Party Now	Reports are rife in Detroit that Jacques Nasser, the embattled chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, will be gone by year-end. But Mr. Nasser plans to keep one date: Ford's annual holiday party for the news media. Last week, even as articles about Mr. Nasser's possible ouster were circulating, auto-industry journalists received cream-colored cards that read, ''You are invited to join Jacques Nasser at the annual News Media Holiday Reception'' on Monday, Nov. 26. The party will be held at Fairlane, the estate of Ford's founder, Henry Ford, the first time that Ford has used the house for the event.
10/21/2001	Ghosts of Christmas Past: The Wait for T-Birds Goes On	JOE KAMINKOW'S father, Arnold, fell in love with the latest Thunderbird the moment he saw photos of the concept car that Ford displayed at the 1999 Detroit auto show. So when Mr. Kaminkow heard last year that Neiman Marcus would feature the T-Bird in its Christmas 2000 catalog, he vowed to snag one for his dad. With help from family and friends -- who dialed in from home phones, cell phones and even a fax line -- Mr. Kaminkow landed one of the 200 black and silver T-Birds that Neiman Marcus put up for sale a year ago last month. The catalog's fine print promised that deliveries would start in June 2001. So Mr. Kaminkow, vice president for engineering and design at International Game Technologies, a slot machine maker, planned a summer drive in the car from Boston, where his father lives, to his home in Reno.
10/20/2001	Ford Motor Cancels Program To Give PC's to Its Employees	The Ford Motor Company today canceled its program to give employees personal computers as the company tries to reduce expenses because of slowing sales and financial losses. Ford had distributed about 166,000 personal computers and printers to employees from February 2000 until the end of May, when the program was deferred until the fourth quarter. At the time, Ford said there had been questions about how the giveaway affected taxes for workers in different nations.
10/18/2001	G.M. Extending Incentives As Ford Posts Another Loss	General Motors today extended interest-free financing deals on its vehicles through mid-November, escalating a price war with the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group that began last month. There were signs today that the rising incentive costs were taking their toll. Ford reported a third-quarter net loss of $692 million, posting a second consecutive quarter of losses for the first time in nearly a decade. The loss was in line with analysts' estimates.
10/16/2001	Debt Downgrade For Ford, G.M.	Standard & Poor's lowered the credit ratings of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company as competition from overseas rivals reduced profit. The Toyota Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and some other Asian automakers have followed the United States companies and have begun offering no-interest loans to encourage sales.
10/16/2001	Ford Denies Top Executive Will Leave by Year's End	Jacques A. Nasser, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, will probably be out of a job by the end of the year, according to a person close to the company. Ford officials dismissed that suggestion, however.
10/11/2001	A Buyer's Market for Autos Is a Tough Development for Chrysler	Dieter Zetsche is holding an arm's length pair of cardboard scissors. The Romeo High School band has played ''The Star Spangled Banner.'' A big American flag is unfurled into a cloudy sky. Veterans salute and a pastor prays. Now it's time for Mr. Zetsche, the chief executive of the Chrysler Group, to cut the big red ribbon stretching over the entrance of Orchard Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, a new dealership nestled next to a Fashion Bug and a Farmer Jack, several miles north of Detroit. For Mr. Zetsche, 48, an affable, slim German with small, rounded glasses perched over a walrus mustache, cutting the ribbon is the easy part.
10/10/2001	When More Options Are Standard, the Choices Boil Down	THERE was a time, when the moving assembly line was young, that all cars were built pretty much the same way and all the customer could choose was the body style and the number of doors. Almost every item of optional equipment, from radios and heaters to rear-view mirrors and spare-tire covers, was arranged for and installed by the selling dealer. In today's market, with as many as 17 million new cars and trucks sold each year, even small, inexpensive cars come with power steering, power brakes with anti-lock systems, power windows, power mirrors, power locks, automatic transmission and AM/FM/CD sound systems. The reason is simple: economies of scale mean it's easier and cheaper for factories in the United States, Japan, Korea and Europe to build them that way. And customer expectations of what is standard have risen to this level.
10/10/2001	Worried Carmakers Appeal to Patriotism and Pocketbooks	AS the 2002 model year begins, the timing could hardly be more challenging for automobile manufacturers. Thanks to slow summer sales, an even slower economy and post-Sept. 11 jitters, dealer lots are jammed with last year's cars. While such circumstances usually cry out for aggressive marketing, advertisers are wary of offending the public with pitches that might appear insensitive during a time of mourning and reflection. How does an automaker move cars off the lot in such an atmosphere? For some, the answer is to change nothing and hope for the best. For others, the solution is to mix financial incentives with a healthy dose of patriotism. That is what America's big three carmakers are doing, in addition to continuing all the regular new-model advertising they had planned before Sept. 11.
10/7/2001	Hiring a Stretch For 30 cents Per 1/5 Mile	TO make the point that its 2002 Mountaineer is intended for city dwellers, Mercury broadcast television commercials last spring that showed the redesigned sport utility winding through city streets, including those of Manhattan. The Mountaineer rolls by skyscrapers, including the World Trade Center, in a spot that stopped running long before the twin towers fell on Sept. 11. The camera focuses skyward from the windshield to capture an expanse of the Brooklyn Bridge. Streets teem with schoolchildren, teachers, police officers and ambulance drivers. The spots emphasize a sense of security with taglines like ''Strength Lives Here,'' ''Peace of Mind Lives Here'' and ''Safety Lives Here.''
10/7/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Mercury Mountaineer; An Image in Tune With the Times	DAIMLERCHRYSLER killed Plymouth, and General Motors pulled the plug on Oldsmobile. But Mercury, another auto nameplate with declining sales and a murky image, is hanging on. The Ford Motor Company insists that it will not abandon Mercury, which historically filled the gap between blue-collar Fords and black-tie Lincolns. Industry experts often speculate that Mercury, whose dealers also carry Lincolns, will be the next automobile brand to be eliminated. They note that Mercury missed the industry's boom of the 1990's and that its product lineup seems confused, from the avant-garde Cougar coupe to the staid Grand Marquis sedan.
10/7/2001	Ford Insists Mercury Will Endure	The Bridgestone Corporation said its Firestone subsidiary in the United States would probably replace fewer than 400,000 tires, about half of those covered under its latest recall, because most of the affected tires are already off the roads. Japan's largest tire maker said it would spend about $30 million to replace the tires. Ken Belson (NYT)
10/6/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Fewer Tire Replacements Expected	Bowing to pressure from the government, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. said yesterday that it would recall and replace an additional 3.5 million Wilderness AT tires. As a result of its action, the company said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was closing a year-and-a-half investigation into thousands of reports that the tires suddenly lost their tread.
10/5/2001	Firestone Will Recall an Additional 3.5 Million Tires	The United Auto Workers thought that the Nissan workers in Smyrna, Tenn., would be the ones to finally unionize a foreign automaker's plant and provide a crucial first step in turning the U.A.W.'s fortunes around. Instead, the union was dealt a bitter defeat on Wednesday in a battle it had expected to win, or at least closely contest. The margin of defeat has surprised the auto industry and labor unions alike. Nissan employees rejected U.A.W. representation by a 2-to-1 vote, no better than in the union's failed attempt to organize the same plant in 1989.
10/3/2001	Auto Sales Off in September, But Less Than Expected	United States auto sales slumped last month, but were better than analysts expected. A drought in auto sales after the attacks has already led to additional belt-tightening for an industry that was trimming as the economy worsened. Now, analysts say demand will plunge more sharply, leading to more production cuts, plant closings and layoffs.
10/3/2001	Ford to Settle E.E.O.C. Suit	Ford Motor failed to punish a white worker who discussed ''lynching'' in front of black workers, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says in a discrimination lawsuit against the company. The white employee's comment in 1999 that it was a ''good day for a lynching,'' as well as the hanging of a noose and offensive use of black slang, were cited in the lawsuit as examples of a hostile workplace for black workers at Ford's New Model Program Development Center in Allen Park, Mich.
9/22/2001	Arab-Americans Are Finding New Tolerance Amid the Turmoil	Before the e-mail note that explained how a ''good Arab'' is a dead one buried in pigskin, before the bomb threat that briefly closed his office and before young white men in a car threatened to kill him, Ismael Ahmed got an urgent telephone call. The chairman of the Ford Motor Company, William Clay Ford Jr., wanted a meeting.
9/6/2001	Ford Said to Be Considering Merging Engineering Operations	Ford Motor may merge its North American car and truck engineering operations as part of its efforts to cut costs, The Detroit News reported earlier today. Ford directors were expected to approve the plan when they met today, The News reported.
9/5/2001	Detroit's Big Three May Shuffle as Chrysler Struggles	General Motors. Ford. Toyota? The overseas assault on Detroit's Big Three continued yesterday as the Chrysler Group reported that its August sales fell 24 percent from the year-earlier period. That surprised analysts and led some to wonder if the continuing sales gains by Toyota Motor would lead it to become the nation's third-largest automaker, vaulting past Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
8/31/2001	Auto Parts du Jour; Suppliers Are Forced To Learn Flexibility	Long before she receives the latest orders from General Motors and other big customers, Bonnie Sliker has a pretty good idea what they are going to say. Ms. Sliker, general supervisor of the orders and scheduling group at the big Delphi Automotive Systems parts plant in Rochester, makes her own projections by reading trade journals, talking to her contacts throughout the industry and even by watching television news.
8/31/2001	When Hot Cars Go Cold	THE Lexus SC 430 is the chief object of automotive desire this summer. Demand is high, supplies are short and dealers are charging thousands of dollars over the $60,000 sticker. But to Jay Shoemaker, the elegant convertible is old news. Mr. Shoemaker of San Francisco got his SC 430 in March, and he has already sold it, pocketing $8,000 in profit. When he ordered the car in December 1999, he was the second person on Lexus's waiting list.
8/30/2001	Ford Motor Will Not Pay Annual Bonus To Managers	The Ford Motor Company, which is struggling with falling auto sales and the Firestone tire recall, said today that it would not pay bonuses this year to 6,000 middle-level and senior managers, including its chief executive, Jacques A. Nasser. This would be the first time since 1992 that Ford has not paid bonuses to executives. The announcement came months earlier than usual for major corporations to act on executive compensation. Most companies generally do not decide the level of executive bonuses until late in the fourth quarter, when they are able to gauge full-year financial results.
8/30/2001	Playing With Consumers	EVEN on a modest computer, the revving of the virtual racing car's engine stirs anticipation. The car, low-slung and rendered for speed, glistens under a digitally created sky that is forever high noon. It's the online computer game Dodge Speedway. With the click of a mouse, a player is behind the wheel and joining other racers jostling their way around a skid-scarred track to a throbbing soundtrack of techno music.
8/25/2001	Firestone Set to Pay $7.5 Million in Suit	Bridgestone/Firestone has agreed to pay $7.5 million to the family of a woman who was paralyzed and suffered brain damage during a rollover crash in a Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle, settling the first of hundreds of defective-tire lawsuits to go to trial since the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires a year ago.
8/25/2001	Firestone Set to Pay $7.5 Million in Suit	Bridgestone/Firestone has agreed to pay $7.5 million to the family of a woman who was paralyzed and suffered brain damage during a rollover crash in a Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle, settling the first of hundreds of defective-tire lawsuits to go to trial since the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires a year ago.
8/22/2001	Texas Jurors Deliberate in First Tire Lawsuit Since Big Recall	In the first trial after the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires last year, jurors began deliberating this afternoon whether a tire made by Bridgestone/ Firestone Inc. was to blame for a crash in March 2000 that left a 39-year-old woman paralyzed and brain-damaged. The outcome of the closely watched case, before a nine-member jury in federal court here, could foreshadow Firestone's ability to battle a number of other defective-tire lawsuits and show whether its attempts to shift blame for crashes involving its tires to the Ford Motor Company will be accepted by jurors. About 200 people have died and hundreds of others have been injured in vehicles equipped with Bridgestone/Firestone tires, many of them on Ford Explorers.
8/22/2001	GENERAL MOTORS AFFIRMS PROFIT OUTLOOK	The General Motors Corporation has affirmed its third-quarter profit outlook and production for the year, four days after the Ford Motor Company lowered its earnings forecast. Third-quarter profit at G.M. will be about 83 cents a share and production is expected to remain at about 1.23 million units, the company said. G.M. is forecast to earn 81 cents a share. Ford said on Friday that it would cut as many as 5,000 salaried jobs and earn about 70 cents a share this year, below the average forecast.
8/19/2001	A New Car Phone (No Strings Attached)	FOR most of the past decade, Cellport Systems has been researching and developing a safer way for motorists to talk on their wireless phones while on the road. Sure, there are headsets and other devices on the market that allow people to talk and keep both hands on the wheel, but critics say that those, too, can pose safety problems. Now, as public sentiment grows against the use of hand-held cellular phones while driving, Cellport finds itself in the spotlight with its next generation of hands-free, headset-free technology. Drivers use simple voice commands to operate the phone, while the sound is channeled through the car's speakers. And Cellport's system is compatible with most major brands of cell phones.
8/19/2001	Private Sectors; Lean and Mean but Green	The Ford Motor Company has been in the news lately over safety issues, declining sales and job cutbacks because of the weak economy. But William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman, at least wants Ford to be known as the car company that saved Detroit from drying up. With the Detroit area gripped by drought, Ford Motor has stopped watering the lawns at 17 Michigan factories and cut back on car washes for executive and company cars. The moves saved 500,000 gallons of water a day.
8/18/2001	FORD TO CURTAIL AUTO PRODUCTION AND CUT 5,000 JOBS	The Ford Motor Company said today that it was eliminating 5,000 salaried jobs in North America and planned to reduce production this fall, the latest signs that the auto industry may no longer be able to prop up the stumbling American economy. The Standard & Poor's credit agency responded to Ford's moves by warning that even more drastic measures were needed. S.& P. said it was preparing to downgrade the credit ratings of both Ford and General Motors -- a reflection of Wall Street's worries about the domestic carmakers' high costs and the growing market share of import brands.
8/17/2001	Testing the Waters at a Gay Dealership	DENNIS LYNCH and his partner, Philip Hinkenach, needed a car but dreaded the buying process. Then Mr. Lynch saw an advertisement in a local gay magazine, Frontiers, announcing that Beverly Hills Ford had set up a showroom and lot on Olympic Boulevard with an all-gay sales staff. The next day, the men paid a visit and drove home in a white Mercury Sable.
8/17/2001	Ford Weighs Plans to Cut White-Collar Work Force	Alarmed by the slowing economy and a slumping market share, executives of Ford Motor have approved an early-retirement program for up to 10 percent of its white-collar employees in the United States, or 4,600 workers, people close to the company said today. Ford's management has also begun reviewing the possible delay of some planned vehicle models, which would lower the company's design and engineering costs, and has even started considering whether to shut down an assembly plant, these people said. But only the early-retirement plan appears imminent, they said, partly because Ford has only just installed a new group vice president for North American operations, Nick Scheele, who has begun a comprehensive review of the automaker's activities in the region.
8/13/2001	Settlement Seen By Ford in Suits Over Ignitions	The Ford Motor Company has reached a preliminary agreement to settle lawsuits in five states by paying to replace defective ignition systems in millions of cars that, many owners said, could stall, often on highways, across railroad tracks and in other dangerous situations. People involved in the case said that the tentative agreement was reached last week and would be formally presented today to a California judge, Michael E. Ballachey, who was preparing to begin hearings to assess damages that could, under the state's laws, have totaled billions of dollars.
8/11/2001	MERGING OF LUXURY-VEHICLE OPERATIONS IS PLANNED	Ford Motor will merge the North American business operations of its Aston Martin, Jaguar and Land Rover brands on Sept. 1 as part of an effort to raise sales of the luxury vehicles. The new organization, which is part of Ford's Premier Automotive Group, will perform sales, marketing and dealer relations for all three brands. Mike O'Driscoll, president of Jaguar North America, was named president of the merged group. Ford wants to expand sales of luxury vehicles, which have high profit margins. . Jaguar and Land Rover sold about 37,000 vehicles combined in the United States through July. The leading luxury brands, the Lexus from the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan and the BMW cars from Germany, each sold more than 126,000 vehicles in the period, according to the Autodata Corporation.
8/7/2001	GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATES SEAT BELTS ON FORD S.U.V.'S	Ford Motor's Explorer sport utility vehicle, already involved in a tire-safety inquiry, is being investigated to see whether a third rear-seat safety belt is needed following reports of 10 deaths in accidents, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. The agency is investigating the two-door Explorer Sport and Mercury Mountaineer S.U.V.'s, an agency spokesman, Rae Tyson, said yesterday. Sometimes a third person will sit in the rear seat, which Ford says is designed for two people. The agency has reports of 11 crashes involving the 10 deaths and 20 injuries, he said. ''There's a seat belt for every seating position,'' said Sara Tatchio, a spokeswoman for Ford, adding that Ford provided information sought by the traffic agency in mid-July.
8/5/2001	Turning Heads Back To Detroit	CHEESY?'' said J Mays, design director for the Ford Motor Company. ''Absolutely.'' Mr. Mays had just screened a commercial for the 2002 Thunderbird in the auditorium of the Media Lab -- the research center for avant-garde techies and other futurists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Besides the usual speeding-on-desert-highway scenes, the ad dripped with nostalgic soft-focus evocations of the T-Bird's happier days: diners and Elvis and whatnot.
8/2/2001	Domestic Auto Sales Fell 6% in July	Auto sales in the United States fell 6 percent in July as the slowing economy and the continued struggles of domestic automakers dampened sales. The falloff from figures in the month a year earlier comes after a surprisingly strong first half of the year that surpassed expectations.
7/25/2001	A Continental Tire Is Under Scrutiny	One model of tire that the Ford Motor Company is using to replace Firestone Wilderness AT's has a higher rate of damage claims than the Firestones do, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today as it opened a defect inquiry into the tire. The tire in question, the General Ameri*550 AS, made by Continental, has caused 7 crashes, including 2 rollovers, with 17 injuries, the traffic agency said. But it warned that the inquiry did not mean the tires were dangerous.
7/22/2001	Private Sector; Comfortable With the Fast Track	AS a 15-year-old racing fanatic, Anne Stevens longed to hang out with the mechanics in the pits at the stock car races near her home in Reading, Pa. But girls weren't allowed. So she borrowed a baggy shirt and trousers, tucked her hair under a cap and finagled her way in. ''If you looked dirty, they didn't bother you,'' she recalled.
7/20/2001	U.S. May Order Mandatory Recall of Some Firestone Tires	The Transportation Department said today that it had asked Bridgestone /Firestone to recall additional tires but the company insisted its tires were safe and said it would state its case at a public hearing and in court. As a result, the government said it would start a proceeding to begin a mandatory recall, only the 10th time since 1966 that it has done so. The effectiveness of the process is not clear, because it could take years, longer than the lifetime of the tires. It could also give a forum to accident victims, experts predicted.
7/19/2001	Ford Says $752 Million Loss Is Mostly From Tire Costs	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it had lost $752 million, or 41 cents a share, in the second quarter, mostly because of costs associated with replacing 13 million Firestone tires as well as reorganization charges at the Mazda Motor Corporation. The loss was somewhat narrower than Wall Street analysts had been expecting. But the various charges did not mask a difficult environment for Ford.
7/17/2001	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Ford Offers Phone System	The Ford Motor Company, the No. 2 automaker, will begin offering a hands-free, voice-activated system in some vehicles this year to enable drivers to use cellular phones more safely. Cellport Systems Inc. of Boulder, Colo., will supply the system, the Cellport 3000 with Voice Command, under a $48 million contract, said Ralph Poplansky, Cellport's vice president of product development. Last month, New York became the first state to ban the use of cell phones by drivers unless they use headsets or hands-free devices such as Cellport's. The Cellport 3000 will first be sold as a dealer-installed option on Taurus sedans and Windstar minivans and will be offered in most Ford vehicles by mid-2002, a Ford spokeswoman, Della DiPietro, said.
7/13/2001	Ford Changes Some Managers In Its North American Division	The Ford Motor Company, buffeted by lower auto sales and the continuing dispute over the failure of Firestone tires on its Explorer sports utility vehicles, announced a series of management changes today to shore up its operations in North America. The moves, which followed a meeting of Ford's board on Wednesday, had been expected and Ford stock did not react. The actions did not involve Jacques A. Nasser, the chief executive of Ford, who has borne the brunt of criticism in the aftermath of Ford's recent troubles.
7/12/2001	Ford Is Changing the Way It Rates Work of Managers	The Ford Motor Company told employees on Tuesday that it was changing a performance ranking system for managers that had become the subject of a growing number of lawsuits. In a message sent to Ford employees, Jacques A. Nasser, the company's chief executive, said that Ford was altering its year-old performance evaluation system that graded managers and supervisors according to a letter-based ranking system.
7/11/2001	Technology Briefing | Internet: Autotrader In Deal With Ford	The Ford Motor Company's FordDirect.com Internet sales venture with dealers will use the classified advertising Web site AutoTrader .com to manage its used car database. FordDirect.com, which includes new Ford cars and trucks, will use AutoTrader.com to make a database to list Ford's used models on the Internet, the companies said in a statement. In exchange, AutoTrader.com will add FordDirect.com vehicles to its 1.5 million listings on its site.
7/8/2001	Driving Vintage Models Can Cure Nostalgia	EVERYONE knows you can't turn back the clock, but that doesn't keep automakers from trying. With Ford's reborn Thunderbird due to arrive in dealerships later this summer, and with BMW's new Mini and Nissan's reincarnated Z car set to appear next year, it is easy to get all mushy about the past. There is, however, nothing like knocking off a few hundred miles in vintage transportation to gain some perspective on nostalgia.
7/7/2001	S.U.V. Chic: The Rugged and the Reckless	To the Editor: I find it hypocritical that the Ford Motor Company is providing safety classes for those who drive S.U.V.'s while the industry continues to market them as if they can be driven with abandon (''Ford Wants to Send Drivers of Sport Utility Vehicles Back to School,'' news article, July 4).
7/5/2001	Miscellany	* The Advertising Club of Greater Boston was renamed the Boston Idea Group. * John McEnroe, the tennis commentator and player, is being featured in television commercials for the Lincoln line of automobiles sold by the Ford Motor Company, which are scheduled to begin running today. Mr. McEnroe is part of efforts to attract younger buyers to Lincoln. The spots are by the Lincoln agency, the Irvine, Calif., office of Young & Rubicam Advertising, owned by the WPP Group. * The Saturn Corporation, Troy, Mich., part of the General Motors Corporation, will begin introducing a compact sport utility vehicle, VUE, with a promotional campaign in August that will start before the traditional advertising campaign. The promotions include vehicle displays traveling around the country and a Saturn blimp at sporting events. VUE is due out in the fourth quarter.
7/4/2001	Auto Sales Increased in June, Despite Decreases at Ford and G.M.	Auto sales last month rose 0.3 percent from June last year, the first monthly increase over 2000's record pace. The increase surpassed the expectations of analysts, who continued to be surprised by the strength of auto sales despite the sluggish economy. Foreign automakers, however, are still reaping most of the rewards. Ford Motor and General Motors both reported lower overall sales compared with June of last year, while the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler reported a 1 percent sales increase over June 2000 after months of declines.
7/4/2001	Ford Wants to Send Drivers of Sport Utility Vehicles Back to School	The Ford Motor Company wants to send Americans back to school to learn how to drive sport utility vehicles. After buying a stake in the largest chain of driving schools, Top Driver Inc., a few months ago, the automaker is developing a course to teach motorists how to drive sport utility vehicles differently from cars. Top Driver officials said the course would cover all aspects of driving, including rollover risk, the long stopping distances of sport utility vehicles and what to do if a tire blows out or suddenly loses its tread.
6/29/2001	Tires, Lawyers, Defects	To the Editor: Re ''S.U.V. Tire Defects Were Known in '96 but Not Reported'' (front page, June 24):
6/28/2001	Bridgestone/Firestone to Close Tire Plant at Center of Huge Recall	Still reeling from a huge tire recall and the end of its long relationship with the Ford Motor Company, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. said today that it planned to close one of its biggest tire factories. The factory, in Decatur, Ill., was singled out last August when Firestone recalled about 6.5 million tires after growing concerns about crashes of Ford Explorers equipped with its products. About 1,500 employees, mostly union workers and many with more than 20 years of experience, will probably lose their jobs.
6/24/2001	S.U.V. TIRE DEFECTS WERE KNOWN IN '96 BUT NOT REPORTED	A group of personal-injury lawyers and one of the nation's top traffic-safety consultants identified a pattern of failures of Firestone ATX tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles in 1996. But they did not disclose the pattern to government safety regulators for four years, out of concern that private lawsuits would be compromised. Sean Kane, the consultant, said he had identified 30 cases of tire failure in 1996 -- a few of them involving deaths -- after being retained by lawyers in Texas preparing lawsuits against Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.
6/24/2001	Counterpoint: Beautiful Exterior but a Lack of Soul	FOR an hour, my friend and I watched the middle-aged men in Dockers, button-downs and neckties stop and circle the gleaming black Thunderbird parked on a busy downtown street. Through the plate glass windows of Caf Zola, it was easy to see the look on their faces: sheer teenage lust, something these lawyers, and professors and technology executives would never display on the job (or shouldn't, anyway.)
6/24/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Ford Thunderbird; What's the Word on the T-Bird?	MY neighbor, who restores old cars as a hobby, telephoned. Could he photograph his 1966 Ford Thunderbird next to the 2002 model that I was test-driving? He wanted a shot of one of the last convertible Thunderbirds alongside the reborn model. His son, 17, who aspires to be an automotive engineer, took pictures as well. He cared little about the Thunderbird's illustrious heritage. He was born long after the trim original of 1955 and the classics that followed over the next decade or so. He remembered Thunderbirds only as bulky, boring, overstyled coupes, the last of which was produced in 1997. ''It's cool,'' he said of the new Thunderbird. ''It's about looking cool.''
6/22/2001	CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT PREDICTED AT FORD	Ford Motor's leaders are putting the finishing touches on some management changes in preparation for a board meeting next month, people close to the company said this week. W. Wayne Booker, 66, Ford's vice chairman, and Henry D. G. Wallace, 55, the chief financial officer, are expected to retire, something both men have been wanting to do for personal reasons, these people said. Martin Inglis, 50, the vice president for Ford brand operations in North America, is the top candidate to replace Mr. Wallace, while Nick Scheele, 57, the chairman of Ford of Europe, will replace Mr. Inglis. Ford declined to comment. Keith Bradsher (NYT)
6/21/2001	Some Conflicts Arise at Hearing On Ford Replacement-Tire Issue	A government agency briefed members of a House committee this afternoon on the safety of the tires that the Ford Motor Company is using to replace those made by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. after the committee chairman said the automaker might be using tires with even higher failure rates than the Firestones. On Tuesday, the chairman, Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, said that seven of the tire models that Ford was using to replace 13 million Firestone tires on its Explorer sport utility vehicles might have higher failure rates than those they were replacing. A spokesman for the Republican majority on the committee, Ken Johnson, raised that number to 11 today but said that the higher rates did not necessarily mean that the tires were unsafe.
6/20/2001	House Hearings on Ford and Firestone Clarify Little	The dispute between the Ford Motor Company and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety carried over into Congressional hearings today and became even more muddled when the committee chairman said he had information showing Ford might be replacing Firestone tires with brands that are even less reliable. The chairman, Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, said that seven of the tire models that Ford is using to replace 13 million Firestone tires might have higher failure rates than those they are replacing. He identified only two and added that he was not sure that his statistics were valid. Members of the committee then spent an extended portion of the seven-hour hearing arguing over whether members of the Democratic minority should have access to the data on the replacement tires.
6/17/2001	A Blame Game Hurts Both Ford and Firestone	EARLY on the morning of May 21, senior Ford Motor executives met with Bridgestone/Firestone officials at Firestone's headquarters in Nashville. Since the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires on Ford Explorers in August, after tire blowouts and vehicle rollovers, Ford had been analyzing the safety of the roughly 13 million Wilderness AT tires, made by Firestone, that were still in use on Explorers and Ford trucks. ''We wanted to get into a discussion at that time'' about tire safety, said Ken Zino, a Ford spokesman. Instead, John T. Lampe, the chief executive of Firestone, handed over a letter severing his company's 95-year-old link to Ford. The next day, Ford announced that it would replace those 13 million Firestone tires. ''We did not have confidence in the tire,'' Mr. Zino said.
6/15/2001	Ford Has Harsher Words For Latest Recalled Tires	Stepping up its feud with Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., the Ford Motor Company said today that some of the tires it began replacing last month failed even more often than those recalled last autumn. With just four days to go before top executives of Ford and Firestone are scheduled to testify before two House Energy and Commerce Committee panels, the two companies remain bitterly critical of each other.
6/13/2001	FORD CREATES UNIT TO INCREASE SALES OF BOAT ENGINES	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would set up a division to try to increase the company's sales of engines for boats. The company will open a marine division in September in Kennesaw, Ga., the company said. Ford plans to build a 42,000-square-foot center for the division's offices and operations. The Ford unit will work with Sterling Performance Engines on adapting engines for marine use. Ford sells automotive engines to other companies, which convert them for marine use and sell them to boat builders. The division plans to do the conversion work itself, said a spokeswoman, Karen McDowell.
6/10/2001	Business; The Corporate Alliance, as a Tightrope Act	BY announcing last month that it would no longer sell tires to the Ford Motor Company, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. completed the unraveling of a relationship that had spanned nearly a century. But in the arena of business alliances, the surprise was that Firestone's ''Dear John'' letter came so late in the relationship.
6/10/2001	Private Sector; Goodyear's Aggressive Diplomat	DIPLOMACY has always come naturally to Samir F. Gibara. Maybe it is because he has lived in eight countries, or maybe because he speaks six languages. Or maybe he was just born that way. But the fact is, in the five years in which he has led the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the Egyptian-born Mr. Gibara, 62, has successfully tiptoed through delicate negotiations with the heads of newborn Eastern European countries, acquired control of the European and North American assets of Sumitomo Rubber Industries of Japan (a deal he was careful to call a ''global alliance'') and even turned a head-to-head competition with Groupe Michelin of France into a project to jointly develop run-flat tires.
6/9/2001	House Committee Chairman Faults Inquiry on Firestone	Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has criticized federal regulators for investigating only the tires in a spate of tire-related rollovers of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. Mr. Tauzin asked regulators to study the performance of the Explorer as well as that of the Firestone tires. In a letter dated June 6 and released today, Mr. Tauzin requested that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration answer a series of questions about the stability and steering of the Explorer, and about whether the same Firestone tires produced problems on other types of automobiles. But the letter stopped short of asking the agency to expand its 16-month investigation to include the Explorer's design.
6/8/2001	VW Holders Approve Buyback	Defying protests from dissident investors, including several big institutions, Volkswagen A.G. received overwhelming approval from shareholders for its plan to buy back its stock and shore up its defenses against hostile takeovers. Volkswagen wants to buy back an additional 10 percent of its ordinary shares, on top of the 10 percent that it bought back last fall. The company has said it will use those shares in acquisitions or float them outside Germany.
6/2/2001	Bridgestone Split From Ford Is Seen as Most Un-Japanese	When the Bridgestone Corporation's Bridgestone/Firestone unit announced on May 21 that it would break off a longstanding supplier relationship with the Ford Motor Company, one widespread reaction was surprise that the company would do something so un-Japanese. The company's actions since then suggest that to some extent, that was the point -- and that it is getting across. ''Feisty'' is a word rarely associated with Japanese companies. Though they are often fierce competitors, they tend to be deeply reluctant to expose problems, conflicts and disagreements, and they have a reputation for nursing failed relationships and projects for years rather than suffer the embarrassment of a public argument or admission of error.
6/2/2001	Ford May Reshuffle Management in Wake of Tire Problems	Struggling to regain control of tire problems in Ford Explorers that have tarnished the image of the Ford Motor Company, the company plans to announce a reshuffling of senior management, possibly as soon as next week, people close to Ford Motor's leaders said today. The reshuffle will be done with several goals, these people said. Ford's board wants Jacques Nasser, the chief executive, to share some of his responsibilities with other executives, instead of having nearly two dozen executives report to him directly as he tries to play a role in many of their decisions. William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of the company, wants to have some of the executives now reporting to Mr. Nasser also report to him, so as to increase Mr. Ford's knowledge of what is going on in the company.
6/2/2001	Auto Sales Off A Mere 1.2% Last Month	The enduring strength of the auto market has surprised economists every month this year and did so again today, as auto sales fell only 1.2 percent from May of last year, while General Motors unexpectedly posted a small increase in sales. G.M.'s gain appeared to come mainly at the expense of Ford Motor, which suffered a sharp drop in sales, particularly for its Explorer and other sport utilities. George Pipas, Ford's manager of sales analysis, said that tire problems at Ford had not produced any clear effect on sales, and attributed the weakness partly to the generous rebates and other incentives being offered by Ford's rivals.
6/1/2001	Firestone Asks U.S. to Study Ford Explorer	Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. asked the Transportation Department today to open a safety investigation of the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle, contending that the Explorer's design makes it prone to rollover crashes when a tire fails. It is unheard-of in the auto industry for a parts supplier to seek a federal investigation of an automaker. But Firestone is now trying to salvage its brand name by persuading the public that the scores of deaths in crashes of Explorers equipped with Firestone tires were the fault of the vehicle. The Ford Motor Company has said the tires are responsible. It announced in mid-May that it would spend $3 billion to replace up to 13 million Firestone tires.
5/25/2001	Firestone's Revival Strategy: Be Contrite and Attack Ford	Bridgestone/Firestone hopes to win back public confidence by quietly acknowledging that it has made some faulty tires while also trying to shift much of the blame for scores of accidents to the Ford Motor Company. The risky corporate strategy -- which is evolving into a nasty battle between one of the world's largest automakers and one of the biggest tire manufacturers -- is taking shape here at the headquarters of Firestone, where top executives are trying to revive a distressed brand name.
5/25/2001	Volkswagen Tries to Foil Suitor	Executives of the German carmaker Volkswagen said this week that they were considering several strategies to stave off a potential hostile bid, including selling or partly spinning off its Audi luxury brand. Volkswagen is currently protected from a hostile takeover by an unusual provision that the European Union is considering overturning.
5/24/2001	Widespread Doubts Among Drivers on Firestone's Future	J. A. Tipps drove his Lincoln Continental to the Rose Tire shop today to check out a problem tire. He ended up changing all four of his tires, just to be safe -- four Michelin tires. ''As far as I'm concerned, Firestone's had it,'' said Mr. Tipps, an 82-year-old retired salesman who lives in this suburb northeast of Nashville. ''I have driven on Firestone tires, but no more.''
5/24/2001	Bridgestone Stock Ends Steep Fall	Shares of the Bridgestone Corporation steadied today as concerns eased about about the future of its American subsidiary, Bridgestone\Firestone. The stock closed unchanged, at 1,268 yen ($10.58), after falling 9.6 percent on Tuesday.
5/24/2001	Ford and Firestone Wrangle Over Rollovers and Tires	Corporate strategists advise companies facing litigation and public criticism to work together, but Bridgestone\ Firestone and Ford Motor have chosen stealth instead over the last week, a sign of the acrimony and mutual distrust that has destroyed their nearly century-old partnership. Instead of standing shoulder to shoulder as they face hundreds of lawsuits, further Congressional hearings and public criticism, Ford and Firestone have been playing elaborate games, refusing to speak to each other's executives and secretly telling regulators about safety problems with the other company's products.
5/23/2001	Ford Intends to Replace 13 Million Firestone Wilderness Tires	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it would replace 13 million Firestone Wilderness AT tires installed mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, including 1.5 million Wilderness tires that were mounted on the vehicles as replacements during the Firestone recall last autumn. Ford said it would immediately begin notifying the owners of vehicles fitted with 15-inch, 16-inch and 17-inch Wilderness AT tires at Ford assembly plants, and ask them to bring their vehicles to Ford dealerships or tire centers for free replacements. More than 80 percent of the tires are on Explorers or nearly identical Mercury Mountaineers, but there are also some Expedition sport utility vehicles and Ranger and F-150 pickup trucks with the tires, Ford said. The tires will be replaced with non-Firestone brands, mainly Goodyear and Michelin, in a program that is expected to take up to nine months to complete.
5/22/2001	Firestone to Stop Sales to Ford, Saying It Was Used as Scapegoat	Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., acting just ahead of an expected Ford effort to replace as many as 13 million more Firestone tires on its Explorer sport utility vehicles, said today that it would stop selling tires to Ford. Firestone accused Ford of questioning the safety of its tires to divert attention from problems with the Explorer, in which more than 100 people have died in tire-related crashes -- almost all rollovers.
5/22/2001	Text of Letter to Ford From Bridgestone	Following is the text of the letter from John T. Lampe, the chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/Firestone, that was sent yesterday to Jacques Nasser, the chief executive of Ford Motor: Dear Mr. Nasser: Today, I am informing you that Bridgestone/ Firestone Inc. is ending its tire supply relationship with the Ford Motor Company. While we will honor our existing contractual obligations to you, we will not enter into any new tire sales agreements in the Americas with Ford beginning today.
5/21/2001	MediaTalk; Lou Dobbs Makes Good On His Return to CNN	Lou Dobbs, the financial news anchor who left CNN two years ago but returned to a hero's welcome last Monday, had a pretty good first week back behind his old desk -- though it was not without its speed bumps. His program, ''Moneyline,'' registered significant ratings gains -- beginning the week by catching up with its main competitor on CNBC, ''Business Center,'' before dropping to a lower, yet still improved level.
5/20/2001	Firestone Adds Data In Feud With Ford	Stepping up its feud with the Ford Motor Company as the automaker appears likely to seek a second broad recall of Firestone tires, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. has distributed new data to personal-injury lawyers suggesting that the problem lies partly with the design of the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle. Bridgestone/Firestone looked at its claims for property damage or injury for the 6.5 million tires that it recalled on Aug. 9. Most of the tires were mounted on Ford Explorers as factory-installed equipment, but some were on Rangers. Before they were recalled, the tires were 7 to 10 times more likely to produce claims per million Explorers than per million Rangers.
5/20/2001	A Boost for Booster Seats	THE nightmare that hovers over everyone who loves a child was nearly played out for me almost 40 years ago, when I had the morning route on a five-child car pool from Upper Manhattan into the Bronx. Our younger son, Ben, was not old enough for school, but I could not leave him alone. Cars then had no seat belts, so he rode home in the back seat unsecured. When I jammed on the brakes because a car ahead of us stopped short, the passenger seat flopped forward and Ben hurtled over it into the space under the dashboard. He howled but was not injured. We got home somehow, but to this day I annoy my family by extending my right palm onto any passenger's abdomen when I brake suddenly. ''We have belts on!'' they cry. ''This is not 1962!'' Indeed. But seat belts, air bags or not, traffic crashes remain the leading cause of death and injury to children: 2,474 children under the age of 15 died in auto accidents in 1999, the most recent figures available at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show.
5/19/2001	Bridgestone Disputes Need For Bigger Firestone Recall	Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. lashed out today at the Ford Motor Company for having concluded that there are problems with Firestone tires that were not covered by the recall last August. ''Let me state categorically: tires supplied to Ford Motor Company, and other customers, are safe, and the tires are not defective,'' John T. Lampe, Bridgestone/Firestone's chairman and chief executive, said in a letter to Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive and president. ''As we have said since last August, the role of the vehicle must be taken into account.''
5/19/2001	Detroit Splits the Difference; Car-Based S.U.V.'s Are Unlikely to Stem Slide In Fuel Economy	Auto sales are shrinking and discounts have spread even to the largest sport utility vehicles. But sales have nearly tripled this year for one category of vehicles that is being marketed with virtually no discounts at all: sport utility vehicles based on car designs. New models like the Toyota Highlander, which shares the mechanical underpinnings of a Toyota Camry, and the Ford Escape, which is based on a Ford Contour sedan, represent a powerful new development in the American auto market.
5/18/2001	Ford Is Said To Consider Seeking Recalls Of More Tires	The Ford Motor Company has concluded that there are safety problems with a number of Firestone tire models beyond those recalled last year and is leaning toward demanding that Firestone recall more tires, three people close to Ford's deliberations said today. The safety issues are not as serious as those that prompted last year's voluntary recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires supplied with Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, these people said. Failures of the tires already recalled have been associated with the deaths of more than 100 people, almost all of them in Explorers that rolled over after the treads suddenly peeled off tires during prolonged high-speed driving in hot weather.
5/18/2001	As Retro as a New Ford Can Be	FORD is hard at work on a vehicle that stands nearly 7.5 feet high, has a folding top and can reach 50 miles an hour. It is not an S.U.V. Rather, it is the Car of the Century -- the last century. Ford is building six all-new Model T's as it prepares to celebrate its centennial in 2003.
5/13/2001	Private Sector; The Salesman Knows His Audience	Jacques Nasser, chief executive and president of the Ford Motor Company, who was honored at the Columbia Business School dinner, is in a good mood these days. Not only is Ford poised to overtake General Motors as the largest automobile company, but Ford is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary. For Mr. Nasser, that's pretty sweet, especially since just a year earlier, Ford and other old-economy stocks were ''being written off as dinosaurs,'' he said. But with the end of the technology stock bubble, according to Mr. Nasser, ''I have to say, many of our old-fashioned virtues are now being recognized.''
5/6/2001	Ford's New Big Rig Is Larger Than Life	HAVE you been seduced by the romance of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and yearn for your own piece of long-haul glory? Ford is building a truck for you. The F-650 Super CrewZer is the largest truck available to noncommercial customers. Based on the Super Duty chassis, the Super CrewZer rides on a wheelbase 194 inches long -- that is, you could practically fit a Taurus between the axles -- and offers a bridge-bending cargo-and-trailer capacity of nearly 30,000 pounds. New Yorkers who want the Giants nearby might rethink their support for a new stadium: Why not just relocate the Meadowlands?
5/6/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Super Duty F-250 and Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD; Reaching Critical Mass in the Civilian Arms Race	AMERICA is the land of the very, very big. Big hair, big malls, big cities, big Las Vegas hotels that look like big cities, big movies starring big ships that sink in a big way. Big is practically a good unto itself, not to be confused with the relativistic notion of ''scale,'' to which some old-fashioned professors of design still cling. If the roads seem smaller, it is only because you are sharing them with a new breed of giants. Heavy-duty pickups -- loosely defined as trucks with gross vehicle weight, or G.V.W., of more than 8,500 pounds, including the vehicle and the maximum cargo load -- account for about a third of the two million full-size pickups bought annually in the United States.
5/4/2001	Ford Tries to Burnish Image By Looking to Cut Emissions	The Ford Motor Company reaffirmed its concerns about global warming today, but said that it did not support stiffer federal fuel-economy standards or the international Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions as ways to address the problem. In its second ''corporate citizenship report,'' Ford said that it had formed a committee of executives to examine ways to reduce the company's contribution to global warming.
5/3/2001	Ford's 70-Year Itch Could Be Relieved; As G.M. Stumbles, Its Perch at the Top Is Within Reach	The last time Ford Motor was the world's biggest automaker was 1930, when Henry Ford, the founder, was still in charge, the Model A had finally replaced the Model T and Margaret Mitchell was still writing ''Gone With the Wind.'' General Motors -- led by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., who organized a half-dozen separate car lines under one corporate umbrella and introduced the concept of the annual model change -- surpassed Ford the following year. It remained the nation's largest company, and at times, the world's largest, through most of the rest of the 20th century.
5/2/2001	Auto Sales Were Down Last Month	Auto sales fell in April, providing the first important indicator of the economy's condition early in the second quarter and a sign that weakening consumer confidence is beginning to affect spending on high-price products. The auto industry sold cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 16.6 million vehicles, down 10 percent from a year earlier. Sales in April were a little higher than what the auto industry considers to be the long-term demand for new automobiles but below the annual rate of 17.2 million cars and light trucks in the first quarter.
4/26/2001	$49 MILLION TO BE INVESTED IN CHINESE VENTURE	Ford Motor agreed to invest $49 million in a Chinese joint venture that will assemble passenger cars in that country, which is expected to eventually become one of the world's largest car markets. But the modest investment reflects the difficulty the company has faced in finding a suitable project and reflects the market's slower-than-expected growth. General Motors has invested more than $1 billion in two auto plants in China so far. Ford's partner, the Chongqing Changan Automobile Company, is China's No. 3 carmaker and is based in the central Chinese city of Chongqing. The venture is expected to begin production in 2003.

4/26/2001	Explorer Model Raises Doubts About Safety	Walk along the assembly line at the Ford Motor factory in Louisville, Ky., and a striking pattern quickly becomes apparent: half of the underbodies are low and wide and have modern carlike rear suspensions, while the other half are high and narrow and have old-fashioned trucklike rear suspensions. The low, wide underbodies are for the redesigned four-door 2002 Ford Explorer. The high, narrower underbodies are for the two-door 2001 Ford Explorer Sport, which has retained basically the same mechanical underpinnings since 1991, although the design of the vehicle's exterior sheet metal was tweaked last year.
4/21/2001	Incentives Offer On Ford Explorer	The completely redesigned 2002 Ford Explorer has been on sale only a month, and Ford Motor is already offering discounted lease rates and rebates for customers who own an earlier Explorer model. Industry analysts say that offering discounts to current owners of the same make of vehicle is part of Ford's standard approach to introducing new models.
4/19/2001	Bike Power: Tired Legs Get a Leg Up	ANDREW DELANO describes his bicycle commute over the Brook lyn Bridge as the highlight of his day. ''Riding up that incline, there's really nothing like it,'' he said. But in the last few years, as Mr. Delano, an artist, reached his early 40's, he found that the nine-mile round trip between his East Village apartment and his Brooklyn studio was becoming more physically demanding, especially when he had to carry tools and equipment.
4/6/2001	JURY RULES IN FORD'S FAVOR IN SUIT OVER SPORT UTILITY	A Texas jury has exonerated Ford Motor of liability in a $50 million wrongful death claim involving an Explorer sport utility vehicle. It was the first Explorer defective-design case to go to trial, a Ford spokeswoman, Kathleen Vokes, said. The verdict was issued late Wednesday. Ford faces about 200 product-liability cases, many involving Explorer rollovers that occurred after Firestone tires failed. In the Texas case, Nathan Maier, a 47-year-old engineer who drove a 1995 Ford Explorer, died in a 1997 multiple-car accident outside Dallas. His family sued Ford in state court, contending that Ford knew it was selling a sport utility vehicle with a defective design and ignored its own engineers' recommendations to reduce rollover risks.
4/6/2001	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Design; What Should Luxury Look Like?	THEIR big sedans still make the social scene, those Cadillac DeVilles and Lincoln Town Cars idling outside elegant parties. Their very different sport utilities, the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator, are beloved by rappers and young screen idols. But America's leading luxury carmakers are eager to develop new, more consistent design themes as they try to expand their global appeal. The different directions they are taking will be evident at the New York International Auto Show, which opens on April 14 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The MK 9 concept car offers a taste of Lincoln's new look. Its creation was directed by Gerry McGovern, the 44-year-old British designer of the Land Rover Freelander and MG F sports car, who took over Lincoln's design studio in 1999. As a ''halo car'' -- aimed at catching the eye of consumers, who may then buy a plainer model -- the MK 9 hovers like a vision of the future over the conservative Town Car, the imposing Navigator and the subtle, European-influenced LS sedans.
4/5/2001	FORD WILL BUILD DIESEL SPORT UTILITIES FOR EUROPE	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would build diesel-powered 2002 Explorer sport utility vehicles for export to Europe to cater to customer preferences in the region. The automaker plans to produce 10,000 to 15,000 of the vehicles annually at its St. Louis assembly plant. Ford said it had begun making prototypes of the diesel vehicles, which will be shipped to Europe later this year. The Detroit Diesel unit of DaimlerChrysler will supply the engines. The Explorer is the best-selling sport utility vehicle in the United States. Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., sells an estimated 5,000 gas-powered Explorers a year in Europe, said a spokesman, Jon Harmon.
4/5/2001	2 Approaches To Aftermath Of Tire Recall	Still struggling to recover from the recall last August of Firestone tires installed mainly on Ford Explorers, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. will begin on Friday the largest advertising campaign in the company's history in an effort to reassure customers, Firestone officials said today. The company also plans to announce on Thursday several moves to improve tire safety.
4/4/2001	Rebates Help Vehicle Sales Remain Strong	Automakers continued to sell a surprising number of cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in March, despite a slowing economy and falling stock markets. But these sales did not come cheap, as manufacturers extended rebates and other discounts to models that seldom carried them last year. The auto industry sold family vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 17.1 million vehicles, according to sales figures released by all the major automakers today. That was well above the rate of 16 million vehicles that the industry regards as strong, although the number of vehicles sold was still 4 percent lower than the extraordinary number a year earlier.
4/3/2001	Ford Introduces Its Delayed Internet Shopping Site in 9 States	In another sign that the Internet may not produce quick changes in the way cars are sold, the Ford Motor Company announced today that its much-delayed Internet service had begun doing business, but in only nine states. In seven of those states, moreover, the Web site will quote only the manufacturer's suggested retail price; customers will have to send an e-mail message to a dealer to ask for a lower price. Only in New Jersey and Delaware is the new service, known as FordDirect.com, quoting prices below the suggested retail price, and customers must still visit dealers to actually buy a new car or truck.
4/2/2001	Ads for Ford's New Explorer Sidestep Safety Issue	When it comes to image polishing, the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle would seem to need some real elbow grease, given all the negative publicity about Firestone tire problems and rollover deaths involving the Explorer. But when Ford Motor rolls out its extensive new advertising campaign this month for the completely redesigned 2002 Explorer, the company will be dealing with the safety issue in a nonintuitive way -- by largely ignoring it. Instead, Ford plans to join the crowd of other sport utility vehicle manufacturers in presenting the Explorer as a way for customers to enrich their lives with experiences like rock climbing, fishing, even golf.
3/30/2001	Jaguar Announces New Global Agency	Jaguar Cars, part of the Ford Motor Company, formally announced yesterday the selection of Young & Rubicam Advertising, part of the Young & Rubicam unit of the WPP Group, to handle its worldwide creative account. Billings for the account, to be led from the agency's Irvine, Calif., and London offices, were estimated at $125 million. The account had been handled for about a decade by the Global Communications Group, a joint venture of two other WPP agencies: Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York and J. Walter Thompson in London. The shift had been expected since January, when Jaguar named Y.& R. to handle what was described as an assignment to create a worldwide campaign to introduce the X-Type, a compact all-wheel-drive sedan.
3/24/2001	Judge Orders Trial in Case Against Ford Over Ignition Systems	A California judge yesterday ordered a trial to begin later this year to assess damages in a case filed against the Ford Motor Company on behalf of millions of car owners who say the company knowingly installed defective ignition systems. Last year the judge, Michael E. Ballachey, concluded in a class-action lawsuit that Ford had engaged in a huge cover-up, concealing from both regulators and consumers a design flaw, affecting 22 million cars produced between 1983 and 1995.
3/19/2001	Companies Turn to Grades, And Employees Go to Court	An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies. At issue is the ranking of managers, professionals and sometimes lower-level employees from best to worst, or grading them on a bell curve, and then using that ranking to help determine pay and sometimes whether to fire someone.
3/18/2001	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Ford Explorer; Once a Truck, Always a Truck	HIGH, wide and rugged, big sport utility vehicles seem invincible. But their vulnerability became all too obvious last month when my family and I left our retreat in the Sierra Nevada foothills to head up Interstate 80 for a day of skiing. Snow was falling as we climbed east toward Donner Pass, and the pavement was slushy, even icy. High speeds were hazardous. So were sharp turns.
3/12/2001	Ford Promotes Executive From E-Business	In a vote of confidence in Internet marketing by a giant of the old economy, the Ford Motor Company has increased considerably the responsibilities of the president of its electronic commerce operations. On Friday, Brian P. Kelley, the 40-year-old president of Ford's ConsumerConnect unit, which handles e-business, was put in charge of Ford's brand management, dealer relations, auto parts sales, market research, advertising purchases, and some sales and marketing activities, while retaining oversight of electronic commerce.
3/11/2001	AIR-BAG CASE	Eric Thomas, a dentist from Cape May County, says an air bag was responsible for his wife's death in a 1997 car accident and has sued the Ford Motor Company. Ford says Dr. Thomas strangled her. The case took a new turn when court documents filed last week showed that he confessed in recent depositions to having had an affair at the time his wife died. He had denied the affair in earlier depositions. Dr. Thomas is now married to the woman with whom he was having the affair. Abhi Raghunathan
3/6/2001	THE MARKETS: The Markets; No Earnings, Debatable Prospects: A New I.P.O. With a 90's Feel	Get ready for the return of the Internet concept stock. On Thursday, Loudcloud Inc. is expected to offer shares to the public in what seems like a throwback to the dot-com glory days. The Silicon Valley company has a constellation of star power rallying behind its chairman, Marc Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape Communications.
3/3/2001	G.M. and Ford Losing Out in the European Market	For months now, attention in the automobile industry has been riveted on the implosion of DaimlerChrysler, which announced a three-year plan on Monday to reverse the huge losses at Chrysler in the United States. But as car executives gathered here this week for Geneva's international car show, there was little room for gloating at either General Motors or Ford Motor. Here in Europe, both G.M. and Ford are losing money and market share, and both are struggling to remake their dowdy images.
3/2/2001	Vehicle Sales Held Strong Last Month	American consumers continued to flock to car dealerships in February despite the economic slowdown, producing another unexpectedly strong month for auto sales. Sales fell 6 percent last month from February 2000, but the year-earlier month had been one of the best in the industry's history because of lavish incentives. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was 17.5 million vehicles, in an industry that considers anything above 16 million vehicles to be an excellent month.
2/20/2001	Detroit's Answer to 'Hybrid' Cars; Cheaper Than Japan Models, But Far Less Fuel Efficient	Japanese automakers have led the way in selling ''hybrid'' cars, which have improved fuel economy and reduced tailpipe emissions by running on either gasoline or electricity. But the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, on the American market for a year, are costly to produce and sold in limited numbers at a loss. So Detroit is trying a middle ground. American automakers will offer some ''full hybrids,'' capable of running on battery power alone at low speeds, but are putting their main focus on electrically assisted gasoline engines. Such engines, which cost little more than conventional engines but use a less ambitious technology than some environmentalists want, will become an option or standard equipment on dozens of models in coming years.
2/19/2001	Workers Seize Big Daewoo Car Plant in South Korean Port	Hundreds of workers at the Daewoo Motor Company seized the company's huge manufacturing plant here today, pledging to hold it until the financially troubled company gives up plans to lay off more than a third of its work force and reinstates those already dismissed. ''We will keep on striking until the government abolishes the layoff plan,'' Kim Il Sop, the president of the union representing the workers, said in an interview at union headquarters inside the factory. ''We have gathered the workers in small groups throughout the plant to fight the police.''
2/14/2001	High Fatality Rate Found in Cars That Crash With Explorers	A new federal study of how vehicles interact in crashes has found that Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles seem to be especially deadly to the occupants of cars they hit, even compared with other midsize sport utility vehicles. The statistical study calculated that four-door Explorers with four-wheel drive killed 10 car drivers for every 1,000 crashes between Explorers and cars that were reported to police from 1991 through 1997. By contrast, the study said, several other midsize sport utility vehicles, like the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Toyota 4Runner and Chevrolet Blazer, killed five to seven car drivers for every 1,000 crashes with cars.
2/11/2001	Every Inch Counts in a Toyota-Ford Space Race	JUST when you'd begun to forget about undervotes and butterfly ballots, two automakers are embroiled in their own counting dispute -- over technical specs, not dangling chads. Once again, the winner may depend on how one interprets the rules. Ford has accused Toyota of cheating by making claims that the Sequoia sport utility is substantially more spacious, and has more ground clearance for off-road use, than the like-sized Ford Expedition. Toyota says its measurements are legitimate. But while the spat even involves benches -- as in bench seats -- there seems little chance that the Supreme Court will choose a victor.
2/8/2001	LAWYERS WANT DATA ON BRIDGESTONE TIRES MADE IN JAPAN	The Bridgestone Corporation produced Firestone ATX steel-belted radial tires in Japan with a design different from ATX tires that have been recalled in the United States, lawyers representing people injured in tire-related crashes said yesterday. The Japanese-made tires used an extra wire in each of the steel cords that made up the steel belts and used thicker rubber, said the lawyers, who contended that this produced a stronger tire. Jill Bratina, a spokeswoman for Bridgestone's American subsidiary, said the tires made in Japan met the same performance specifications as in the United States but had been manufactured differently because of the type of resources available in Japan. Ms. Bratina would not elaborate or provide statistics on tires by place of manufacture, something the lawyers have requested. Keith Bradsher
2/6/2001	A Ford Heir Struggles For Control	William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, has been frustrated in recent months at being left out of decisions at the company that bears his family's name, people close to Ford's leadership said. Mr. Ford last autumn even raised the idea of appointing a chief operating officer, which would have made him less dependent for information on Jacques Nasser, the company's chief executive and president, these people said. Mr. Nasser opposed the creation of the post, and the idea -- which the company has not talked about publicly -- has been shelved for now.
2/3/2001	Expert Says Car Weight Was Key in Tire Failures	Firestone tires have been failing on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles because of a combination of factors, especially the vehicle's weight, according to a report issued today by a professor retained by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. Sanjay Govindjee, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, said in his report that tire inflation pressure, hot weather and vehicle speed had all played a role in causing a fraction of 1 percent of Firestone tires to lose their treads during highway driving. But he said that the most important single factor in determining how quickly cracks spread through the tires was how much weight they were carrying.
1/28/2001	If Women Complain, Does Ford Listen?	UNTIL last summer, every time Justine Maldonado went to work at Ford's assembly plant in Wixom, Mich., there was one person she went out of her way to avoid: a supervisor at the quality control department, where she was an inspector. In 1998, according to a lawsuit that she brought in June against Ford, he began harassing her, exposing himself and demanding oral sex. Once, she says, he followed her as she drove home and, when she pulled into a parking lot, assaulted her and tried to pull off her clothes.
1/19/2001	Ford 4th-Quarter Earnings Fell 40% as Sales Slowed	The Ford Motor Company said today that its earnings dropped 40.4 percent in the fourth quarter as slower sales in a weakening American economy crippled profits in its North American operations. For the last five years, Ford executives have taken considerable pride in their robust earnings in the United States, the result of having bet heavily and early on the boom in sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. But the company's profits as a percent of sales plunged to 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 5.5 percent in the period a year earlier.
1/16/2001	Changes of agencies and accounts may affect the marketing of meat and motoring.	CHANGES are affecting marketers that advertise everything from talk to pork -- which may rhyme, depending upon your regional speech patterns -- on accounts with combined billings estimated at more than $500 million. Verizon Wireless in Bedminster, N.J., a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone named the New York office of the Bozell Group, part of True North Communications, as agency of record on its account, including its national brand advertising. Billings were estimated at $300 million.
1/14/2001	What Has Tab Turner Got Against Ford?	Winerip's discussion of auto-tire safety offered any number of villains, including politicians and the executives of Ford and Firestone. But for all the virtue of Tab Turner's cause, and his talent and expertise, he seems interested in Donna Bailey, a rollover victim, primarily as ''the perfect case.'' Thomas Weinland Mansfield Center, Conn.
1/14/2001	What Has Tab Turner Got Against Ford?	If the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has to be emasculated, I suppose we should be thankful that an advocate like Tab Turner is stepping in to create financial incentives for auto makers to design safer products (Michael Winerip, Dec. 17). But why must Turner devote only an elbow to driving his own S.U.V., while his hands and attention are devoted to drinking coffee and cell-phone conversations? For others' safety, if not his own, I wish he'd call a cab. Andrew Pearlman New Haven
1/14/2001	Measuring Driver Distraction	The information highway is rapidly merging with the asphalt variety. But how safe is it for drivers to use cell phones and other electronic gadgets? The Ford Motor Company is trying to find out. It has built a $10 million simulator -- involving projectors, digital sound synthesizers and a Ford Taurus attached to a hydraulic-motion platform -- to measure drivers' ability to handle traffic situations while using cell phones, navigation systems and other equipment. Cameras will monitor driver responses.
1/13/2001	'What Sales Slump?' Foreign Makers Ask	For the Nissan Motor Company, it seems like a poor time to be thinking about expanding in the United States. Its troubles at home in Japan are forcing it to close five factories there. Meanwhile, auto sales are slowing sharply here. Yet Nissan has just begun work on a new factory in Mississippi to make full-size pickup trucks for the American market.
1/12/2001	Chief of Bridgestone Says He Will Resign	The president and chief executive of the Bridgestone Corporation, the parent of the tire maker that has been linked to scores of fatal car accidents in the United States, said today that he would resign. The move was widely viewed in Japan as a way to assume responsibility for the problems in the United States and to renew the company's image, which had been tarnished by the recall of 6.5 million tires and the assertion that its tires had led to 148 deaths. The tires were made by Bridgestone's subsidiary, Bridgestone/Firestone.
1/11/2001	YAMAHA AND FORD IN VENTURE	The Yamaha Motor Corporation said it had agreed to set up a joint venture in the Unites States with the Ford Motor Company to develop and manufacture engines for recreational boats. Details like the size and site of the venture had not yet been settled, the company said. Yamaha and Ford said they had invited the Toyota Motor Corporation to join the venture, and that Toyota was considering doing so. Miki Tanikawa
1/10/2001	Lives Changed In a Split Second	Op-Ed article by Charles Wheelan, correspondent for The Economist, says he, his wife and their two daughters survived a recent rollover of their Ford Explorer not because it was a sports utility vehicle, but because they were using their seat belts and car seat; says SUV's, with their high center of gravity, are inherently more likely to roll over than other vehicles (M)
1/9/2001	Ford and Firestone Settle Suit Over Explorer Crash	The Ford Motor Company and Bridgestone/Firestone have both agreed to settle a high-profile lawsuit involving a Texas woman who was left a quadriplegic after the Explorer she was riding in rolled over because the tread separated on one of its tires. And while the settlement was thought to be very costly for the two companies -- people close to the family said the dollar value totaled in the tens of millions rather than the millions -- it enables Ford and Firestone to avoid what could have been an extremely damaging public trial. The settlement may also be a signal that the two companies' strategy to settle these suits privately and quickly and put the safety debacle behind them is working out. The Explorer-tire problem has been linked to 148 deaths in the United States.
1/9/2001	Ford Plans to Give Explorers' Engines an Electric Assist	The Ford Motor Company will announce plans on Tuesday to install electrically assisted gasoline engines to sharply increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions in a large proportion of the Ford Explorers it sells in 2004, company executives said. The plans are the broadest yet in the auto industry to introduce electric technology -- specifically, starters that turn a vehicle's engine on and off automatically, eliminating idling -- into the mass market.
1/4/2001	Vehicle Sales Fell Sharply In December	Auto sales slowed precipitously last month, with domestic automakers reporting plunges of up to 18 percent from year-ago levels. Foreign automakers, though, escaped almost unscathed and gained market share. Ward's Automotive, an industry data service, calculated that overall sales fell 7.6 percent from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 15.4 million cars and light trucks.
1/3/2001	FORD WILL INCLUDE TIRES IN WARRANTY COVERAGE	The Ford Motor Company, whose sales were hurt by a recall of 6.5 million Bridgestone/Firestone tires in August, said yesterday that it would include tires in its warranty coverage on 2001 model cars and light trucks in North America. The move ends a century-old arrangement under which tire makers took responsibility for tire warranties. General Motors began covering tires under its warranties in 1996.
12/29/2000	Another 2000 Record: The Most Recalls Yet	CAR buyers want more: more safety technology, more horsepower, more cup holders. What they don't want are more recall notices. But consumers are getting plenty anyway -- a record 21 million vehicles were the subject of safety-related recalls this year. But that may actually be a positive development, since each recall indicates an attempt to fix some sort of safety defect.
12/22/2000	Sharp Production Cutbacks Are Announced by Ford	Joining its crosstown rivals in responding to a rapid deterioration in the auto market, the Ford Motor Company announced sharp production cutbacks today -- including the closing of 13 of its 18 North American factories during the third week of January -- and lowered its forecast of fourth-quarter earnings for the second time in three weeks. The General Motors Corporation said separately today that 6 of its 25 North American assembly plants would be closed in the first week of January. Together with recent cutbacks in output at DaimlerChrysler, the moves by Ford and G.M. were the clearest signs yet that the auto industry, still the mainstay of the economy in the Great Lakes states, has slowed precipitously after nearly seven years of very strong sales.
12/19/2000	Firestone Engineers Offer a List of Causes for Faulty Tires	Offering their explanation for one of the most puzzling auto safety mysteries in decades, Firestone engineers today blamed a unique combination of tire and vehicle design, tire manufacturing and customer abuse for tire failures linked to the deaths of more than 100 Americans, almost all in Ford Explorers. A four-month internal investigation by Firestone found that the tire failures had their roots in decisions as simple as whether to use rubber pellets or rubber sheets in certain manufacturing processes, and whether the grooves in the side of a tire's tread were vertical or slanted, the engineers said in an interview today.
12/18/2000	Making S.U.V.'s Safer	To the Editor: Re ''Ford Issues Recall Over Speed Controls'' (Business Day, Dec. 12):
12/17/2000	What's Tab Turner Got Against Ford?	'I'll be back later,'' Tab Turner told his secretary as he rushed out of his North Little Rock law office, a file full of damning documents under his arm, a cell phone in one hand, a cup of coffee in the other. Brenda Gwin smiled but did not bother to ask what exactly her boss meant by ''later.'' Later could be 3 o'clock that afternoon or later could be one day next week. Even during normal times, Tab Turner is an incredibly busy man, a product-liability lawyer who has grown rich by specializing in sport utility vehicle rollover cases, who files scores of lawsuits each year against auto manufacturers. But lately, with rollover fatalities repeatedly being linked to the Ford Explorer and its recalled Firestone tires, Turner has been rocketing around the nation faster than a car with a sudden acceleration problem. Rarely is he in the same city two days in a row. New S.U.V. cases keep rolling his way; at the moment, he has 20 crashed Explorers and 50 mangled Firestone tires stored in a Little Rock warehouse for safekeeping in case he needs to produce them for trials against Ford or Bridgestone-Firestone.
12/15/2000	Firestone and Ford Make Progress on Tire Inquiries	Firestone and Ford Motor have made considerable progress in their investigations into the tire-related crashes that have killed more than 100 Americans, mostly in Ford Explorers, but they remained divided on some basic issues as they presented their results to regulators this week, people close to the inquiries said. Ford's newest finding is that a Firestone factory in Decatur, Ill., followed procedures different from those at other factories in handling rubber and other incoming materials, and these procedures may have allowed the quality of the materials to degrade, a person involved in the inquiry said. The steel-belted radial tires made in Decatur have had a much higher failure rate than tires of the same brands made elsewhere, according to Firestone and Ford.
12/12/2000	General Motors to Announce Plans for Oldsmobile's Future	With sales at its Oldsmobile division crumbling despite major discounts, General Motors scheduled a satellite broadcast by its chairman to its dealers on Tuesday morning to announce G.M.'s plans for the division, prompting speculation that the automaker might reorganize or even gradually eliminate the division. G.M. said that its chairman, John F. Smith Jr., would address the dealers while its chief executive, Rick Wagoner, and its president of North American operations, Ronald L. Zarrella, would hold a news conference. G.M. officials declined to discuss the details of their plans.
12/7/2000	RISKY DECISION/A special report.; Study of Ford Explorer's Design Reveals a Series of Compromises	Stephen Ross knew how dangerous it would be to wait. His bosses at Ford would approve only one risky new project that year, 1986. If his new sport utility vehicle -- the one he thought the Ford Motor Company needed right away to stay competitive -- was to beat out a luxury sports car being promoted by more senior rival executives, he and his small team would have to come up with an inexpensive design.
12/3/2000	A Ford Executive Puts It in Park	After only three and a half years on the job, Bobbie Gaunt, 54, the highest-ranking woman at the Ford Motor Company, announced last week that she would quit at year-end as president and chief executive of its Canadian subsidiary and return to Michigan to spend more time with her family and work for nonprofit and small-business groups. Like Maureen Kempston Darkes, president of General Motors of Canada, Ms. Gaunt, a Pittsburgh native who began her career at Ford in 1972 as the company's first woman trainee in sales and marketing management, has a high profile among Canada's few top women executives. Acknowledging that, she has said, ''I am a president who happens to be a woman, not a woman who happens to be president.''
12/2/2000	TOYOTA MAY MARKET FORDS	The Ford Motor Company is in talks with the Toyota Motor Corporation to sell Ford vehicles through Toyota dealers in Japan, an executive of Ford's Japanese subsidiary said. Ford said such a move would not undermine the Mazda Motor Corporation, which Ford controls, because Mazda dealers alone cannot handle all the demand for Ford cars.
12/2/2000	Automakers Are Facing a Sales Slowdown	Through most of the 1990's, automakers avoided building new assembly plants, convinced that the good times would not last. They have finally committed themselves in the last two years to a string of new factories, only to find their timing is as poor as ever: sales have begun to slow, particularly for Detroit's manufacturers. The combined sales of Detroit-based automakers fell 3.5 percent last month, compared with November of last year. While sales are still at a level that would have been considered very strong until the last two years, they have now lagged last year's pace in six of the last seven months -- and much more production capacity is becoming available.
11/27/2000	Ford to Redistribute European Assignments	Ford Motor is planning this week to make major realignments among the agencies handling its European assignments and brands. According to executives who have been briefed on Ford's plans, the company is to award to offices of Young & Rubicam, part of the WPP Group, the assignment to handle the vehicles sold by Land Rover, which Ford acquired from BMW A. G. Land Rover had been handled by WCRS in London, part of Havas Advertising, which resigned after the acquisition.

11/26/2000	Ford Thinks Green for Historic River Rouge Plant	THE Ford Motor Company revolutionized the world of manufacturing in the early part of the 20th century at its 1,100 acre industrial complex along the River Rouge here. People came from all around the world to observe a place where iron ore went into one end and a finished automobile rolled out the other a few days later. Now the company, which is still controlled by the founding Ford family, is again trying the draw the attention of the world to the plant. It has begun a $2 billion project to build a new automobile plant on the brownfield site -- a site contaminated as a result of its earlier operations -- with a plan to actually improve the environment around it.
11/23/2000	2 Automakers Plan to Idle Some North American Plants	DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the Ford Motor Company said today that they would idle some North American plants next week as the automakers try to reduce the number of unsold cars and trucks. DaimlerChrysler plants in Detroit; Brampton, Ontario; and Toledo, Ohio, will be closed for the week starting Monday, affecting about 13,600 workers, the company said. Ford is idling its Avon Lake, Ohio, plant, for two weeks starting next week, affecting about 1,600 workers.
11/22/2000	Ford to Offer Social Services For Workers and Retirees	The Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers announced one of the most ambitious social efforts ever undertaken by an American corporation yesterday, a program that will provide child care, recreation programs for teenagers and book clubs for retirees. The program, which grows out of the contract the auto workers signed last year, calls on Ford and its auto- parts spinoff, the Visteon Corporation, to establish more than 30 centers nationwide that will meet a range of workers' needs. The centers will provide backup child care for times when a baby sitter is sick, day trips for retirees, after-school programs for teenagers and prep courses for college entrance exams.
11/21/2000	Auto Sales Have Slowed This Month	Auto sales, often a leading indicator of the economy's health, have slowed since the beginning of the month, prompting carmakers to increase their already deep discounts and to consider additional temporary closings of factories, industry officials said today. General Motors and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have already closed some factories for a week at a time and appear likely to announce further temporary closings soon, they said. Ford Motor has avoided closing factories so far, except because of parts shortages, but its officials have been warning that the entire industry is slowing. And even foreign automakers are seeing some weakness in sales and have been offering many discounts.
11/19/2000	Florida Sun Puts Ford in the Shade	For a corporate leader who has endured the glare of bad publicity, it would seem that the last place Jacques A. Nasser, the Ford Motor Company president and chief executive, would want to appear is at a dinner honoring business journalists. After all, Mr. Nasser recently faced grilling over faulty Firestone tires on Ford Explorers. Yet Mr. Nasser came to Columbia University's annual Knight-Bagehot Fellowship dinner for the business press with a message: ''I want to thank the residents of Florida for taking us out of the news.'' He added that he had heard from 500 angry Florida residents ''who thought they were to get Ferraris when they went to get their Buicks.'' As for his Firestone fame, Mr. Nasser told a story about a child in a California shopping mall who turned to him and said, ''I know you.'' Mr. Nasser, pleased, took it as a sign of the growing popularity of business until the child asked, ''Aren't you the actor in the Ford commercials?''
11/19/2000	Process Is an Excuse To Avoid Conserving Fuel	To the Editor: The $20 million grant by Ford and Amoco to Princeton University (Briefing, Oct. 22) to develop solutions for global warming is not as philanthropic as it sounds. This grant is limited to the process known as sequestering, or extracting carbon dioxide from the stack gases of electric utilities, purifying and compressing it and transferring it to the bottom of the ocean. This obviously would be a very complicated and expensive process. It is like a doctor telling an obese patient not to worry about overeating; he will remove the excess fat by liposuction. Reducing our use of fossil fuels is a more practical means of reducing our carbon dioxide emissions. We have technologies for getting energy by wind and solar power and for using energy much more efficiently. The return on such investments are not high enough to be attractive right now, but they are the best way to assure a more secure future for our grandchildren. JOHN BURTON Washington
11/18/2000	Another Round of Layoffs At U.S. Firestone Factories	Stuck with a huge inventory of Firestone tires and slow sales because of the current recall, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced its second round of job cuts in a month today, saying that nearly 1,100 factory workers would be laid off for at least five months. The layoffs were the latest sign that sales of Firestone tires have not recovered from the recall on Aug. 9 of 14.4 million Firestone ATX and Wilderness tires that were mounted mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. Firestone estimated that 6.5 million of these tires were still in use when the recall began. The company said today that it had replaced 80 percent of these tires and that it expected to eliminate waiting lists for replacement tires by the end of the month.
11/14/2000	Auto Workers Stage Walkout For Higher Wages in Brazil	Auto workers in the state of Sao Paulo walked off assembly lines today in an effort to persuade car manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors, to increase wages. The work stoppage, which also affects Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and Scania A.B., comes as carmakers are trying to increase output to meet rising demand in Brazil. Sao Paulo accounts for more than 60 percent of the country's car production.
11/12/2000	Babes in the Woods: Putting 5 'Cute Utes' to the Test	SMALL sport utility vehicles are grabbing an ever-bigger chunk of the car market, and the hottest ones are cars at heart. They are designed like cars, with one-piece unit bodies, instead of like trucks, with separate bodies bolted to rugged frames. And they meld some car characteristics -- comfortable cabins, relatively responsive handling, compliant rides, reasonable fuel economy -- with the traits that have had people lining up for S.U.V.'s: good outward visibility, a ''commanding'' driving position, flexible cargo space and the bad-weather security of all-wheel drive. At prices in the low $20,000 range, these perky S.U.V.'s -- ''cute utes,'' in industry parlance -- are bargains compared with luxurious crossover vehicles like the $36,000 Lexus RX 300 and the $50,000 BMW X5.
11/12/2000	No Recount: Escape Wins	PLAYING musical driver's seats attunes one to a vehicle's personality, strengths and quirks. Solid and substantial, the Santa Fe exceeded my expectations. The much-improved RAV4 is impressive in many ways. But the Escape was the standout, striking a fine balance between fun and utility and capably handling every road, trail or track maneuver. 1. FORD ESCAPE -- Its V-6 was peppy, its transmission was smooth, its handling was quick and sharp, its steering was precise and linear -- no wonder the Escape felt best on-road or off. On the test track, it was the least likely to come unglued.
11/12/2000	Power and Poise Put Ford on Top	THREE years ago, when I had a chance to directly compare small sport utilities, they were easy to rank: Subaru Forester first, Honda CR-V second and Toyota RAV4 third. There are more players now, and they are better -- but harder to choose among. 1. FORD ESCAPE -- With an independent rear suspension and rack-and-pinion steering, the Escape handled accurately and predictably, and it rode well. On loose, washboard surfaces, it refused to skitter or skate. Although a four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission are standard, we drove a fancier XLT with a V-6 and four-speed automatic, which upshifted smoothly, downshifted quickly and didn't hunt for gears on hills. The economy rating is only 18 m.p.g. in town, but the Escape can tow 3,500 pounds -- by far the most in this group.
11/7/2000	Ford to Include Payload Data In Vehicles	The Ford Motor Company will warn buyers of its sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks about limits on how much weight they can carry safely in their vehicles. But the company says that it has not linked overloading to crashes involving Ford Explorer sport utilities equipped with Firestone tires. The automaker has decided to start including payload information next year on the stickers inside the doorjambs of Ford sport utilities and pickups to ''address customer satisfaction,'' said Jon Harmon, a spokesman for Ford. Ford is drafting new text for future owners' manuals, too, he said.
11/7/2000	Critics Say New Highway Safety Law Is Seriously Flawed	President Clinton signed a bill last week that he says will remedy ''some of the key shortcomings in identifying the recent Firestone tire problem.'' Although the legislation is expected to increase highway safety, auto safety experts see severe limitations in it. The law was passed hurriedly by Congress on Wednesday after the belated discovery that more than 100 people had died in Ford Explorers that flipped over when Firestone tires failed. But it does not address one of the agency's biggest problems: that its contact with the people who fix cars -- and see the problems first -- is limited.
11/5/2000	A Boomerang Effect	Jacques Nasser, chief executive of Ford Motor, has problems that go beyond Firestone tires on the company's sport utility vehicles. His strong Australian accent has emerged as a problem in the company's television advertisements. A Ford official who insisted on anonymity said that many people had called the company to express surprise that an American corporate icon like Ford had a foreign-born chief executive. Some complained that the accent was incomprehensible, others that he sounded like Crocodile Dundee.
11/2/2000	U.S. Auto Sales Sag, Another Slowdown Sign	Not even aggressive discounting by automakers could lift sales of new cars and light trucks last month, and bloated inventories of unsold models have led to the closing for a week of 8 of the nation's 55 auto assembly plants. Auto sales are the first important economic indicator to come out at the beginning of each month, and today's results were another sign that growth in the American economy has been slowing somewhat recently. Although sales have leveled off at a high level by historical standards, they are increasingly being sustained by ever more generous rebates and low-rate loans, rather than by strong consumer demand.
10/26/2000	Proceedings Are Consolidated In Federal Tire Recall Cases	A panel of federal judges decided today to consolidate in Indianapolis the pretrial proceedings in all but one of the 64 federal lawsuits against Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and the Ford Motor Company involving the failure of Firestone tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. The panel's decision is a victory for Firestone and Ford, which had feared that their executives and lawyers would have to give depositions in states across the nation. Lawyers who have filed the personal injury and class-action lawsuits had sought separate pretrial proceedings on the chance that discrepancies in depositions in one case could be used against the companies in others. After the pretrial proceedings, cases are likely to be sent back to the original courts for trial.
10/25/2000	Ford Shows Off Devices for Improved Safety and Mileage	Seeking to restore its reputation for safety and respond to high gasoline prices, the Ford Motor Company announced today a half-dozen high-technology approaches to improving traffic safety and gas mileage. Among the devices demonstrated at a news conference were tiny cameras that will send images from all around a vehicle to the dashboard as well as bumper-mounted air bags for the protection of pedestrians. Ford also showed off a six-speed automatic transmission and computer-controlled engine cylinders that are designed to help the company meet its pledge, made last July, to improve the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005.
10/24/2000	The Race Begins to Build a Small Car for China	General Motors said today that it would begin producing a small car in China in December, the first of several such offerings planned by some of the world's largest automakers, each hoping to dominate this country's potentially huge market. Based on the Opel Corsa that G.M. makes in Brazil, the car will be sold under the Buick brand and will be called the Sail in English, a transliteration of its Chinese name, Sai Ou, which means roughly ''compete with Europe.'' General Motors' China operations expect to face competition from European as well as American and Japanese manufacturers after China joins the World Trade Organization and car import duties fall.
10/23/2000	PeoplePC Finds Niche in Corporate Sales	It has been two years since a handful of ambitious start-ups began offering personal computers at no additional charge to customers willing to pay for several years of Internet service and, in most cases, to view a constant stream of online advertising. Only a few still exist. It is not surprising that Nick Grouf, chairman and chief executive of PeoplePC, resists comparison to those early trials. His company, founded in San Francisco a year and a half ago, may indeed offer personal computers along with Internet service for a three-year commitment. But from there, he insists, the similarities stop.
10/19/2000	Ford Says 3rd-Quarter Results Fell Because of Tire Troubles	This autumn's recall of Firestone light truck tires led to the Ford Motor Company's first quarterly drop in operating income in four years and has prompted Bridgestone/Firestone to undertake a broad reorganization, with Japanese executives taking control of key operations, the companies announced today. Ford's third-quarter profit from continuing operations dropped 16 percent, to $994 million, compared with $1.19 billion in the 1999 period.
10/19/2000	Death Inquiry Resumes After New Accusations in Auto Lawsuit	Prosecutors have reopened the case of a New Jersey woman whose 1997 death behind the wheel of a Ford Explorer was ruled accidental. The decision to reopen the case came after lawyers for the Ford Motor Company argued in a civil suit that she was strangled and that her husband was having an affair at the time. David Blaker, the acting Cape May County prosecutor, said he sent a letter yesterday to lawyers for Ford requesting records they had obtained listing 140 telephone calls from a home in Austin, Tex., to three phones belonging to the husband, Dr. Eric Thomas, around the time of his wife's death.
10/17/2000	Reminders Issued on Firestone Tire Replacements	Concerned that consumers are not getting the word that Bridgestone/ Firestone would replace some 700,000 suspect tires outside of the 6.5 million it has recalled, several states issued public reminders of the offer today. Some of the states, including Michigan and New York, also said they had won a promise from the tire maker to stop requiring that consumers who accept the offer give up their right to sue.
10/15/2000	Kids, Don't Try This With the Taurus at Home	AGATHA CHRISTIE he is not, but Ron Hazelton unravels the mysteries hidden deep inside your car in ''The Body Shop,'' a two-hour program that kicks off the History Channel's ''Modern Marvels: Men at Work Week,'' at 9 p.m. Eastern time Monday. If you can't tell your camshaft from your crankshaft and have ever wondered what horsepower really means, Mr. Hazelton, the handyman expert from ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' offers explanations as he and two certified mechanics methodically take apart a new Ford Taurus in front of the cameras.
10/13/2000	FORD SAYS IT WILL INCREASE FOURTH-QUARTER DIVIDEND 5%	The Ford Motor Company, the world's second-largest automaker, said yesterday that it would increase the dividend on common and Class B shares 5 percent, to 30 cents, in the fourth quarter. Ford also declared a dividend of 51.5625 cents a share on depository shares representing Series B cumulative preferred stock. The dividend declaration comes about a month after the automaker said it would buy back as much as $5 billion of common and Class B stock, increasing the amount of cash it plans to distribute to shareholders by $700 million, to $10.7 billion. All of Ford's Class B stock is held by members of the Ford family.
10/12/2000	Bill on Auto-Defect Reporting Passes Congress	Both houses of Congress overwhelmingly approved a bill today that would stiffen civil and criminal penalties for failing to report defects in cars and tires. The move is an unusually swift reaction to the failure of industry and regulators to recognize a problem with Bridgestone/Firestone tires on Ford Explorers until more than 100 people had been killed.
10/12/2000	Judge Orders Ford to Make Huge Recall	A California judge ordered the Ford Motor Company yesterday to recall and repair nearly two million cars and trucks after concluding that the automaker knowingly installed defective ignition systems in as many as 22 million vehicles nationwide and concealed the defects from consumers and regulators. The order, which Judge Michael E. Ballachey of Superior Court first indicated he would issue two months ago, was the first recall imposed on a carmaker by a judge in United States history. The case affects vehicles that were made between 1983 and 1995 and registered in California. If Ford is unsuccessful in persuading an appeals court to stay the order, the company will have to begin the recall as soon as a special referee, appointed yesterday by Judge Ballachey, decides what steps Ford must take to fix the ignition system.
10/11/2000	South Korea Points Fingers On Two Recent Failed Deals	The South Korean government began trying to assign blame today for the recent failures of two large business deals that have raised questions about the country's commitment to economic reform. Last month, the Ford Motor Company abandoned a $6.9 billion bid to buy Daewoo Motors, and a week ago, a group of investors led by Nabors Capital, a Houston-based firm, walked away from a proposed $480 million purchase of the Hanbo Steel Company. Both Korean companies are insolvent.
10/11/2000	House Passes Bill on Tire and Car Defects	The chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., Masatoshi Ono, resigned from those jobs today, and was promptly succeeded by John Lampe, the executive vice president of the American subsidiary of the Japanese company. The House of Representatives, meanwhile, prepared to take up a bill that would require auto companies that replace motor vehicle parts in a foreign country for safety reasons to notify American regulators and would require tire manufacturers to give regulators data on warranty claims. Ford replaced Firestone tires for owners of its Explorer sport utility vehicles in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, but did not tell American regulators. The bill would also raise penalties for failing to report defects. But the fate of a Senate bill on the same subject is uncertain.
10/11/2000	When One Model Lifts a Line	THE first Thunderbird was inspired by a visit to the 1951 Paris auto show by Lewis Crusoe, a Ford Motor Company executive, and the designer George Walker. Time magazine once called Mr. Walker ''the Cellini of chrome.'' At Ford, he created a clean and classic European sports car, a low-slung two-seater that combined a Ferrari-style grille with tail fins and rocket-thruster taillights. The Thunderbird could hardly have looked more different from the bulbous, bourgeois postwar sedans that people associated with Ford.
10/6/2000	Panel Approves Bill On Auto-Safety Issue	A bill that would give government auto-safety regulators more power to get information about defective products was approved 42 to 0 by a Congressional committee. The full House will vote on the bill as early as next week. The legislation would also allow fines as high as $100,000 and as much as 15 years in prison for auto company executives who know about defective vehicles or parts that cause injuries and fail to remedy the problems. Whistleblowers who help uncover data about auto defects would be shielded from prosecution under the bill, which would also extend government jurisdiction over car recalls to 10 years from 8, and over tire defect cases to five years from three.
10/4/2000	G.M.'s Sales Are Off, but Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Are Up	General Motors' United States auto sales fell last month as overseas rivals had gains and DaimlerChrysler offered deep discounts to move an aging minivan line. Ford Motor's sales rose on increases for the Explorer sport utility vehicle and other light trucks.
10/3/2000	A New Bridgestone/Firestone Tire Inquiry	Bridgestone/ Firestone Inc., a unit of the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, said tonight that it had made 27.5 million Firestone Steeltex tires, the brand that federal regulators began investigating last Friday after receiving 169 complaints of tire failure. The tires were made from 1991 to 2000 in Aiken, S.C.; Decatur, Ill.; Joliette, Quebec; Lavergne, Tenn.; and Wilson, N.C. General Motors said today that it had put the tires on some of its 1994 to 2001 Chevrolet and GMC full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and some of its 1996 to 2001 Chevrolet and GMC full-size and one-ton passenger and cargo vans. Ford Motor had said on Friday that at least since last year, it had been putting the tires on all of its Excursion full-size sport utility vehicles and 40 percent of its Super Duty pickup trucks and Econoline vans.
10/3/2000	Safety Agency Will Rate Vehicles for Rollover Tendencies	Government regulators have tested more than 100 automobile models for their tendency to roll over and found that sport utility vehicles like the Ford Explorer tend to be the least stable, particularly when fully loaded, while cars are the most stable. After 27 years of controversy over the rollover issue, members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are scheduled to meet as soon as Tuesday to approve a transportation budget that would let the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration begin rating vehicles' rollover tendencies, by assigning them one to five stars.
10/3/2000	Ford Motor Cutting Prices in Britain	Ford Motor, Britain's best-selling carmaker, has cut British list prices for cars and trucks and canceled cash-back offers, saying it wants to make vehicle prices easier for buyers to understand. The company said today that it had cut prices by amounts ranging from 5 to 13 percent, depending on the model. At the same time, it scrapped rebates of $:800 to $:1,300 ($1,181 to $1,919.)
10/2/2000	2 Firestone Studies in 1999 Pointed to Tire Problems	Firestone officials in Venezuela conducted at least two studies in 1999 that reviewed patterns of tire problems there while assuring Ford that tire failures in the country were isolated cases resulting from customer abuse and poor maintenance, internal Firestone documents show. The two studies are of interest because they describe dozens of cases in which steel-belted radial tires had treads and belts that were coming apart -- the same problem that led to the recall of Firestone ATX and Wilderness AT 15-inch tires in the United States on Aug. 9. But neither study compares the number of cases with the number of tires manufactured, making it difficult to assess the scope of the problem.
9/30/2000	A 2nd Front In the Inquiry Into Firestone	Federal regulators said today that they had opened a second investigation into Firestone tires, this time involving Steeltex tires used on the largest sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, said that it had received 169 complaints of problems with the tires, involving 8 crashes, 12 injuries and 2 deaths. The complaints covered many tires on Suburban sport utility vehicles and large vans made by General Motors as well as Excursion sport utility vehicles and F250 and F350 pickup trucks made by Ford.
9/29/2000	PARTNERSHIP ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS	In a deal to help speed the development of in-car electronic services, the Ford Motor Company and Peugeot Citroen of France announced that they would form an alliance to cooperate in automotive design and the development of wireless services like cell phone and Internet access and entertainment channels. The companies expect to formally seal the deal by the end of the year. In August, Ford formed a joint venture with Qualcomm Inc., called Wingcast, to equip its cars for wireless services. The deal is the latest example of a spreading web of cooperation agreements in the car industry. Ford and Citroen recently announced an agreement to cooperate in the development of diesel engines. John Tagliabue (NYT)
9/29/2000	Firestone Uneasy Over Threatened Changes	Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., which is struggling to cope with the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, can chalk up one more problem: growing uncertainty about who will be running the company in the days ahead. Yoichiro Kaizaki, the president of Firestone's parent, the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, created the uncertainty two weeks ago by declaring that a management reshuffle was likely at its American subsidiary, which is based in Nashville. But there has been no announcement.
9/29/2000	FORD SAYS 78% OF DEALERS ARE BACKING ONLINE VENTURE	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that 78 percent of its eligible member dealers had agreed to participate in FordDirect.com, which will sell cars and trucks on the Internet at the prices dealers pay. The Ford dealers council said 3,194 of the 4,080 eligible dealers in the United States, who account for 90 percent of Ford sales, had committed themselves to participating in FordDirect.com. The first online site is expected to be running in California next month. Automakers are trying to compete with online car-buying Web sites like Autobytel.com, Autoweb.com, CarsDirect.com and Greenlight.com, while trying not to threaten their traditional dealers.
9/28/2000	Judge Tells Firestone to Release Technical Data on Tires	A federal district court judge here ruled today that the public should have access to extensive information on tire technology that Firestone was compelled to turn over during a lawsuit over a fatal accident. The company said that releasing the documents would amount to giving up trade secrets. Judicial secrecy has emerged as a major issue in Washington as Congress tries to draft new laws improving the ability of Government regulators to monitor safety trends. Officials at the Department of Transportation say the sealing of documents in settled lawsuits is one reason they did not spot the pattern of scores of rollover deaths in Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires that failed.
9/27/2000	Ford Memo in 1990 Restricted Tire Suppliers' Rollover Tests	The Ford Motor Company told its tire suppliers a decade ago not to conduct without Ford's approval a driving test of the rollover tendencies of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks, an internal Ford document shows. The document is of interest because most of the 101 deaths blamed on Firestone tires in complaints to regulators have occurred in Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles that flipped over when a tire failed.
9/27/2000	Japanese Learning the Value of Corporate Public Relations	The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry thought it might be a good idea to prepare a handbook for member companies interested in learning how to cope more effectively with the media during a crisis. Its idea was so good the chamber badly underestimated the demand. The 1,000 copies it had printed in mid-July sold out in a day. To catch up, it printed an additional 42,000.
9/25/2000	Decatur Journal; City Winces in the Glare of the Spotlight on Tires	For residents here, no news would definitely be good news. Six years ago, they had their first encounter with the national news media when workers at the city's three biggest employers went on strike. A year later, the Archer Daniels Midland Company got caught up in a global price-fixing scandal.
9/23/2000	Ford Raises Recommended Tire Pressure	The Ford Motor Company recommended tonight that owners of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles inflate their tires to 30 pounds per square inch, instead of the 26 pounds that the automaker has recommended for the last 10 years. Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., the manufacturer of the Firestone light truck tires blamed for 101 deaths, mostly in Explorers, publicly urged Ford on Thursday to raise the recommended pressure. Ford agreed to the change tonight, but pointed out that Goodyear tires on Explorers had performed with virtually no problems at a pressure of 26 pounds. Ford also noted that even Firestone executives had agreed until the last few weeks that 26 pounds was an acceptable pressure.
9/23/2000	South Korea to Spend $44 Billion More to Support Banks	South Korea will have to spend another 50 trillion won, or about $44 billion, to prop up domestic banks, which were hit hard by the collapse of efforts last week to sell off the nearly bankrupt Daewoo Motor Company, the nation's finance minister, Jin Nyum, said today. While officials had anticipated that the $6.9 billion sale of Daewoo Motor to the Ford Motor Company would reduce bank exposure to the ailing carmaker, Ford unexpectedly walked away from its bid last week, creating a sense of urgency for the South Korean government to accelerate its restructuring efforts.
9/22/2000	In Testimony, Firestone Puts Onus on Ford	Firestone began an unusually explicit attack on the safety of Ford Explorers in testimony before a House subcommittee today as the two companies criticized each other's products and executives from both companies tried to explain internal documents that committee members found incriminating. Firestone said that operating a Ford Explorer with its tires inflated to the pressure recommended by the automaker, 26 pounds per square inch, provided a smaller ''margin of safety'' than existed for the Chevy Tahoe, Jeep Cherokee and other competing sport utility vehicles. Ford said that Firestone tires on 1996 Explorers were involved in fatal rollover accidents at a rate 15 times that of Goodyear tires on the same vehicle.
9/21/2000	Ford Tested Firestone Tires On Pickup, Not on Explorer	The Ford Motor Company acknowledged today that it had used a pickup truck, and not an Explorer sports utility vehicle, to test Bridgestone/Firestone tires at low air pressure, despite submitting an affidavit of a retired worker that implied that an Explorer was used. Congressional investigators quickly seized on the discrepancy, and Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, who plans to conduct a second hearing on Thursday on the tendency of the tires to fail and the vehicles to roll over, plans to ask whether the intent was to mislead Congress, according to a member of his staff.
9/20/2000	Sue, but Don't Prosecute	Former Atty Gen Dick Thornburgh Op-Ed article opposes bills spurred by Firestone-Ford tire debacle to make it Federal crime to make and sell defective products; drawing (M)
9/20/2000	HYUNDAI MIGHT BUY DAEWOO MOTOR	With few suitors remaining for the Daewoo Motor Company, its main creditor, the Korea Development Bank, will allow the Hyundai Motor Company, to bid for Daewoo on the condition that Hyundai bring in a foreign partner. Daewoo's future is in doubt because Ford Motor dropped its $6.9 billion bid last week. Samuel Len (NYT)
9/20/2000	More Deaths Are Attributed To Faulty Firestone Tires	Federal regulators announced this evening that since Aug. 31 they had received complaints of 15 more deaths attributed to Firestone tires on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, raising to 103 the number of deaths under review. Officials at the regulatory agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, cautioned that they had not determined how many of the complaints involved tires that had actually failed. The agency accepts complaints from consumers, lawyers, manufacturers and law enforcement agencies, and has not had time to investigate each complaint, officials said.
9/19/2000	As Ford Abandons Daewoo, South Korea Stocks Fall 8%	Unnerved by the Ford Motor Company's decision last week to abandon a takeover of the ailing Daewoo Motor Company, investors sold off South Korean securities today, pulling the stock market here to an 18-month low. Ford's decision on Friday to walk away from Daewoo -- without offering a lower price than the original $6.9 billion it bid -- was an unexpectedly heavy blow that both reduced chances of salvaging the company and sent something of a no-confidence message about the nation's economic recovery.
9/19/2000	Ford and Another Tire Maker Facing New S.U.V. Problems	Even as Firestone and Ford struggle to recall millions of defective tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, the Ford Motor Company and another tire maker, Continental A.G., are preparing to replace another brand of tire on 40,000 Lincoln Navigator full-size sport utility vehicles. Continental and the Lincoln division of Ford said in a joint statement this evening that they planned to present information on problems associated with the tires to regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at a meeting in Washington on Tuesday.
9/19/2000	Fatal Explorer Accidents Involving Bad Tires Soared in '99	After rising steadily since the mid-1990's, the number of fatal accidents involving Ford Explorers with tire problems more than doubled last year, a trend that provides strong indications that the overall death toll from defective Firestone tires is higher than previously reported. An analysis by The New York Times of a newly released federal database of all fatal accidents across the country in 1999 shows that 52 people died in 40 fatal crashes of Explorers in which police reports listed tire problems as a contributing factor.
9/17/2000	Ideas & Trends: Don't Tread on Me; A Road to Truth Paved With Fingerpointing	ONE of Thomas Nast's most famous political cartoons of the last days of the corrupt Tweed Ring, which ran the Tammany Hall political machine and New York City from 1866 to 1871, shows the group's leaders standing in a circle, each pointing a finger at the man to his right. The cartoon's label reads, '' 'Twas Him.'' The same refrain is being heard as Congressional investigators try to figure out what went wrong with defective Firestone tires that are blamed in close to 150 deaths around the world, mostly in Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles equipped with the tires.
9/16/2000	Questions Raised About Ford Explorer's Margin of Safety	On the wide-open highways of the South and West, drivers often push their Ford Explorers toward the vehicle's maximum speed -- 99 miles an hour -- for hours at a time. Yet the Firestone tires on millions of Explorers are certified to last only 10 minutes at a slightly higher speed -- 106 miles an hour. When those Explorers are filled with children, luggage and the many accessories of family life, the rear suspensions of sport utility vehicles are sometimes forced to carry loads that exceed the recommended weight limits, putting extra strain on the fairly small, low-pressure rear tires.
9/15/2000	Ford Chairman Speaks Out On Tires for the First Time	During his first news conference since Bridgestone/Firestone announced the recall of 6.5 million tires used mainly on Ford Explorers, William C. Ford Jr., Ford Motor's chairman, today defended his decision to let the company's president, Jacques Nasser, handle all public appearances concerning the tire problems. The company also announced that it would buy back $5 billion of its stock. Mr. Ford said it was Mr. Nasser's responsibility as the head of Ford's management team to respond to the initial recall, and once the recall became a much larger public relations and regulatory issue it would have been confusing to change.
9/15/2000	Firestone Workers Cite Lax Quality Control	In April 1990, just months before the Bridgestone/Firestone plant here began making tires for Ford Explorers, John J. Boettner, the plant manager, gave a speech at the local Kiwanis club saying that the company had spent millions to modernize the 30-year-old plant. The quality ''is the highest in the plant's history,'' Mr. Boettner said. ''And we're building the most complicated product.''
9/13/2000	Rancor Grows Between Ford And Firestone	Ford and Firestone, partners for a century, fell into bitter sniping before a Senate committee today, with top executives trading accusations about how the companies should divide responsibility for the dozens of deaths in rollover crashes involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires. The hearing was ''like tying two cats by the tail and throwing them over the clothesline and letting them claw each other,'' said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat.
9/13/2000	In Akron, the Talk Is About Treads	When the International Tire Exhibition and Conference opened here today, more than 2,500 people gathered in small meeting rooms to listen to scientists deliver papers on ''Metallic Coagents for Bonding Rubber to Metal and Synthetic Fibers'' or ''Tire Shearography.'' But try as they might to focus on such topics, they could not help talking about the Firestone controversy.
9/12/2000	Tires and Tobacco	To the Editor: Re ''More Indications Hazards of Tires Were Long Known'' (front page, Sept. 7):
9/12/2000	Documents Indicate Ford Knew Of Engine Defect but Was Silent	When thousands of car owners complained in the 1980's and 1990's that their Fords unexpectedly stalled, often on highways and while making left turns across oncoming traffic, top company executives repeatedly assured regulators that there was no way to know what might be causing the problem. But throughout the period, Ford documents show, the company's engineers, safety officials and even its board were aware of growing problems with one particular part -- a computerized ignition system attached to the engine's distributor -- that would shut the engine down if it got too hot.
9/12/2000	Table Shows Ford's Stance On Tire Limits	While the Ford Motor Company has resisted recommending a higher pressure for Firestone tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles in the United States, the automaker was moving by 1999 to start using a slightly different tire with higher pressure for Explorers in Venezuela, according to a document obtained by Congressional investigators. The document, a one-page table listing various tire specifications for a wide range of Ford models in export markets, also shows a big difference between the tires that Ford chooses for cars and the tires that it chooses for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
9/12/2000	U.S. Approves Formation of Supply Web Site for Automakers	Federal antitrust regulators approved today the establishment of an online venture that would allow five major automakers -- including the top three in America -- to buy supplies through a single Internet portal. The Federal Trade Commission approved the formation of Covisint, the business-to-business Web site, which proponents said would streamline the annual purchase of as much as $300 billion in parts for the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler A.G.
9/12/2000	Bridgestone President Admits Tire Quality-Control Problems	In his first public appearance since the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires in the United States, the president of Firestone's Japanese parent acknowledged today that the company had not paid proper attention to quality control. The president of Bridgestone, Yo ichiro Kaizaki, said the company would exert stronger control over the management of its American subsidiary, Bridgestone/Firestone, and that it would apply the same quality-control criteria for both its Bridgestone and Firestone tires.
9/11/2000	Documents Portray Tire Debacle As a Story of Lost Opportunities	More than four years before Firestone gave the Ford Motor Company or federal regulators any hint of a problem with its tires for sport utility vehicles, the company's engineers had been alerted by the State of Arizona that the tires' treads tended to separate in hot weather. More than two years before Firestone recalled the tires, its financial staff was aware of mounting warranty claims. Almost a year ago, most of Ford's management was told about deadly failures of Firestone tires on Ford Explorers overseas.
9/11/2000	Local TV Uncovered National Scandal	Local television news programs rarely break news of national consequence. In fact, they are often accused of being superficial and sensationalistic and of relying on ''scare tactic'' consumer reports whose promotional spots warn of dire consequences should viewers miss them. But it was just such a consumer report, shown on a local news program, that in large part resulted in Bridgestone/Firestone's recall of 6.5 million tires last month and the corresponding public relations crisis now engulfing it and Ford Motor.
9/11/2000	The Price of Safety	To the Editor: Robert Levy uses the case of Firestone's tires to dismiss concerns about companies that use callous cost-benefit analyses to justify keeping defective products on the market, finding it cheaper simply to pay out liability claims to those injured (Op-Ed, Sept. 8).
9/11/2000	The Price of Safety	To the Editor: Re ''More Indications Hazards of Tires Were Long Known'' (Business Day, Sept. 7):
9/8/2000	Documents Show Firestone Knew of Rising Warranty Costs	Internal documents from Bridgestone/Firestone show that officials of the company were briefed as early as February about rising warranty costs for the tires that the company recalled last month. Documents obtained by investigators working for Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is the chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, show that members of Firestone's sales staff were aware of increasing warranty claims for the company's light truck tires even as Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, told the Ford Motor Company and regulators that the tires did not have problems. The documents were distributed to members of the subcommittee in preparation for its hearing Wednesday, but were not discussed at the hearing.
9/8/2000	Link Between Tires and Crashes Went Undetected in Federal Data	Statistics from a widely used federal database show that fatal crashes involving Ford Explorers were almost three times as likely to be tire related as fatal crashes involving other sport utility vehicles. But Ford, Firestone and federal safety regulators said this week that they never detected the pattern in the data, which might have provided an early warning of problems with Firestone's tires for sport utilities. The discrepancy emerged in an analysis by The New York Times of data from the Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System. It showed that from 1995 through 1998, the most recent year available, fatal crashes involving Explorers were 2.8 times as likely to list tires as a contributing factor as those involving other S.U.V.'s.
9/8/2000	Safety Can Cost Too Much	After 88 deaths and who knows how many serious injuries, the temptation is almost irresistible to bring the boot of government down more heavily on the neck of Firestone and, by extension, other tire makers and auto-related industries. But the current environment -- perhaps best characterized as near-hysteria -- is precisely the wrong one in which to be formulating new regulations. We need to step back and take a dispassionate look at both the pluses and minuses of granting the federal government yet more authority in this area. That's not to say that Firestone and Ford should escape punishment if the evidence supports civil liability or even criminal sanctions. The government regulations that are in place must be enforced, along with common law and statutory remedies.
9/8/2000	New Volvo Trial Over Air Bags	Volvo A.B. must face a new trial in a lawsuit accusing the truck maker of installing defective air bags in sedans its former car unit made, a federal appeals court ruled. The Federal Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned a jury's decision in favor of Volvo's United States unit in a suit brought by the parents of a 6-year-old girl who died after an air bag in a Volvo 850 sedan deployed in a low-speed accident.
9/8/2000	FORD TO BUILD $400 MILLION PARTS PLANT IN CHICAGO	Ford Motor said yesterday that it planned to build a $400 million manufacturing and distribution complex for its suppliers near a Taurus and Mercury Sable plant in southeast Chicago. The new complex will add about 1,000 jobs to the area by its completion in 2003. About 2,500 hourly and salaried employees work at the nearby plant. The $400 million will be made up of investments from Ford, parts suppliers and a development partner, CenterPoint Properties. The complex is designed to provide the automaker with a steady supply of parts while reducing potential damage and the costs of shipping.
9/8/2000	Low-Profile Consumer Protection	The offices at the decaying headquarters of the government consumer protection agency here are threadbare and sparsely furnished, and the elevators do not always work. The concept of class-action suits does not exist in the local legal code, and even if it did, there is no network of consumer advocacy groups or lawyers to promote them. Tire failures and rollovers involving Bridgestone/Firestone and the Ford Motor Company have emerged as the biggest product liability controversy in years, and Venezuela as one of the scandal's main focal points. But neither the legal system nor the government regulatory structure here is prepared for a case of this magnitude, experts here agree.
9/7/2000	MORE INDICATIONS HAZARDS OF TIRES WERE LONG KNOWN	Documents released today provided additional evidence that Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was announced in August, and lawmakers began calling for tighter regulation of the auto and tire industries. The disclosures came in a long day of hearings on Capitol Hill in which Masatoshi Ono, the chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/ Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, read apologies in halting English. ''I come before you to apologize to you, the American people and especially to the families who have lost loved ones in these terrible rollover accidents,'' Mr. Ono told senators in the morning, squeezing in a reference to what some tire industry officials describe as an excessive tendency of Ford Explorers to roll over when they lose a tire.
9/7/2000	Congress Takes Up Defective Tires	The precise reason that the treads on certain Firestone tires on Ford Explorers have been peeling off with deadly consequences is not yet clear, but evidence emerging in Congressional inquiries is making it increasingly apparent that both companies were aware of the safety problems long before they took action to address them. Equally worrisome is the fact that even once the companies did act in some foreign markets, they refrained from doing so in the United States. An internal Ford memorandum written in March 1999 indicates that the companies disagreed on whether they had a legal obligation to notify American regulators about a planned recall of tires in Saudi Arabia. Ford ultimately recalled the tires but did not notify the regulators. The Ford memo suggests that Firestone opposed the Saudi recall out of concern that it would have to be reported in the United States, a contention that was vigorously denied by Firestone officials testifying before Congress yesterday. In Venezuela, Ford and Firestone face the prospect of a criminal investigation over the tires.
9/7/2000	Excerpts From a Memo About a Possible Recall	Following are excerpts from an internal Ford Motor Company memorandum dated March 12, 1999, referring to concerns about the possibility of a tire recall in Saudi Arabia. In the first section, which was made available to reporters on Tuesday, Ford indicates that Firestone opposed a recall there for fear that the tire maker would have to report it to United States regulators. The second section was blacked out by Ford when first given to Congressional investigators. Ford supplied the complete document yesterday to investigators, who provided a copy. It indicates that Ford's general counsel had similar concerns about a recall.
9/6/2000	Questions on Tire-Defect Data Arise as Hearings Draw Near	The Bridgestone/Firestone tire defect now blamed for 88 deaths, mainly in Ford Explorers, eluded detection for so long because it occurred infrequently, even though it proved deadlier than many problems that occur more often in vehicles, Ford Motor and Congressional investigators said today. The deadliness of the tire problems, combined with a low rate of warranty claims for poor quality tires, is focusing attention on whether the design of the Explorer makes it especially vulnerable, the investigators said. The high death rate associated with a fairly small number of tire failures is striking because the nation's last big tire recall, in 1978, involved Firestone tires that failed frequently but were linked to less than half as many deaths.
9/5/2000	Bridgestone, Averting Strike, Reaches Accord With Union	Negotiators for Bridgestone/Firestone and the union representing 8,000 of its workers reached a tentative settlement yesterday, averting a strike that could have deepened the tire maker's crisis. The settlement, reached at 2:30 a.m. after five days of talks, gives most union members a large pension increase and a big pay raise, ranging from 12 percent to 25 percent over three years, depending on a worker's base pay.
9/5/2000	Bridgestone Agrees to Recall 62,000 Tires in Venezuela	Facing the threat of criminal and civil actions here, Bridgestone/Firestone agreed today to recall 62,000 tires that the Venezuelan government says had defects that appear to have played a role in the deaths of at least 60 people in automobile accidents. Samuel Ruh Rios, director of the Consumer Defense and Education Institute, a government agency, announced the measure at a news conference here and praised the company, which accounts for about half of all tires sold here, calling its action ''a good sign.'' But he made it clear that Venezuela intends to press ahead with its investigation into accusations that Bridgestone knew of defects in tires manufactured here and in the United States and tried to cover them up.
9/4/2000	Congress's Part in the Firestone Crisis	As Congress begins hearings this week on the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, questions will be raised about why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn't take action sooner against Firestone and the Ford Motor Company over tire blowouts and resulting rollovers of Ford Explorers. One answer is the agency's budget, now more than 30 percent lower in real dollars than it was in 1980. A 50 percent cut during the Reagan administration still hampers the agency's capacity to regulate an ever-growing automobile industry. Congressional interference on behalf of industry in safety recall cases has also shackled the regulators, and they lack needed authority to police automakers.
9/4/2000	Stricter Rules for Tire Safety Were Scrapped by Reagan	After the last huge recall of Firestone tires in 1978, when tread separation problems resulted in hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths, Congress and regulators made a series of proposals to tighten federal tire standards. But the standards were not revised, and many of the same problems, including some that the proposals were designed to address, have arisen again in the 14.4 million Firestone tires being recalled now. A Congressional report on the 1978 recall of 14.5 million Firestone 500 tires pointed out that the steel-belted radial tires had easily passed the government's tests -- devised in the late 1960's for biased-ply tires, an earlier technology -- but still failed in large numbers on the road.
9/3/2000	Dealers Struggle to Cope With Rush to Replace Firestone Tires	Tire and car dealers struggled today to cope with customers who wanted to go on driving vacations for Labor Day weekend but were leery of relying on their Firestone tires. Dealers in hot-weather states like Texas and Florida, where the bulk of the tire problems have occurred, and in cooler states like Massachusetts said most customers this morning were owners of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles seeking to replace tires that were among the 6.5 million factory-installed tires recalled on Aug. 9.
9/2/2000	Warning Issued On More Tires From Firestone	Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., struggling to cope with a large recall and strained relations with its biggest customer, received another blow today when federal regulators warned of safety problems in many Firestone tires sold as replacements for factory-issued tires on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today that Firestone had rebuffed a request from regulators on Thursday to broaden its current tire recall. The agency took the rare step today of issuing a ''consumer advisory'' suggesting that drivers buy new tires at their own expense anyway.
9/1/2000	If It's Not One Thing, It's Another; As Tires Are Recalled, Bridgestone Faces Possible Strike	Reeling from a crisis over defective tires, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. faces the possibility of a strike tomorrow by 8,000 workers at nine American factories -- a move that could set back the company's efforts to replace 6.5 million recalled tires. Officials with the United Steelworkers of America, which represents the Bridgestone workers, said they had scheduled a strike for a minute after midnight, barring a settlement, because of the failure to reach a new contract after months of talks.
9/1/2000	Visteon Hurt by Ford Motor's Cutbacks	Shares in the Visteon Corporation fell after the company said that third-quarter earnings would be reduced by production cuts at Ford Motor because of Firestone tire recalls. Visteon, which is based in Dearborn and was spun off from Ford on June 28, fell 50 cents, to $15.69.
9/1/2000	More Tire Output Planned	Michelin of France and Continental A.G. of Germany said today that they would increase North American output of sports utility tires several times over to help replace defective Bridgestone/Fire stone tires. Production of Michelin LTX, BF Goodrich Radial Long Trail T/A and Uniroyal Laredo tires will rise more than 400 percent during the next three months at the company's plants in Ardmore, Okla.; Opelika, Ala., and Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Michelin said. Continental said its United States subsidiary, General Tire, would raise production of 15-inch sport utility tires from 50,000 to 200,000 a month.
9/1/2000	Firestone Struggles in Center Of an Ever-Widening Storm	Rarely has a leading global company faced such an extraordinary confluence of problems: its flagship product blamed for scores of deaths; its biggest customer undermining its every defense; its stock price plunging along with consumer confidence; its top executive summoned before an angry Congress. This is not how Firestone planned to celebrate its 100th birthday this summer. The centennial, some marketing experts say, has turned into a debacle for one of America's most familiar brand names.
9/1/2000	If It's Not One Thing, It's Another; Venezuela Asks Criminal Case Against Firestone and Ford	Accusing both the Ford Motor Company and Bridgestone/ Firestone of conspiring to hide tire defects that caused dozens of deaths, Venezuela's consumer protection agency asked the nation's prosecutor yesterday to bring criminal charges against both companies. The companies ''had concealed vital information from Venezuelan consumers,'' said Samuel Ruh Rios, chairman of the Venezuelan consumer agency. He said the companies were well aware that ''a macabre combination of a soft suspension and an inadequate tire'' was to blame for at least 80 accidents in which 47 people died.
8/31/2000	U.S. Expands Scope of Inquiry On Faulty Tires	Federal regulators trying to determine how much the Ford Motor Company knew about defective tires used on its Explorers expanded their investigation today by demanding that the company provide detailed information on any tire problems in 16 countries outside the United States. The disclosure was made public by regulators in a letter sent on Tuesday to Ford from officials at the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Both the agency and the automaker have come under increasing political pressure, particularly as it has become clear that for nearly two years Ford received complaints from overseas about possible problems with Firestone tires on its Explorers but did not recall them until this month. United States regulators say that they have received more than 750 complaints about the tires involving at least 62 deaths. Almost all of the deaths occurred in sport utility vehicles, mostly Explorers, that rolled over.
8/30/2000	Ford Chief Executive Declines to Testify in Congressional Inquiry on Bridgestone Tires	The Ford Motor Company said today that its chief executive and president, Jacques A. Nasser, had declined invitations to testify next week before Congressional committees investigating tire failures, mainly on Ford Explorers. This prompted criticism from one lawmaker who is leading inquiries into the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires. By contrast, Bridgestone/Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, agreed to send its chief executive, Masatoshi Ono, to testify even though he speaks limited English, Bridgestone and Congressional officials said. Bridgestone has been criticized until now for not being as open about the recall as Ford.
8/30/2000	Ford Facing Ignition Recall In California	In a ruling that could deal a blow to the Ford Motor Company, a California judge largely agreed late yesterday with complaints that Ford knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995. In a preliminary decision, Michael E. Ballachey, a Superior Court judge in Alameda County, east of San Francisco, said he intended to issue orders ''compelling recall and repair'' of the vehicles.
8/29/2000	Bridgestone Asks Venezuelan Dealers to Return Some Tires	Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced this evening that it had asked its dealers in Venezuela to return unsold 15- and 16-inch light truck tires made there, but the company rebuffed the Ford Motor Company's request for a recall of identical tires already in use in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. In May, Ford recalled its Ford Explorer and F-series pickup trucks equipped with the tires in all three countries, and the automaker said today that it had urged Bridgestone to recall other manufacturers' sport utility vehicles that use the same tires. Ford also scheduled a news conference on Tuesday in Caracas, Venezuela, to explain why the automaker thought that tire-related crashes of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela had solely been a result of defective tires and not because of any excessive tendency of Explorers to roll over.
8/28/2000	Bumpy Ride on Vehicle Safety	It has been a dismal month for those concerned about motor vehicle safety, but it brightened just a bit last week when two of the world's major automobile manufacturers took corrective action to restore consumer confidence. First the Ford Motor Company decided to cut production of its popular Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles so as to free their tires to help replace those being recalled for safety reasons on existing vehicles. Some 6.5 million Bridgestone/Firestone tires are being recalled after being linked to hundreds of accidents and 46 deaths in the United States alone. Then, Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's No. 4 automaker, admitted that it has systematically concealed customer complaints about tens of thousands of defective automobiles since 1977. Middle-level officials, anxious to avoid embarrassing recalls, covered up complaints about fuel tanks, brakes and clutches, simply by altering or hiding documents. Top management says it never knew about it. The company expanded a recall of the faulty vehicles, most of which were sold in Japan.
8/27/2000	How to Make 200 Million Flip-Flops	THE deaths and injuries attributed to failed Firestone tires are horrific, but recalling 6.5 million tires poses another problem: what to do with them once they are taken off Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles and other light trucks. If someone figured out a way to stack the tires in a column at a landfill, they would form a pile 949 miles high. The last thing anyone wants is a high-rise breeding ground for mosquitoes, particularly those carrying the West Nile virus.
8/27/2000	FIVE QUESTIONS: for BOB TASCA Sr.; On the Front Lines of the Tire Recall	BOB TASCA Sr. has kicked plenty of tires in his 73 years. He estimates that he, his sons and his grandson, who own a Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Massachusetts and a Ford dealership in Rhode Island, have sold 330,000 cars and trucks. Mr. Tasca once told Henry Ford 2nd that he made ''lousy cars.'' Since then, Mr. Tasca has made more than 600 assembly-line inspections, telling Ford Motor executives how to fix flaws. He chronicled his exploits in accountability in a book, ''You Will Be Satisfied'' (Harper Business, 1996).
8/26/2000	Ford and Dealers Start Net Retailer That Will Focus on Fixed Prices	Responding to a proliferation of Internet-based businesses selling cars, the Ford Motor Company and a council of its 4,200 Ford-brand dealers announced today that they would set up their own online retailer, FordDirect.com, to help customers find Ford vehicles at fixed prices at dealerships nationwide. The enterprise will start doing business next month in California, where customers have shown the greatest interest in online shopping, and then gradually expand to cover the entire country by sometime next year, Ford said. Dealers selling other Ford brands -- Lincoln, Mercury, Volvo, Mazda, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin -- will be invited to join the business, but Ford-brand dealers will have 80 percent voting control of the company.
8/26/2000	The Costs of Governing Less	With the money it takes from us, the government hires regulators who tell us we can't do things we want to do. Little wonder, then, that government is so often the target of profound hostility. As Adam Smith recognized, his invisible hand theory -- that society as a whole does best when everyone pursues his or her own interests in the marketplace -- works only when each person's choices cause no harm to others. Yet many of our choices clearly do harm others.
8/25/2000	Ford Attacks the Lawyers Pursuing Suits Over Tires	Officials of the Ford Motor Company lashed out today at plaintiffs' lawyers suing the automaker and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., accusing them of endangering public safety by calling for a broader recall of tires and of distributing Ford documents out of context to journalists. At a news conference this afternoon at Ford's headquarters here, executives again rejected lawyers' calls for a wider recall of 15-inch Firestone tires and for a new recall of 16-inch Firestone tires. Only the tires already recalled pose an unusual risk of failure, said Tom Baughman, Ford's engineering director for North American light trucks.
8/23/2000	Explorer Tires Had to Carry A Heavy Load	The Firestone tires that have been failing on Ford Explorers have fairly low weight-carrying capability for a vehicle of the Explorer's size, particularly at the low inflation pressure recommended by Ford Motor, publicly available technical specifications for the tires and the Explorers show. Officials at Bridgestone/Firestone have said several times over the last two weeks that the recalled 15-inch tires are losing their treads at high speeds partly because drivers are overloading their vehicles. But this can be easy to do in an Explorer: its recommended maximum payload for passengers and cargo is 750 to 1,310 pounds, depending on the model. Four people, plus luggage, can exceed the lower end of that range, particularly if they use the roof rack and the rear cargo area.
8/22/2000	Ford Reduces Output to Help Recall of Tires	With Ford Explorer owners still crowding car dealerships in search of scarce replacements for recalled Firestone tires, and with sales of new Ford Explorers beginning to slip, the Ford Motor Company said today that it would close three assembly plants for two weeks, beginning next Monday, to make an extra 70,000 tires available. Ford will shut down production of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles in St. Louis and of Ford Ranger pickup trucks in St. Paul and Edison, N.J. The Ranger uses the same type of 15-inch tires as many Ford Explorers, although virtually all of the 62 possibly tire-related deaths now under investigation by regulators have occurred in Explorers, which outsell Rangers by a wide margin.
8/21/2000	Ford Makes Tire Recall Ad	Jacques Nasser, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, is making a television commercial to address Ford's handling of a tire recall affecting the Explorer, its sport utility vehicle. Ann Doyle, a Ford spokeswoman, said the commercial would be made this weekend but would not discuss its content or when it would be broadcast. The advertisement is part of Ford's response to the recall of 6.5 million Firestone brand tires, the majority of which are on Ford sport utility vehicles. The tires have shown a high incidence of the tread separating from the rest of the tire.
8/21/2000	Blame for Tire Defects	To the Editor: Re ''Ford Says Firestone Was Aware of Flaw in Its Tires by 1997'' (front page, Aug. 14): Bridgestone/Firestone's recent recall of millions of ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires made by replacement workers at the company's Decatur, Ill., plant underscores the safety threat posed by the use of replacement workers during strikes and other labor disputes.
8/21/2000	A Familiar Terror on the Road	Will we never learn? As the Firestone tire recall gives rise to a national storm of fear and blame, I fall into a funk of deja vu. I've been here before, terrified by defective products, seeing evidence of corporate callousness, and hearing the inevitable righteous cries for change. In 1977, I stood huddled with three terrified children and another mother on the shoulder of Interstate 5 in California's Central Valley, all of us shaking as we stared at a 16-inch tear in the wall of the Firestone tire that had blown out, almost killing us. I felt shock and rage as I learned, at the gas station we limped to, that this tire was notorious for failing. I found later that the accidents were often precisely like ours: a blowout in the rear left tire of a Ford station wagon.
8/20/2000	Ford Chose Tires Now Being Recalled to Reduce Risk of Rollovers, Document Shows	An internal Ford Motor Company document obtained by lawyers suing the automaker and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. shows that the company considered using tires with higher pressure than the Firestone tires now subject to a recall, but decided against them because they increased the risk that Explorer sport utility vehicles using them would tip over. Bridgestone is recalling 6.5 million tires mounted mainly on Explorers because they are prone to losing their treads at high speeds. Federal regulators say that they have received more than 750 complaints about the tires involving at least 62 deaths. Almost all of the deaths occurred in sport utility vehicles that rolled over, mostly Explorers.
8/18/2000	In the shadow of a recall, Firestone faces questions on how to celebrate its centennial.	TIMING, as they say, is everything. This was supposed to be a jubilee year for Firestone. One hundred years ago, on Aug. 3, 1900, to be exact, Harvey S. Firestone established the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, and Firestone was planning to celebrate that fact, in a big way.
8/18/2000	Bridgestone Alters Reimbursement Limit	The Bridgestone Corporation said today that it was dropping a restriction governing when consumers can be reimbursed for the cost of replacing up to 6.5 million Firestone brand tires that are being recalled amid a United States safety investigation. Bridgestone had initially said it would repay consumers for replacement tires that were bought between Jan. 1 and Aug. 8 at company-owned or authorized retailers. The company limited the reimbursement on competitors' tires that were bought as replacements at other stores between Aug. 9 and Aug. 16.
8/18/2000	A Small-Town Lawyer Takes On Tire Makers	When Bruce R. Kaster started suing tire manufacturers more than a decade ago, he worked alone facing legions of lawyers hired by corporate conglomerates. Most often he went up against Michelin. Many cases were settled out of court, but of those that went to trial, Mr. Kaster lost more than he won. By his account, the companies' hired guns heckled him about the losses in front of his clients and stonewalled requests for information. He said they expected to wear him down until he folded and went away.
8/16/2000	Tire Deaths Are Linked To Rollovers	Government data released this evening showed that virtually all the recent deaths linked to Firestone tires now being recalled occurred when sport utility vehicles, most of them Ford Explorers, rolled over after the tires failed. Federal regulators said tonight that they had received more than 750 complaints about the failure of Firestone tires, involving 62 deaths. That is significantly more complaints and more deaths than previously announced, and more deaths than for any other safety recall involving autos or any kind of auto parts. The only recall of a comparable number of tires, another Firestone recall in 1978, followed far more complaints to regulators -- 14,000 -- but fewer deaths -- 41.
8/16/2000	Unusual Line Of Business For Lawyers	Before the recent spate of publicity about deadly accidents involving Firestone tires, Tab Turner, a Little Rock, Ark., lawyer, rarely received more than a call or two a month seeking his advice about legal claims related to defective tires. But Mr. Turner, who has spent nearly all his time the last few years on tire problems or litigation stemming from rollover accidents involving sport utility vehicles, is no longer driving in the legal slow lane.
8/15/2000	Tire Company Is Encouraged To Broaden Recall Plans	Plaintiffs' lawyers and safety advocates called on Bridgestone/Firestone today to considerably widen the scope of its recall of tires for sport utility vehicles and pickups. They contend that the tire maker and Ford Motor were misleading the public about the safety of many Firestone tires and of Ford Explorers equipped with them. The lawyers' statements highlighted an escalating squabble over how to apportion the limited numbers of replacement tires available. Ford and Firestone, a unit of the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, have tried to conduct the recall in stages, giving top priority to people in hot-weather states where Firestone's data indicates that its tires are most likely to fail.
8/15/2000	Workers Question Evidence in Tire Recall	A day after the Ford Motor Company singled out a factory here that makes Firestone tires as the main source of a problem that led to the recall of more than 6.5 million tires last week, workers and union officials said today that they were not to blame for the faulty tires. The workers said that Ford might be trying to deflect attention away from possible design flaws in its sports utility vehicles, which used the tires. They said a similar announcement last week by Bridgestone/Firestone could be a pressure tactic in the company's continuing labor negotiations with the union.
8/14/2000	Ford Says Firestone Was Aware of Flaw In Its Tires by 1997	The Ford Motor Company released documents today showing that in 1997 Bridgestone/Firestone began receiving numerous complaints of injuries and property damage involving certain Firestone tires that were not recalled until last Wednesday. Some of the recalled tires have rates of injury and personal damage claims up to 100 times greater than for tires not recalled, Ford disclosed today. Many of those claims were sent to Bridgestone by vehicle owners from 1997 to 1999, but the tire maker did not tell Ford, the company said. Ford's new automobiles, particularly Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, are equipped with two-thirds of the recalled tires.
8/11/2000	Toyota Tells British Suppliers to Use Euros Instead of Pounds	The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it had instructed British components suppliers to do business in euros instead of pounds. The move reflected the distress among automakers and other manufacturers here over the pound's high value relative to the euro, a situation that has made British exports to Europe expensive. This year, BMW of Germany pulled out of a six-year investment in the Rover Group of Britain, complaining that the pound's high value against the euro had hurt profits. The Ford Motor Company also cited the pound's strength against the euro in a decision to close a major assembly plant. The Nissan Motor Company of Japan has threatened to transfer production of a new subcompact from its plant in northeastern England. And Matsushita Electric Works of Japan has also warned it may close British plants.
8/10/2000	Ford to Offer Stability Gear For S.U.V.'s	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it would offer computerized stability systems on all of its sport utility vehicles and pickups by the 2005 model year, to improve the handling of the tall vehicles and reduce the frequency of rollovers. But the systems will be optional on many of these models, meaning that customers who want them will have to pay extra. Ford currently charges $725 for the option on its $33,000 Lincoln LS sports sedan.
8/10/2000	Tread Failures Lead to Recall Of 6.5 Million Firestone Tires	The company that makes Firestone tires said today that millions of tires it had produced since 1991 seemed unusually prone to flinging off their treads, sometimes with catastrophic results. Facing 50 lawsuits, 46 deaths, 80 injuries and a federal investigation, the company said it would provide free replacements for the 6.5 million tires still on the road. But the manufacturer, Bridgestone/Firestone, said some vehicle owners might have to wait nearly a year to get the replacements, even though the company will buy competitors' tires to meet the demands created by the recall. Some anxious consumers seeking replacements today were turned away by dealers, the supply already exhausted. About two-thirds of the tires in question came new on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks made by the Ford Motor Company over the last decade. The recall will begin in Southern and Western states, the company said, because the failures seem to be related to hot weather. But it added that it did not know why its tires seemed particularly vulnerable to the failures. In later phases, the recall will move to other regions and will be completed next year, the company said. Company officials said that all the tires they had been able to examine showed signs of underinflation, overloading, exterior damage from road debris, improper repair or other abuses. But they acknowledged that all tires produced by all manufacturers were subject to those conditions. The model names of the recalled tires are ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT, all for 15-inch wheels, with a size designation that is P235/75R15. All such ATX and ATX II tires are being recalled, but only those Wilderness AT tires that also have a Transportation Department 10-digit designation starting with the letters VD are being recalled. For reasons that the company could not explain, the Wilderness tires made in Decatur, Ill. -- the ones designated VD -- seemed prone to failure, along with ATX and ATX II tires made in a variety of plants. ''We have not identified any manufacturing or design defect,'' Gary B. Crigger, executive vice president of the company, said at a news conference. ''We're pulling this size now, rather than try to figure out what the answer is,'' he said, and the company has not had time to ''do the forensics'' on tires in accidents. Experts agreed, though, on the likely mechanism for the failure: heat, generated by tire sidewalls that flex excessively because there is too little air in the tire or too much weight on the vehicle. The problem is probably worsened by hot pavement and air temperatures, according to company officials and others. Ford said today that it became aware of the problem a year ago, with ''anecdotal reports'' from Saudi Arabia, where drivers let air out of the tires to drive on the desert, then returned to paved roads and drove at high speeds without reinflating the tires. Ford has offered free replacements in several countries with hot climates. Bridgestone/Firestone, which is the United States unit of the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, acted in this country today after extensive discussions with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Ford. Bridgestone would not disclose the cost of the recall. The deputy head of the safety administration, Rosalyn G. Millman, said in a statement that she was pleased that Firestone ''has taken a positive step toward resolving this safety issue.'' But a spokesman for the agency, Rae Tyson, said that its investigation had begun only in May and that the agency did not know enough now to order a recall. Mr. Tyson said that the agency had begun its inquiry primarily because of an increasing number of complaints from consumers and that in recent days, as news reports cited the failures, the number of complaints rose sharply. The number of deaths being investigated as part of the agency's inquiry increased to 46 from 21 in the last week. ''I don't think anyone would want us to jump to any conclusions based on an investigation that just began,'' Mr. Tyson said. A crucial question for investigators looking into cases in which vehicles rolled over and had damaged tires is whether the tires were the cause, he said. But some critics said the government response had been slow. The safety agency has had weak leadership and has been preoccupied with other issues, including faulty rear-door latches on minivans, and sidesaddle gas tanks on pickups, said Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the highway safety agency and now director of Public Citizen, the consumer rights group. Ms. Claybrook said the companies had also been derelict. ''The first lawsuits they settled were back in 1992, and they've known about this for years,'' she said. ''They settled them with gag orders,'' she added. ''This has been a big cover-up for years.'' Mr. Crigger of Firestone said the company was facing 50 lawsuits. Asked whether secrecy clauses in the settlement agreements were intended to cover up the problem, Mr. Crigger said, ''I don't know about the status'' of such clauses. In some suits, one question is whether the vehicles' suspension, which Ford designed, is partly responsible. Ms. Claybrook said that the failures echoed a problem with tread on Firestone 500 tires that arose in 1978, when she was the administrator of the safety agency. That case, which also involved a large recall, was a severe financial blow to Firestone and was one reason it was acquired in 1988 by Bridgestone. Of the tires affected by the announcement today, about two-thirds came new on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles and Ranger and F-150 pickup trucks, Mercury Mountaineer sport utilities, as well as Mazda Navajo and B-series pickups. All were produced between 1991 and 2000. But millions of other tires were sold as replacements on other makes of vehicles. General Motors and Subaru, two other manufacturers that use Firestone for original equipment tires, said they had not had any reports of problems. The problem, in fact, may be related in part to the vehicle, although statistics were sketchy today. Explorers may predominate among the accidents because the vehicle is so popular. In addition, a tire failure in an Explorer may be a bigger problem than in other vehicles, said David A. Champion, the director of auto testing for Consumer Reports magazine. ''S.U.V.'s are more prone to roll over than other classes of vehicles because of the high center of gravity,'' he said. Thus a tire failure that causes an accident ''can be more dramatic'' in a sport utility vehicle. Ford said it still stood by its longtime supplier -- Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone were close friends and business associates nearly a century ago. But today, the tire maker and the carmaker gave slightly different advice to owners of Explorers that have the tires. Ford said the tires should be inflated to 26 to 30 pounds per square inch, and Firestone said 30. And though Ford first heard reports of a problem a year ago, a top Ford executive complained today that it had taken until late last month for Firestone to turn over data on its warranty experience with the tires provided on new Fords. (Manufacturers use warranty complaints to track defects, but tire warranties are customarily separate from vehicle warranties.) Ford said it requested the data from Firestone amid growing concerns about information accumulating in the investigation by the highway safety agency. ''It's only fairly recently that we had enough data to do detailed analysis,'' said Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president for North American automotive operations. He vowed that this would change. ''Whether they warrant the tires or we warrant the tires, we will share the information,'' he said. Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said that when Ford learned of the problems overseas, it bought some Wilderness tires from American customers who had driven them 30,000 to 40,000 miles, giving them new tires in exchange. Ford engineers then drove them in Arizona in February, trying to duplicate the tire failures, but they did not fail. Ford concluded that the tires were fine and that the problem lay in how the tires were used overseas, particularly in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Harmon said. Mr. Inglis said Ford had asked every tire manufacturer in the world if it could supply some of the tires needed to replace the ones being recalled. Tires were moving briskly today. In Jacksonville, Fla., Dennis Perkins, parts manager at Mike Davidson Ford, hustled to secure tires in anticipation of an onslaught of customers. He said he called a Goodyear warehouse at 1 p.m. and was told it had 5,000 Wrangler RTS tires, a potential substitute, in stock. When he called back at 1:45 p.m. all 5,000 were gone. In Lubbock, Tex., ''I have had at least 40 calls today,'' said Judy Stanley, the telephone operator at Gene Messer Ford. ''Their first question is, 'What am I going to do?' They are worried.'' She added: ''I give them the 800 number to Firestone. I don't know where it's going from there.'' (Firestone said today that its 800 number was jammed.) At Manhattan Ford, at 787 11th Avenue near 55th Street, Steve Huang drove up in a midnight-blue Mercury Mountaineer that he had bought there last week, complete with Firestone AT Wilderness tires. He reacted indifferently to the news. ''Recalls happen, and they are usually handled responsibly,'' said Mr. Huang, who sells surveillance cameras. ''I'm not worried. This is a great car, and it handles great.''
8/4/2000	Ford Gives The Top S.U.V. A Full Makeover	AMERICA'S best-selling sport utility, the Ford Explorer, is getting its first total redesign since it arrived on the market in 1990. Changes on the 2002 Explorer, which goes on sale early next year, have resulted in more room, an improved ride and more comfort and safety features. Styling changes are subtle: The headlamps and taillamps are larger and the body's lines are more defined. But its sibling S.U.V., the Mercury Mountaineer, looks significantly different from the current model and from the Explorer. It has sharper lines and brushed metal trim on the lights and grille.
8/4/2000	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Safety; Poor Crash Results for 2 Popular Cars	TWO of the nation's most popular new vehicles, the Chrysler PT Cruiser and Ford Focus ZX3, have fared badly in government crash tests. The PT Cruiser received what amounts to a poor rating -- two stars of a possible five -- for its ability to protect the head of a driver wearing a safety belt in a front collision, according to results released recently by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The two-door Focus ZX3 got just one star -- the lowest possible rating -- for protecting a rear passenger in a side crash.
8/4/2000	Changes in Ford Explorer Aim at Protecting Other Motorists	The Ford Motor Company said today that its next generation of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, scheduled to go on sale in January, would be extensively changed from current models so as to reduce the danger to other motorists during collisions and decrease the risk of deadly rollovers. The sturdy frame that runs the length of the Explorer, the nation's best-selling sport utility vehicle, will be as low at the front of the vehicle as that of Ford Taurus sedans, considerably reducing the risk that the sport utility vehicles will override cars' bumpers and door sills in crashes, Ford officials said. And the front foot or so of the frame will absorb more energy in a high-speed crash, reducing the risk of injury in both vehicles.
8/3/2000	Detroit's Use of Steel	To the Editor: In ''Ford Said to Plan Improved Mileage in Sport Utilities'' (front page, July 27), you report that ''lighter auto parts are usually more expensive, because they need to be made from aluminum instead of steel.'' Over the last six years, the global steel industry has demonstrated the untapped potential of steel to reduce the weight of auto components at no cost premium through its series of ''ultralight steel auto body'' initiatives. Ford and other vehicle makers have been increasing their use of advanced high-strength steels and processing technologies to save weight, improve performance and safety, and reduce cost.
8/3/2000	General Motors Raises Stakes in Fuel Economy War with Ford	General Motors challenged Ford today to a battle over which company can deliver bigger improvements in fuel economy, particularly for sport utility vehicles, the least efficient vehicles of all. Ford committed itself last week to improve the average mileage of its sport utility vehicles by almost five miles a gallon over the next five years. General Motors announced today that no matter how much Ford improved the energy efficiency of its sport utilities by 2005, G.M.'s sport utilities would average even more miles to the gallon by then.
8/3/2000	Ford in Talks to Build a Small Car in China	The Ford Motor Company is deep in negotiations with the Changan Automobile Group to build an affordable passenger car in China, the latest in a series of signs that the country is loosening its grip on the auto industry ahead of its expected entry into the World Trade Organization later this year. Ford has tried for years to get into the Chinese market after having lost to General Motors in a fierce competition in the mid-90's for the last major car deal sanctioned under the government's auto-industry master plan. After G.M. won the right to build Buicks in Shanghai, officials started talking instead about shutting manufacturers down. China has more than 100 car manufacturers, including those that assemble cars using kits imported from abroad.
8/2/2000	Car Sales Rise, Except at G.M. And Chrysler	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler said today that their sales fell in July, leaving both automakers unable to reduce their bloated inventories of unsold minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But Ford and foreign automakers announced strong sales last month and balanced inventories. Overall industry sales were very strong. While they did not quite match the torrid pace early this year, they were still brisk enough to suggest that consumer spending remained a powerful force in the American economy during July.
8/1/2000	FORD AND QUALCOMM FORM VENTURE	In a deal that would bring wireless services like the Internet and entertainment to automobiles, Ford Motor said that it had entered a joint venture with Qualcomm. The new company, tentatively called Wingcast, will be based in San Diego, Qualcomm's home. Ford and Qualcomm have equity stakes, although terms were not disclosed. Ford expects more than a million of its new cars and trucks to be equipped for wireless services by the end of 2002.
7/28/2000	Ford Says Research Inspired New Push for Fuel Economy	For years, automakers insisted that the technology did not exist to improve the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles and that Americans were not especially interested in gas mileage. But today, the Ford Motor Company reversed course and announced plans to improve the gas mileage of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over five years, or roughly five miles a gallon, saying that the technology already exists to do so and that customers actually want better fuel economy.
7/28/2000	Ford's Clean Air Breakthrough	The various industries responsible for much of the country's air pollution -- the oil companies, the automakers, the big utilities -- have usually resisted federal clean air regulations, routinely overestimating the costs of the regulations while underestimating the ability of their engineers to satisfy them. In the 30 years since the passage of the Clean Air Act, industry has rarely been out in front of government. Yesterday, however, the Ford Motor Company reversed this paradigm with the announcement that it would increase the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the next five years. It did so even though Congress recently rejected yet another effort by environmentalists to tighten up fuel economy standards. The company's move deserves applause from anyone who worries about carbon dioxide, a so-called greenhouse gas that is thought to be a major contributor to global warming. Cars and trucks are responsible for about one-third of the carbon dioxide produced in the United States, and S.U.V.'s are responsible for a big chunk of that. S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and vans now account for half the vehicles sold in America. This has been a boon for Detroit but not for cleaner air, mainly because S.U.V.'s, which are officially classed as light trucks, have been allowed to emit up to three times as much pollution per mile as standard cars. They also consume about one-third to one-half more fuel than ordinary cars.
7/27/2000	FORD SAID TO PLAN IMPROVED MILEAGE IN SPORT UTILITIES	The Ford Motor Company has decided to increase the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the next five years, people involved in the company's plans said today. The increase, amounting to roughly five miles a gallon, would be the first significant change in the fuel economy of any class of passenger vehicle in almost two decades. Ford is convinced that Americans want to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles and will steer their purchases to companies they perceive as environmentally responsible, the people said. The company's new stance is also a response to environmental concerns about the automobile's role in global warming.
7/25/2000	FORD TO SELL BELARUS PLANT	The world's second-largest carmaker, the Ford Motor Company, will sell its 51 percent stake in its Belarussian joint venture, as sales in the former Soviet Union still suffer from the ruble's 1998 devaluation. The sale for an undisclosed price to J & W Sanderson Ltd., a British plastic injection-molding manufacturer, may be completed next week. Ford stopped assembling Escort cars and Transit minivans at the plant near Minsk two months ago because of low demand.
7/20/2000	CAREY INTERNATIONAL TO BE ACQUIRED BY PRIVATE GROUP	Carey International Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to be acquired by a private investment group backed by the Ford Motor Company and Chartwell Investments II for $18.25 a share, or a total of $177.8 million. Carey, based in Washington, provides chauffeured limousine, van and minibus services in 480 cities in 75 countries. It had revenue of $115.9 million in the six months that ended on May 31. Chartwell is a New York-based private equity firm. Carey's shares rose $3.4375 each, to $17.9375, in Nasdaq trading.
7/20/2000	Havas Unit Named For Volvo in Europe	The Volvo Car Corporation in Goteborg, Sweden, owned by the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday that it had expanded its relationship with Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York by naming the agency as the lead shop to handle its strategic and creative advertising for Pan-European markets. Billings were estimated at $50 million. Messner Vetere, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, adds the Pan-European duties to the North American Volvo account it already handles, with billings estimated at $100 million. The decision came after an informal three-month review that had been narrowed to Messner Vetere and three other agencies: Leagas Delaney in London; Wieden & Kennedy in London; and 180 in Amsterdam.
7/20/2000	Ford, Sued in Air-Bag Case, Says Victim Was Strangled	The Ford Motor Company, accused by a New Jersey man of killing his wife when her air bag inflated in a crash three years ago, is defending itself by asserting that the woman was actually strangled. Ford's assertion has enraged the woman's husband and his lawyers, who are seeking to expand a lawsuit to include defamation charges against the automaker. Ford, the lawyers said yesterday, should pay heavy punitive damages for trying to avoid responsibility for a faulty product by tacitly suggesting that their client murdered his wife.
7/20/2000	Charges Offset Strong Results At Ford Motor	The Ford Motor Company said today that brisk sales of luxury cars and sport utility vehicles and growing profit from auto loans and leases lifted its operating earnings in the second-quarter. But a pair of one-time charges announced last week caused the automaker to post its first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 1992. Excluding the one-time charges, Ford's after-tax earnings from operations rose 8.5 percent, to $2.69 billion. Per-share earnings from continuing operations rose 10 percent, to $2.20, beating by 12 cents the consensus forecast of analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
7/16/2000	Is It Bold and New, Or Just Tried and True?; Chrysler Plays It Safe in Minivan Redesign	SINCE the early 1980's, Chrysler has cultivated a reputation for daring, innovative designs, beating bigger rivals by creating the minivan market and by revitalizing the full-size pickup truck market with the burly Dodge Ram. Just this year, its new PT Cruiser, an eccentric combination of a 1930's gangster car and a minivan, has been such a hot seller that dealers across the country have months-long waiting lists. So four years ago, when Chrysler formed a team to start designing the next generation of minivans for introduction late this summer, the pressure was fierce to come up with another big step forward. After all, Chrysler invented the traditional minivan in 1983, producing a vehicle that Ford Motor and General Motors had studied for years but never had the courage to build. Chrysler has dominated the minivan market ever since with breakthroughs like the introduction of driver's-side sliding doors in 1995.
7/14/2000	Ford Needs a Better Idea for Getting Cash to Shareholders	THE Ford Motor Company figures it has too much cash on its hands and thinks its shares are undervalued. So it plans to distribute $10 billion to its owners. So far so good. If Ford were a normal company, it would simply declare a special dividend or buy back a lot of shares. Instead, it is undertaking a bizarrely complicated transaction that calls for Ford to be acquired by another company, known as the Ford Value Corporation. Shareholders will get stock in the new company plus their choice of $20 a share in cash or additional shares. Those who take cash will get smaller dividend checks in the future.
7/14/2000	Charges From Spinoff Will Give Ford a Loss	The Ford Motor Company will take $3.3 billion in charges for costs of spinning off its Visteon Corporation parts unit and reorganizing its European business, resulting in its first quarterly loss since the end of 1992. The one-time charges -- $2.3 billion for Visteon and $1 billion for Europe -- will reduce Ford's second-quarter profit by about $2.70 a share. The company is expected to report Wednesday that its profit from continuing operations was $2.01 a share, according to the average forecast of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
7/4/2000	Big U.S. Automakers' Sales Dropped 1.4% Last Month	Americans bought fewer autos from General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler than expected in June, opting to buy vehicles made by Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they own. Sales of North American-built cars and trucks fell 5.8 percent at G.M. and 3.1 percent at Ford. DaimlerChrysler, beset by an aging minivan lineup, said its sales excluding Mercedes-Benz fell 9.8 percent.
6/30/2000	Ford Is Selected as the Bidder to Enter Daewoo Talks	The Ford Motor Company won exclusive rights today to negotiate the purchase of South Korea's ailing Daewoo Motor Company with a $6.9 billion offer that if successful would be Ford's largest foreign acquisition and could significantly strengthen its operations in Asia. Ford, the world's second-largest automaker, outbid rivals including the top-ranked General Motors Corporation for the right to negotiate a purchase of Daewoo from its creditors.
6/29/2000	FORD SAID TO LEAD IN DAEWOO BID	South Korean news reports said Ford Motor had won exclusive negotiating rights to buy the heavily indebted Daewoo Motor from a committee of creditors, beating out rival bids from an alliance between DaimlerChrysler and Hyundai Motor and an alliance between General Motors and Fiat. The Korea Economic Daily said the Ford and Daimler-Hyundai bids were each about $6 billion and the G.M.-Fiat bid was lower. G.M. said its alliance was still bidding. None of the other companies or the creditors would comment on the reports. Samuel Len
6/29/2000	Ford and Toyota Test the Sale of Cars Online in Canada	Canada has become a laboratory for the automobile industry's experiment with selling cars to consumers over the Internet. The Canadian subsidiaries of Ford Motor and Toyota Motor have established test Web sites to let consumers in three regions of the country log onto the Internet to buy vehicles -- tests that could foreshadow the parent companies' global strategies.
6/22/2000	Cries of racism in the filming of a commercial ensnare Ford in actors' strike against ad agencies.	STUNG by accusations of racism for having used makeup to darken the face of a white stunt driver in the filming of a television commercial, the Ford Motor Company said late yesterday that it would postpone making new commercials until a nationwide strike by unionized actors against advertising agencies is resolved. Ford also said it would review its makeup policies. Ford, one of the nation's largest advertisers, acknowledged criticism by the actors' unions that its advertising agency, Young & Rubicam, darkened the nonunion driver's face during the filming of a commercial for the Lincoln LS sports sedan on Saturday in Palm Springs, Calif.
6/16/2000	Efficiency on Wheels; U.S. Auto Industry Is Catching Up With the Japanese	The Ford Taurus factory in Atlanta has no air-conditioning to ward off the sweltering heat of the Georgia summer. Its scuffed concrete floors and sooty ceiling beams hold the grit of 53 years of car-building. On the assembly line, orange robots weld car roofs and sides and, farther down, hundreds of men and women install the cars' interiors. To all appearances, it is an utterly ordinary car factory. Yet the Atlanta plant is, in fact, special. According to a highly regarded annual study released yesterday, it was the most efficient in North America last year, representing the first time that an American-owned auto plant has surpassed Japanese-owned factories on this continent in labor productivity.
6/11/2000	Tech 2010: #04 Safe And Sound; The Car That Can't Crash	Research on developing safer cars and latest accident-preventing devices explained; photo; many of ideas that will revolutionize driving experience are dreamed up on giant automobile campuses like Ford Scientific Research Laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan (M)
6/9/2000	Big Carmakers Extend Benefits To Gay Couples	General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division announced today that they would begin offering medical, dental and prescription drug benefits for same-sex partners of their 466,000 hourly and salaried employees in the United States, the largest move yet by corporate America to provide such benefits for gay and lesbian couples. Many companies in the financial, media, entertainment and airline industries and some state and local governments have offered same-sex benefits in the last several years. But gay and lesbian advocates said the automakers' decisions dwarfed previous corporate moves and were particularly welcome because Midwestern companies have been slow to provide such benefits.
6/2/2000	With Loophole, Carmakers Post Mileage Gain	A soon-to-be- released government report shows a slight increase in the fuel economy of family vehicles in the 2000 model year. But the rise is mostly thanks to a loophole that gives carmakers extra mileage credit for vehicles that can run on ethanol, even though virtually no one uses that fuel. Ethanol is sold by only 108 of the nation's 178,000 service stations. Nonetheless, General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are producing roughly 750,000 dual-fuel minivans, small pickup trucks and cars this year at an extra cost of up to $300 each. These vehicles are counted by the government as getting roughly triple the gas mileage that they actually achieve, allowing manufacturers to sell more full-sized sport utilities and pickups while still meeting federal standards for average fuel economy.
6/2/2000	Auto Sales Declined 2% Last Month	Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors entirely accounted for the decline as other manufacturers posted record sales, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun. Only one in five buyers of new family vehicles pays cash; the rest rely on loans or leases, for which the monthly payments vary with interest rates. As a result, the auto industry is usually one of the first to feel the effects when the Federal Reserve starts pushing up interest rates, as it has done in recent months. Many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, have long watched for weak auto sales as an early indicator that the American economy might be slowing.
6/2/2000	Ford Adds to Warranty On Engine-Gasket Flaw	IN a move that consumer advocates say could benefit owners of all brands of vehicles, the Ford Motor Company has agreed to cover head-gasket repairs for some rear-wheel-drive cars with the 3.8-liter V-6 engine. Ford had announced in February that it would pay for repairs on about 718,000 front-drive automobiles with that engine: the 1994-95 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, the 1994 Lincoln Continental and the 1995 Ford Windstar. But the rear-drive cars -- Ford Mustangs, Mercury Cougars and Ford Thunderbirds from the 1994-95 model years -- were excluded. Some consumers were stuck with bills ranging from $1,600 for gasket repairs to $4,000 for destroyed engines.
6/1/2000	CANADIAN AUTO SUBSIDIES	A World Trade Organization appeals panel has upheld a ruling against Canada's laws on importing automotive products. It affirmed a decision last fall that a 1965 Canada-United States auto pact violated free trade rules by giving subsidies to American manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors. Toyota Canada issued a statement urging the Canadian government to lower duties for all manufacturers or force American automakers to repay the ''illegal subsidies they have received over the past few years.'' Elizabeth Olson
5/30/2000	S.U.V. Suits Still Face Long Odds	While the Ford Motor Company recently acknowledged that sport utility vehicles can be hazardous to other motorists, law professors and plaintiff lawyers say that it remains difficult to win lawsuits based on the damage that sport utilities inflict in crashes. Trial lawyers and automakers say that they are aware of only one lawsuit so far in which a car occupant has sued the manufacturer of the sport utility that hit her. That case, against Land Rover, was summarily dismissed in January by a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles who concluded that the automaker had no legal duty to consider what would happen to other vehicles and motorists struck by its products.
5/25/2000	BMW COMPLETES ROVER SALE	The German automobile company BMW wound up its withdrawal from Britain's money-losing Rover Group by completing the sale of Rover's sport utility vehicle division to the Ford Motor Company for three billion euros ($2.73 billion) -- two-thirds to be paid immediately and the rest in 2005. Since the price was agreed on March 16, the euro has fallen 6.1 percent against the dollar, meaning that Ford's initial payment will be worth $1.82 billion, compared with $1.94 billion on March 16. Alan Cowell (NYT)
5/19/2000	To Sweep Those S.U.V.'s Off the Highways	To the Editor: Everybody agrees that sport utility vehicles are hazardous to those riding in cars, but Robert Frank's suggestion for imposing a weight tax on these truck-like vehicles is not the answer (''Feeling Crash-Resistant in an S.U.V.,'' Op-Ed, May 16). Those who could afford the tax would still drive an S.U.V. Those who could not would have to sacrifice safety, and the number of lighter vehicles on the road would be increased.
5/18/2000	Weak Demand Prompts Ford To Produce Fewer Excursions	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would produce fewer Ford Excursion sport utility vehicles during the 2001 model year, but attributed the cutback to weak consumer demand for the vehicle rather than the company's concerns about its safety and environmental problems. George Pipas, a Ford spokesman, said that the automaker would cut its production rate for the Excursion to 52,000 a year this summer, from 69,000 a year now. By building 17,000 fewer Excursions, Ford will be able to build 35,000 more Ford Super Duty pickup trucks, which are produced on the same assembly line in Louisville, Ky., he said.
5/16/2000	To Rid Our Roads of Sport Utilities	To the Editor: Re ''Ford Is Conceding S.U.V. Drawbacks'' (front page, May 12): Any thinking person knows that sport utility vehicles endanger the environment and other motorists, but we can hardly blame the Ford Motor Company for continuing to make them when they are so profitable. The alternative is for Ford to build smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, which the average American apparently does not want and will probably not buy.
5/16/2000	Feeling Crash-Resistant in an S.U.V.	Each year for the past decade, the automaker that has offered the biggest lineup of heavyweight sport utility vehicles has won a huge sales and profit windfall. S.U.V.'s now account for some 20 percent of all vehicles sold by Ford (up from 5 percent in 1990), and brisk sales of the company's massive new Excursion have been generating profits of roughly $18,000 per vehicle, several times the margin for passenger cars. By one recent estimate, the Excursion and other jumbo vehicles accounted for most of Ford's record profit of $7.2 billion last year. Now, William Clay Ford Jr., the company's chairman and the great-grandson of founder Henry Ford, has begun to voice second thoughts. An ardent environmentalist, he concedes that the Excursion's fuel consumption (10 miles per gallon in the city, 13 on the highway) helps worsen global warming, and that its bulk (more than 7,500 pounds -- three times as heavy as a Honda Civic) puts other motorists at risk.
5/15/2000	Ford Motor's Environmental Candor	The Ford Motor Company offered a surprisingly honest assessment last week of the environmental and safety hazards of sport utility vehicles, one of the company's most profitable products. The assessment, in the company's ''corporate citizenship report'' to shareholders, may herald an era of heightened environmental consciousness at the industrial giant in response to consumer demands for safer, more socially responsible vehicles. S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickup trucks are allowed under current federal law to emit substantially more smog-creating tailpipe gases than cars. This loophole in the law threatens to destroy gains in air quality because these big vehicles now make up nearly half of all new vehicle purchases. They are less fuel efficient than cars, and therefore generate more greenhouse gases. They also pose special dangers for passengers in other cars during crashes because of their size and design.
5/14/2000	The Message vs. the Machine	Where does one of the nation's best-known smokestack companies hold its annual meeting when it wants to demonstrate a new commitment to the environment? Under Mr. Ford, an outspoken environmentalist, Ford Motor chose the Atlanta Zoo. Situated near Ford's Taurus assembly plant and heavily dependent on Ford sponsorship for the last 15 years, the zoo had a large tent decorated like a jungle to show off prototype car models, while the platform for Mr. Ford and other company leaders was fringed with bamboo. Mr. Ford announced his desire to make sport utilities safer and environmentally friendlier. But some of the futuristic models on display sent a different message. About 25 yards from the podium was a Ford Equator, an experimental vehicle with a short pickup bed, that is essentially an even wider version of the already substantial Ford Expedition. Ford officials say no decision has been made on whether to mass-produce the Equator. KEITH BRADSHER
5/14/2000	Why G.M. Is Getting A Cold Shoulder	THE car business is booming these days -- in Europe, Mexico and Brazil as well as in the United States -- and the shares of General Motors have climbed nearly 17 percent so far this year. Of course, G.M. has major technology exposure in the form of its Hughes Electronics business. (While G.M. owns all of Hughes's assets, G.M.'s class H shares are designed to track the unit's earnings independently.) Even with G.M.'s run-up, however, its stock trades at less than nine times projected earnings, scarcely one-third the average multiple accorded the Dow industrials.
5/13/2000	Ford's Admission Perplexes the Neighbors in Henry's Hometown	The doors and floor mats at City Hall here proudly bear the logo, ''Home Town of Henry Ford.'' The Ford Motor Company's headquarters, an immense rectangle of glass and steel in a community of two-story homes, is a mile down the street, and the company's endless office parks, factories and test tracks cover most of the landscape. So people in this southwest suburb of Detroit tend to support Ford, and they expressed little shock at the company's frank admission on Thursday that sport utility vehicles cause serious safety and environmental problems. They focused on Ford's vow to improve the big vehicles' tailpipe emissions and fuel economy and find ways to make them less dangerous in crashes with cars.
5/13/2000	Ford to Close British Plant, Laying Off 1,900 Workers	With Britain's automotive industry swinging from crisis to crisis, the Ford Motor Company announced today that it would close its biggest car assembly plant in this country by early 2002 with a loss of 1,900 jobs. Ford attributed the move to what it called the company's ''totally unacceptable'' financial performance in the whole of Europe. Nick Scheele, the company's chairman for Europe, said Ford's plants in Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium had the capacity to produce 2.2 million cars last year, but sold only 1.65 million, earning only $28 million on sales of $30 billion.
5/12/2000	FORD IS CONCEDING S.U.V. DRAWBACKS	The Ford Motor Company, which depends on sport utility vehicles for much of its profit, acknowledged today that they cause serious safety and environmental problems. In its first ''corporate citizenship report,'' issued at the company's annual shareholders' meeting here, Ford said that the vehicles contributed more than cars to global warming, emitted more smog-causing pollution and endangered other motorists. The automaker said that it would keep building them because they provide needed profit, but would seek technological solutions to the problems and look for alternatives to the big vehicles.
5/11/2000	NO LAYOFFS, G.M. PROMISES DAEWOO	Vowing there would be no layoffs at the Daewoo Motor Company, Jack Smith, the chairman of General Motors, tried to win support for its bid to acquire the ailing South Korean carmaker. The rival bidder Ford Motor has made similar promises. Samuel Len
5/9/2000	The Long, Long Wait for Cars; Automakers Try to Speed Process of Ordering Vehicles	Order a personal computer online or over the phone, choosing every specification, and it will be assembled and shipped to your door in five or six days. But try to order a car from the factory that way, and watch out. Buyers who place such orders face stupefyingly complex forms asking them about sometimes obscure features like axle ratios for towing. The few brave enough to fill out the paperwork -- most automakers have yet to computerize the process -- then face a wait long enough to try anyone's patience: three weeks to three months or more.
5/8/2000	With Its E-Mail Infected, Ford Scrambled And Caught Up	Kevin J. Timms, the Ford Motor Company's 37-year-old computer security manager, arrived at work here in his metallic blue Mercury Cougar at 6:45 on Thursday morning, a not-uncommon hour for managers at Midwest manufacturers. He was just walking into his office when the phone rang. Roger Chapman, the manager of Ford's computer center in Warley, England, had determined that a new, malignant computer program was spreading swiftly across Ford's global e-mail network. He suggested that the entire network be shut down for the first time. Mr. Timms agreed, and told his staff to proceed.
5/7/2000	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Explorer Sport Trac; Just the Thing for Nocturnal Hauls at Harvard	AT 4:30 a.m. on a winter Saturday, I came to understand the value of a Ford Explorer Sport Trac. Around 1:30 that morning, two buddies and I decided to drive here from Boston -- the kind of misguided but enthusiastic idea that college students generate in the middle of the night. Three hours and three turnpikes later, I considered myself lucky to be driving a 2001 Sport Trac, possibly the only vehicle that could keep us excited about our dawn excursion as we plowed through four feet of snow along Maine's back roads. Until then, the Sport Trac didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. With its pickup-truck frame, carlike interior and four feet of big-enough-for-your-bikes-and-not-much-else cargo space, this Explorer derivative is more likely to make you say ''What the heck?'' than ''How useful!'' Ford's new car-truck-S.U.V. may seem like the biggest compromise since the bicameral legislature, but for buyers who can't be pigeon-holed into a particular lifestyle, the Sport Trac, which went on sale early this year, may be a pleasant surprise. Take our trip, for example: In Boston's parking lots and side streets, I wouldn't have wanted a giant sport utility. Amid the maniacal 2 a.m. drivers on the Massachusetts and New Hampshire turnpikes, I wanted something with more authority than a car or station wagon. And on icy, winding rural highways, I wouldn't have wanted a light pickup. In addition to handling the challenges our impromptu road trip posed, the Sport Trac simply appealed to some aspect of our disposition -- we are easily seduced by advertising -- as a great choice for fast-paced, unorthodox travel. For daily living, the Sport Trac works just as well. With a frame 40 percent stiffer than the Explorer's, larger brake rotors and a specially tuned suspension, it actually rides more comfortably than its sister model with an enclosed cargo area. Although Ford is marketing the Sport Trac as a sport utility, anybody who sees it is going to call it a truck -- a less trendy but more accurate label. And with rear leaf springs and typically truckish rear-end lightness, it feels like a truck. (In fact, after the four-door Explorer is redesigned for the 2001 model year, the Sport Trac will have more in common with the Ranger pickup.) Drivers won't have many gripes about performance; the chief complaint is likely to be the lack of a V-8. The switch-operated four-wheel drive (worth the extra $3,000 over the 4-by-2 model) provides outstanding traction in all conditions. And the engine (a 4-liter V-6 with 205 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque) produces competent acceleration and enough low-end pull to handle heavy cargo. On the issue of cargo, the bed could be described as either problematic (in the sense that it simply doesn't have much room) or innovative (made of dentproof, rustproof composite plastic). The nearly square cargo box measures 50 by 41 inches on the inside, which will handle a Jet Ski or a washing machine, but is not big enough for a sofa or the archetypal sheet of plywood. The plastic bed is a great convenience when you consider that most other trucks have painted steel beds that stay unblemished only if they wear after-market plastic liners. In addition, many buyers will opt for the supplemental cargo cage, which attaches to the opened tailgate and adds a couple extra feet of length. A hard, locking tonneau cover, which fits over the bed, is an option. And with just an ounce or two of creativity, owners who haul stuff frequently might realize that the Sport Trac may actually be a better choice than a regular pickup. Take my needs, for example. As a drummer who moves musical equipment from gig to gig, I can toss heavy-duty gear like drums and amplifiers in the bed and store more fragile stuff in the spacious back seat. That seat is a blessing in and of itself. If you see the Sport Trac as a sport utility, the 60-40 split bench really isn't interesting or surprising. But if you see it as a truck -- and it is a truck -- the rear seat is a welcome change with its ample space (there is more than 3 feet of legroom), adjustable headrests and standard power windows. And if two people ride in back, each gets his or her own door. The interior design is modern, though the black numbers on white dials of the instrument cluster may not be to everyone's taste. Notable features include Berber floor mats over a rubber floor covering (which can be cleaned almost effortlessly with a wet rag) and titanium accents on the door handles. A cute interior bonus is a soft pack on the console that doubles as a removable sport bag. You can fit Power Bars, bottled water and motivational tapes in there or in the two hidden storage bins behind the rear seat. What you won't be able to fit in the Sport Trac are many young buyers. With sticker prices close to $30,000 (the test truck was $28,205), the possibility of owning this vehicle will seem as distant as retirement to all but the most blue-blooded 20-somethings. Perhaps this isn't Ford's target market, but the company does pitch the car as a dream-come-true for people with ''active lifestyles.'' Whatever that means, Ford's pricing may keep the Sport Trac out of the hands of recent college graduates looking for primary vehicles. Still, buyers get a lot for their money. The Sport Trac has loads of standard goodies (CD player, power everything, neat interior) for those who can afford it. And, as a final bonus, it just might inspire you to load up your Funkadelic CD's and take an early-morning road trip. INSIDE TRACK: New DNA in the automotive gene pool.
5/3/2000	Auto Sales Keep to Torrid Pace Even as Loan Costs Rise	Rising interest rates, a volatile stock market and higher gasoline prices were expected to be slowing the American economy by now, especially the highly cyclical auto industry. Yet the stampede into the showrooms continues across the country, with every big domestic and foreign automaker announcing today that sales last month exceeded even last year's brisk pace. The buyers are people like Frank DiBernardino, a 52-year-old human resources consultant in Glen Mills, Pa., who bought a huge, indigo blue GMC Yukon for $42,300 last month. Interest rate increases did not affect him, he said, because he wrote a check for the entire cost of the full-sized sport utility vehicle, using the proceeds from stock he sold in February. Nor was he troubled by the high price of gasoline.
4/28/2000	Start Your Engine! Your Vacuum! Your Spin Cycle!	THE name of this minivan is Windstar Solutions. Clearly, plural problems needed to be solved, and the new Ford concept vehicle, which is on display through Sunday at the New York International Auto Show but is not intended for immediate production, tackles them with a vengeance. And vital problems they are, ones that have threatened America's crucial dominance in the quality-of-gadget wars.
4/25/2000	Blair Meets With Ford Chief to Discuss a Factory's Fate	With Britain's troubled auto industry facing severe cutbacks and job losses, Prime Minister Tony Blair and other government officials have held talks with the Ford Motor Company as it contemplates closing a plant near London. Government officials said today that Mr. Blair met recently with Jacques A. Nasser, the Ford chief executive, and that he and other officials were talking with Ford about an internal review of its European operations expected to be concluded in mid-May.
4/18/2000	Ford Profit Exceeds Forecasts on Strong Sales in the U.S.	Brisk sales of luxury cars and sport utility vehicles in the United States helped lift the Ford Motor Company's first-quarter earnings above forecasts, even though its overseas operations continued to lose money, the company said today. Ford's profit rose 5.1 percent, to $2.08 billion, or $1.70 a diluted share, compared with $1.98 billion, or $1.60 a share, in the period a year earlier. Without a one-time gain a year ago of $165 million from the dissolution of a joint venture in Portugal, Ford's earnings would have risen 15 percent.
4/15/2000	Ford Motor to Pay $10 Billion Dividend and Ensure Family Control	The Ford Motor Company announced a complex revamping of its ownership structure today, including the payment of a $10 billion special dividend -- the largest ever by an American company -- and the issuance of additional stock to the Ford family, cementing its grip on the world's second-largest industrial corporation. The plan is designed to let Ford distribute nearly half its $24 billion cash hoard, one of the largest of any company in the world, while minimizing taxes for its shareholders and giving the Ford family greater financial flexibility, particularly for estate planning. But the big cash disbursement could leave Ford somewhat more vulnerable in a recession, although the company would still have as much cash after the special dividend as General Motors has now.
4/14/2000	FORD PLANNING TO SPIN OFF AUTO PARTS DIVISION	The Ford Motor Company will announce today that it is filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission for spinning off Visteon Automotive Systems, its sprawling auto parts division. Ford plans to distribute 100 percent of Visteon's shares to Ford shareholders in a long-expected deal that is likely to be completed by midsummer. Visteon has $19 billion a year in sales, of which $17 billion are to Ford. Peter J. Pestillo, a vice chairman for Ford, will run Visteon as its chairman and chief executive. Keith Bradsher (NYT)
4/7/2000	Ford to Sell Gasoline-Electric Vehicle in 2003	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it would begin selling a small sport utility vehicle in 2003 using both gasoline and electric propulsion for better gas mileage. General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are working on similar sport utilities. The Ford Escape, which is a little smaller than a Ford Explorer and a little larger than a Honda CR-V, will go on sale this autumn with only gasoline engines available. The optional hybrid engine will be offered on Escapes built three years later at a slightly higher price, Ford said.
4/7/2000	A Ford Vice President Has a European Touch	FORD'S old advertising slogan may need some updating, to wit: Have you driven a Parry-Jones lately? You have if you've been at the wheel of the Ford Focus or the Lincoln LS in North America or the Ford Puma or Ka in Europe. These cars bear the stamp of a single engineer -- Richard Parry-Jones, the Ford Motor Company's group vice president in charge of product development and quality -- as few modern models do. Nowadays, vehicle-development decisions are generally made in committee and executed by teams.
4/4/2000	Robust Sales Push U.S. Auto Industry to Its Best Quarter Ever	Americans bought new cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles at a sizzling pace last month, closing out the best quarter ever for the auto industry as the nation's economy appeared to be following up a winter of brisk economic growth with a springtime of continued strong expansion. Ford Motor said today that its sales in the United States leaped 7.2 percent from a year earlier to the highest level ever for a single month. Four other big automakers had their best March ever: DaimlerChrysler, up 4.4 percent from last year; Toyota, up 16 percent; Honda, up 20.3 percent; and Mitsubishi, up 25.4 percent.
3/26/2000	DaimlerChrysler Nears Deal To Buy 33.4% of Mitsubishi	In another big move toward the global consolidation of the automobile industry, DaimlerChrysler of Germany is to announce a deal tomorrow to acquire 33.4 percent of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors for about $1.3 billion, people close to the companies said yesterday. The deal would make DaimlerChrysler the world's third-largest automaker, behind General Motors and Ford. All three will now have large shares of the three main markets: Western Europe, Japan and the United States. The other giants of the auto industry, Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and the Renault-Nissan alliance, still are weak in at least one of these markets.
3/23/2000	Gentlemen, Merge Your Manufacturers; Consolidation Hits on Virtually All Cylinders	The consolidation of the global auto industry has reached a full-throttle roar as automakers around the world respond to the changing economics of the business. The list of companies partly or entirely acquired by other manufacturers in the last two years was impressive even before the frenzy of the last two weeks: Chrysler, Volvo Cars, Nissan, Saab, Fuji Heavy Industries, Suzuki, Daihatsu, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Since the beginning of last week, General Motors has agreed to buy a fifth of Fiat; Ford Motor has agreed to buy Land Rover from BMW; and DaimlerChrysler has moved close to taking a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Daewoo and Samsung are both up for sale in Korea, with deals likely later this year.
3/22/2000	Rift Deepens Between Britain and Germany Over Rover Deal	An increasingly bitter dispute between Germany and Britain over the BMW sale of the money-losing Rover Group threatened to spill onto the streets after British labor unions called today for a huge demonstration on April 1 to protest the thousands of job losses expected from the deal. The announcement coincided with remarks by a senior German official that Britain's reputation as a haven for foreign investment could be jeopardized by the government's criticism of BMW's keeping secret the talks that led to the sale agreement.
3/21/2000	Carmakers to Alter S.U.V.'s to Reduce Risk to Other Autos	Acknowledging for the first time that sport utility vehicles pose special dangers to other motorists in crashes, automakers say that they are modifying the designs of these vehicles to make them less hazardous. General Motors says it will make the 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada, GMC Envoy and Chevrolet Blazer with steel rails up to 2 inches lower inside their underbodies than in current versions, to reduce the risk of their overriding cars' bumpers and doorsills. Ford Motor plans to do the same for its Explorer, Expedition and Lincoln Navigator over the next two model years.
3/20/2000	Ford Plans Job Cuts At Plant in England	The Ford Motor Company is likely to eliminate more than 1,000 jobs at a giant assembly plant in England and may close the entire factory, in another blow for the British government's industrial policy. Like BMW, which announced on Thursday that it would sell an 8,000-employee Rover factory to a little-known investment firm that plans drastic cutbacks, Ford is alarmed at the strength of the British pound, an auto industry official said. The pound's strength relative to the euro has made it expensive to manufacture in Britain for sale in Europe.
3/17/2000	BMW Will Shed Rover, Selling Sport Utility Vehicle Line to Ford	Six years and nearly $6 billion after buying the Rover Group, BMW of Germany abandoned the British automaker today. BMW essentially gave Rover's money-losing car business to a little-known group of British investors. And it negotiated a deal to sell the Land Rover line of sport utility vehicles to the Ford Motor Company for just under $3 billion.
3/17/2000	Reflection of the Decline of British Cars	For decades now, the British automotive industry has been a story of British ownership dwindling as foreigners snapped up the marques from the proudest Jaguars and Bentleys to the humblest Mini. Today, there were a few extra twists, most remarkably that a British venture capital company might be paid to take over this country's most troubled auto plant. BMW A.G., the German automaker that bought Rover Group for $1.2 billion six years ago and has plowed billions more into it since, moved today to end a disastrous investment that has turned into a sinkhole.
3/12/2000	Ford to Compensate Owners Over V-6 Problem	IN one of the largest and costliest service campaigns ever by an automaker, the Ford Motor Company will provide compensation to owners of 718,000 vehicles with 3.8-liter V-6 engines that have been prone to head-gasket failures. Affected are the 1994-95 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, the '95 Ford Windstar minivan and the '94 Lincoln Continental. Owners are expected to begin receiving notification by the end of this month that if their engines required repairs because of bad head gaskets, they may qualify for compensation or for a certificate worth $4,000 toward the purchase of a new Ford, Lincoln or Mercury.
3/5/2000	From Highways to Runways	After building cars for more than 40 years, Harold A. Poling, the former chairman of Ford, is taking on a new job. Mr. Poling, once an avid pilot, will announce tomorrow that he is becoming chairman of the Eclipse Aviation Corporation, a fledgling company in Scottsdale, Ariz., that will build small jets, primarily for executives. ''When I was involved in business, the use of airplanes was essential,'' Mr. Poling said. ''But I became a little concerned at Ford that we were spending so much on the company jet and not have very many people on it.''
3/2/2000	Auto Sales in February Near Monthly Record	The United States auto industry is poised to have its second-best month for sales ever after the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported higher vehicle sales for February today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate is expected to be about 19 million cars and light trucks when the few remaining companies report sales on Thursday. That would put February sales in second place after September 1986, when the rate was 21.2 million vehicles.
2/29/2000	Ford's campaign for its Focus car will be remade into a hybrid of television and online media.	FORD is overhauling a highly visible element of a big campaign for an important new car line as the company seeks to become part of a hot trend: transforming television advertising into a hybrid of the TV and online media that could be called dot-commercials. Ford and a longtime agency, J. Walter Thompson, plan to introduce next month a series of live commercials for Focus, the new line of ''entry level'' compact cars aimed at younger drivers, with interactivity as a core element. The spots are intended to work with a Web site, www.focus247.com, so that viewers can help determine what their content will be.
2/26/2000	CARMAKERS TO BUY PARTS ON INTERNET	General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler announced today that they would set up the world's biggest online marketplace for the auto industry's private use, a giant auction site like eBay through which they plan to buy the nearly $250 billion worth of parts and other goods they need each year. The site would dwarf all previous commercial activity on the Web. The automakers said they hoped to cut costs and save time by streamlining their purchasing operations and putting them online. The new system would also help them build more cars to customer specifications by allowing them to order parts for assembly plants far more quickly.
2/25/2000	3 Luxury-Car Makers to Leave New Jersey	The Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo car companies are leaving their North American headquarters in New Jersey and heading for California, to be closer to the wealth and trendiness of the West Coast market. The companies announced yesterday that the Ford Motor Company, which owns all three brands, would build a new headquarters for its luxury car division, called the Premiere Automotive Group, in Irvine, an Orange County town about 40 miles south of Los Angeles.
2/24/2000	A Ford Web Venture Will Track Buyers	The Ford Motor Company formed a joint venture today with the closely held Trilogy Software Inc. to develop and operate all of Ford's global customer Web sites to reach more car buyers through the Internet. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Ford will retain a majority stake in the new company, based in Austin, Tex., which the automaker said would eventually employ hundreds of people. Other offices will be here in Dearborn, in Irvine, Calif., and in Europe.
2/19/2000	FORD JOB CUTS	Citing the ''poor and unacceptable'' performance of its European division, the Ford Motor Company said it would cut 1,500 of the 4,300 jobs at its biggest British plant, at Dagenham, east of London. The plant has been running on a four-day week for more than 16 months. Ford produces far more cars in Europe than it can sell in the face of competition from Volkswagen A.G. of Germany and PSA Peugeot Citroen of France. Nick Scheele, left, Ford's European chairman, said the company needed to reduce production by ''at least 200,000 units.'' Last year, Ford's European division produced 2.25 million vehicles and sold 1.7 million, as its West European market share fell from 10 percent to 9.3 percent. Alan Cowell
2/13/2000	Weighing the Value of Corporate Largess	AT a time when the traditional bonds between employees and companies are loosening and a growing share of the economy's work is done by freelance, part-time and temporary workers, the Ford Motor Company took a giant step in the other direction when it announced that it would offer each of its 350,000 employees a computer, printer and unlimited Internet access for $5 a month. Delta Air Lines followed with a similar though less heavily subsidized plan for its 80,000 workers. Beyond Ford's stated goal of increasing computer literacy, the computers-for-everyone policy may have deeper ramifications. Here are three perspectives. JULIE FLAHERTY HARLEY SHAIKEN Professor of social and cultural studies at the University of California, specializing in labor issues. This will link up employees in some new, unexplored ways. The home page is designed by Ford, so the company can get its message out on a host of issues it thinks are important. It has new access to its workers worldwide. Yet it gets into uncharted territory, because the same technology that allows you to buy a Ford Explorer on the Internet also allows you to organize demonstrations in Seattle. Ford workers in Sao Paulo can talk to Ford workers in Cleveland. This brings the possibility of worker interaction in a very far-reaching, electronic way. How this powerful tool will be used is an open question. Ford obviously wants to underscore the connection between the $5-a-month charge for the computer and Henry Ford's doubling of assembly-line wages in 1913 -- to $5 a day. Originally, that money came with a heavy dose of paternalism: Ford judged your moral worth to get that wage. This time around, Ford is saying that is not the intent, and employees will be able to use the computers as they see fit. It would be disastrous public relations to break that promise, so it is likely Ford won't do anything heavy-handed. But that's Ford -- what about the next company? As we move into the Internet age more forcefully, all these kinds of issues will be there, whether it's putting up with advertising or corporate propaganda to get a free computer, or having companies track your every move on the Net. There is going to be a new mix between what is job-related and what relates to one's private life. THOMAS KOCHAN Co-director of the Institute for Work and Employment Research at M.I.T. As long as employees have a voice in how these kinds of benefits are utilized -- and by that I mean a positive but independent voice -- it will serve everyone's interest. If employers approach it in a paternalistic or a self-interested fashion, then it could turn into an intrusion and backfire. I think Ford has got the right institutional setting to make this work. Auto workers know how to take care of their own time and guard their personal and family responsibilities. They traditionally have negotiated for more time off. The kind of positive relationship that Ford and the U.A.W. have will help them find the right balance between the advantages in this opportunity and the intrusion on personal time. The key lesson from research on family benefits is that when employees have a voice in shaping how they are administered day to day, then the benefits are utilized effectively, and it serves everyone well. But when they are announced from the top down, and there isn't a workplace culture that helps employees control the use of these services, there are problems. To employees, it clearly sends a strong message that lifelong learning is important, for all workers and their families. Perhaps a broader cross-section of the work force will be now able to benefit from the new economy and make educational resources available to their children. ROBERT DRAGO Professor of labor studies at Pennsylvania State University and moderator of the Work/Family Newsgroup on the Internet. For most Americans now, access to the Internet allows us to be good citizens, to participate in society and to know what's going on. Children are coming home from school with assignments that can only be completed on the Internet. It's crucial. One worry is that, given modern technology, communications is a more important component of all jobs today. If you can shift that communication from work to home, you've got people working more. That may not be the case here. But I worry that the company will start presuming that all employees have Internet access, and people will be required to be on the Internet to get important information. That's a danger even if it is not the official policy, because supervisors will assume that people have access. That could potentially be a problem.
2/13/2000	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Excursion; Camping With the Incredible Hulk	OR all the cargo capacity of the 2000 Ford Excursion, it enters the market carrying almost more baggage than it can handle. Ford's introduction last year of its uber-utility provoked protests and galvanized a coalition of sport utility haters -- from environmentalists to intimidated drivers of small cars -- for whom the 7,000-pound Excursion was a big, fat bete noire. There, its critics said, behold what lies at the bottom of America's slippery-slope love affair with huge S.U.V.'s.
2/4/2000	Ford Offers Its Workers PC's And Internet for $5 a Month	The Ford Motor Company said today that each of its 350,000 employees worldwide, from factory workers in India to car designers in Michigan, would be offered a high-speed desktop computer, a color printer and unlimited Internet access for just $5 a month. Employees' families will be encouraged to use the equipment, made by the Hewlett-Packard Company, and will be given e-mail accounts. The Ford offer, which executives said was intended to promote computer literacy, includes color monitors, speakers, technical support and ample capacity for workers and their families to create their own Web sites.
2/2/2000	Newest and Trendiest Autos Bring Americans to Dealers	Americans flocked to dealerships last month to buy the most recently introduced and most fashionable cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles available, automakers said today, as every manufacturer except DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced big gains in sales. The three increases of a quarter percentage point each in short-term interest rates last year by the Federal Reserve seemed to have had no effect on the torrid pace in the auto market last month. The Fed is widely expected to respond to inflationary pressures in the economy by raising rates further on Wednesday. But auto executives remained optimistic that the industry this year would nearly match the record-setting pace of 1999.
1/27/2000	Ford Posts Higher Earnings, But Shares Still Take a Hit	A broad improvement in auto and financial operations allowed the Ford Motor Company to post slightly better earnings for the fourth quarter than financial analysts had expected, but the automaker's shares fell on fears that further profit gains might prove elusive. Ford's profits surged in North America, despite a one-time, $103 million charge related to last autumn's labor contract with the United Automobile Workers, while the company's losses narrowed in Europe and South America. Ford Credit, the division for car loans and leases, posted a 32 percent gain in profits after several years of flat earnings. Among Ford's biggest units, only its auto parts division, Visteon, posted slightly worse results than a year earlier.
1/27/2000	FORD TO GAIN CONTROL	The world's second-largest automaker, the Ford Motor Company, has agreed to acquire a controlling interest in its South African subsidiary, the South African Motor Corporation, by purchasing the stake of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Ltd., which had been the automaker's other major shareholder. Ford, which has a 45 percent stake in Samcor, will acquire Anglo's 45 percent interest over a period of time -- 35 percent immediately and the remaining 10 percent over the next two years. Henri E. Cauvin
1/23/2000	It's Over for the Ovals; Now, Ford Plays It Safe	NOW better to assess the prospects for the 2000 Ford Taurus than to consult those who have to sell it? A month or so before the new model reached dealerships late last year, I took an early-production test car to the local Ford store to gauge reactions. One might have expected the staff to be unimpressed with the Taurus's makeover; after all, auto sales representatives are not usually described as car enthusiasts. But I was surprised; they were interested and impressed. They enthusiastically noted the new grille, the trunk and the rear window. They commented on how the highlights of the hood complemented the edgy new Ford design theme so noticeable on the Mercury Cougar and Ford Focus. They were especially pleased to note that the previous Taurus's oval rear window and awkward taillights were gone. And they did not notice that the doors and windshield were unchanged, saving a lot on production costs. The designers had done their job well.
1/20/2000	Failing Korean Automakers Become Worldwide Quarry	Two South Korean automakers spent the 1990's building costly factories, running them inefficiently and wrecking their balance sheets with enormous debts -- and have now emerged as sought-after acquisition targets in the latest round of consolidation in the global auto industry. At industry conferences here over the last two weeks, American and European executives have repeatedly cited the Daewoo Motor Company and Samsung Motor Inc., both of which are insolvent, as desirable purchases at the right price.
1/1/2000	Detroit Plays Catch-Up In Race for Hybrid Car; With Fewer Subsidies, Japan Is Ahead	With hundreds of millions of dollars of private and federal research work behind it, the General Motors Precept, an experimental model to be introduced here on Jan. 9, is probably the most expensive single car ever built. Yet it is still a lot of car for the money. In place of side-view mirrors, which cause a lot of wind resistance, it has tiny cameras, mounted on the front doors, that send images to the dashboard. Rather than the smooth, rounded contours commonly associated with aerodynamic design, carefully angled body panels are designed to give the six-passenger Precept far less wind resistance than a Corvette sports car. And instead of a gasoline engine, the car has two electric motors, batteries under the seats and a rear diesel engine to charge the batteries and provide additional power and range.
1/1/2000	Looking Back, With an Eye to the Future	The enormous growth and subsequent unionization of the auto industry created opportunities for millions of Americans to enter the middle class. Alfred Bardelli, whose family immigrated from Italy to a Pennsylvania coal town 10 months after his birth in 1909, began cutting glass for windows in 1928 at Ford Motor's Rouge complex in Dearborn, near Detroit. It was the world's largest factory then, with 103,000 workers. He joined the United Automobile Workers in 1937, a time of violent clashes between union organizers and company security personnel. He is the sole surviving member of the negotiating team that concluded the U.A.W.'s first contract with Ford in 1941.
12/31/1999	Oops! Recalling a Year Of Automotive Recalls	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced 120 safety defect recalls this year; two dozen involved more than 100,000 vehicles each, and about 12 involved fewer than 1,000 vehicles; biggest recall notices went to owners of 2.7 million 1986-95 Ford Tauruses, Mercury Sables and Lincoln Continentals in 25 states and Washington, DC, involving possible subframe damage from exposure to road salt; chart with top 10 defect notices of year; photos (M)
12/24/1999	This Just In: Model T Gets Award	SO maybe you were expecting the Chevy Vega? Had you put all your eggs on the Humber Super Snipe? If anticipation of the selection of Car of the Century was keeping you up nights, you'll be relieved to know that the votes are in: Ford's Model T is the most significant car of the automotive age. Whew!
12/23/1999	G.M. and Ford Expected to Compete for Daewoo Motor	The Daewoo Motor Company became the object of a potential bidding brawl between the world's two largest automakers today after the South Korean government decided to solicit offers instead of negotiate with a single buyer. The government, which is overseeing Daewoo Motor's sale as part of a broader dismantling of the Daewoo Group, the insolvent conglomerate, decided to auction the automaker after the Ford Motor Company expressed interest in buying it. Earlier, the government had indicated it might bargain exclusively with the General Motors Corporation, which said last week that it wanted to buy Daewoo Motor.
12/14/1999	G.M. Opel Unit Says It's Likely to Pay Nazi-Era Slaves  	The German subsidiary of General Motors said today that it would probably contribute to a fund to compensate forced laborers in the Nazi era, a move that could make G.M. the first American company to accept responsibility for those abuses. The subsidiary, Opel, made its statement as lawyers for the former workers appeared close to a final multibillion-dollar accord with the German government and industry. An accord would safeguard the companies from legal claims.
12/3/1999	Cars Overtake Light Trucks In November Sales Figures	A surprising jump in car sales allowed Ford Motor to post an unexpectedly strong November, as the industry's sales of cars increased faster than those of high-profit sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans for the first time in nearly three years. Excluding Volvo Cars, which Ford bought last March, Ford's sales rose 4.9 percent last month from a year earlier. That allowed Ford to almost keep pace with the industry, which grew 7.1 percent, as Asian and European automakers prospered while General Motors's sales were flat and DaimlerChrysler's sales edged down.
11/16/1999	Priceline.com to Test Ford Web Link	Priceline.com Inc. said today that it would test a service in Florida that lets consumers name their price for a new car or truck when they visit the Ford Motor Company's Internet site. Starting on Tuesday, Florida residents who visit www.ford.com can name a price for a vehicle from Ford, the world's No. 2 automaker, through a link with Priceline.com. Priceline.com will present the offer to local Ford dealerships, and the first to accept wins the sale.
11/12/1999	Rubin Is Named to Ford's Board	The Ford Motor Company appointed Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, to its board as the automaker tries to improve its credibility with investors. Mr. Rubin will join the board of Ford on Jan. 1. Two weeks ago, he joined Citigroup Inc., the financial-services company, as chairman of its executive committee.
11/11/1999	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Ford Is Getting Its Ducks in a Row for Divestiture of Its Parts Unit	Ford Motor recently overcame its most contentious union negotiations in decades by finessing an agreement over the future of workers at its giant auto parts unit. Now, that pact is about to be put to the test. Ford is on the verge of formally announcing the divestiture of the unit, Visteon Automotive Systems, and on Friday it plans to name Ford's longtime labor chief, Peter J. Pestillo, as the new company's chairman and chief executive, according to a Ford executive.
11/3/1999	Foreign Nameplate Autos Are Sales Favorites in U.S.	Buyers snapped up cars and trucks with foreign nameplates last month, forsaking some of their past favorites -- American-made sport utility vehicles. Nearly every foreign brand reporting sales results today showed increases, and many notched double-digit gains. Toyota sales rose 12.6 percent in October compared to the same period a year ago. Honda sales rose 3.2 percent and Nissan jumped 27.6 percent.
10/31/1999	BEHIND THE WHEEL /2000 Ford Focus; The Econobox Turns a Corner and Picks Up Some Edge	JUDGING by the models arriving in dealer showrooms this fall, one might think that small-car sales are booming and profits from economy models are soaring. But the opposite is true. The small-car market has been in a slump for nearly three years as cheap gasoline and stable vehicle prices have drawn buyers to larger vehicles, including sport utilities. Profits from small cars are negligible to nonexistent.
10/30/1999	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Cracks in Canada's Glass Ceiling; Women Get Some Top Posts, but Few Boardroom Keys	In the early 1990's, Barbara G. Stymiest, a partner at the accounting firm Ernst & Young here, was irritated to discover that her Toronto golf club reserved Saturday morning tee times for men, on the assumption that wives could play all week long. But that golf rule has long ago been changed, and Ms. Stymiest has just become president of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
10/28/1999	A Horn of Plenty For Opera in Detroit; How to Thrive in a Blue-Collar City	As an opera lover who sees several performances a month in Vienna and other European capitals, Astrid Eywo is used to occasionally sitting elbow to elbow with American tourists. But on Oct. 29 she will be the tourist, having flown here from Vienna for the opening of the Michigan Opera Theater's production of Jules Massenet's ''Werther.'' Mrs. Eywo is making the trip because she learned on the Internet that Andrea Bocelli, the blind tenor, would be making his North American opera stage debut in the title role here, with the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves. ''You have so many big artists in Detroit,'' Mrs. Eywo said. ''I am so looking forward to it.''
10/28/1999	Wheels for 2000: The Details Count	''More George Jetson than Georg Jensen'' is the way Marc Newson, the Australian designer, describes his new concept car for Ford. Introduced at the Tokyo Auto Show last week, the 021C is what Mr. Newson calls retro-futurist, a sort of 60's vision of what the year 2000 looks like. J. Mays, Ford's vice president in charge of design, wanted a product designer to take a fresh look at his industry. He had been intrigued by Mr. Newson's work ever since he saw his Lockheed lounge chair in a Madonna video. Auto makers are getting ready for the huge number of teen-agers expected to buy their first cars in the next decade. The 021C is a basic car, built on an existing chassis, and Mr. Mays said, ''It is capable of being produced tomorrow.'' Evoking small cars of the early 60's, Mr. Newson's car is a composite of round-cornered rectangles, shapes found in his Dish Doctor dish rack for Magis, his furniture for Cappellini and his lamps for Flos.
10/27/1999	Ford Goes Global in Effort to Control the Clock	TURN on a TV set almost anywhere around the world at about 9 P.M. local time on Monday, and chances are a Ford commercial will be on. The reason? Ford Motor, in an unusual stunt, is buying an estimated $10 million of commercial time on dozens of national and pan-regional TV networks -- 40 broadcast and cable channels in America alone -- to run a single, two-minute spot.
10/26/1999	Ford to Install Safety Bars in Big Pickups	The Ford Motor Company plans to start installing hollow, energy-absorbing steel bars below the front and rear bumpers of all its industrial-size pickup trucks in the 2001 model year to reduce the risk that they will ride over cars in crashes, Ford officials said in interviews today at a safety conference here. Ford is also studying the feasibility of adding such bars to four-wheel-drive versions of the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator full-size sport utility vehicles and the F-150 pickup truck, said Priya Prasad, Ford's top safety researcher.
10/24/1999	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Fiat Multipla and Ford Ka; Making the Scene, Avant-Garde Europeans Hit New York's Streets	AZ SNIDER was making his way through the afternoon crush of pedestrians in Rockefeller Center when the sight of a green, four-wheeled, six-passenger frog stopped him cold. ''Man, that is one ugly car,'' Mr. Snider, of Manhattan, volunteered even before he could be asked his opinion of the Fiat Multipla parked near the ''Today'' show studio. Just short of dumbfounded, he seemed unable to take his eyes off the oddly shaped mini-minivan, which has sold briskly in Europe in the year since it went on sale. After sitting at the wheel, though, and poking around in the spacious cabin, Mr. Snyder assessed the car more charitably, conceding that the unusual design incorporated a number of tricks that made the Multipla practical and pleasant. He even mellowed a bit toward the styling.
10/20/1999	Ford Finds That Remaking a Fixture Is Risky Business	WEARING a dark blue Bill Blass shirt with the Ford Motor Company scripted over his heart, Rick Crossland, the brand manager for the 2000 Taurus, bounded onstage at the Boar's Head Inn here one day last month to deliver a sales presentation. The target customers for the new Taurus, Mr. Crossland announced in a buoyant voice, would be the very people who already owned Tauruses, some four million in number. Ford was not chasing new buyers, in other words. It just wanted to keep the old ones. What a difference four years makes. I remember Ford executives explaining to me, as I began reporting for a book on the development of the 1996 Taurus, their daring strategy. Banking on the loyalty of current owners, they would concentrate their resources on attracting the younger, more affluent, better-educated people who normally bought imports.
10/20/1999	Want the Secret to Selling Cars? First, Be Bob Tasca	CLICK-THUD. Click-thud. Click-thud. Over and over, Bob Tasca Sr. unlatched the door of the car and pushed it closed, listening for creaks and feeling for resistance. ''See that? It practically closes itself,'' he said with approval. He walked to the front of another car, stooped down and eyed its length as if lining up a target in a shotgun sight. ''This door is coming up a little bit,'' he said, annoyed. ''They won't spend the money to bend the glass.''
10/20/1999	At Rallies in Europe, Africa and Asia, Pocket Rockets Rule	TO most Americans, motor sports mean big, V8-powered mutants thundering along Nascar ovals or sleek, needle-nosed Indy cars or Ferraris and Porsches streaking along impeccably smooth concrete and blacktop tracks. But the world's most popular form of auto racing, rallying, is populated by names synonymous with economical transportation: Subaru, Mitsubishi and even that Czech-built anomaly, Skoda. They are the ultimate pocket rockets, high-powered, lightweight coupes and sedans built for the World Rally Championship series, an event that takes place in 10 countries on real roads replete with bumps and potholes and, sometimes, on terrain barely suited for hiking.
10/19/1999	U.S. Sales Help Ford Deliver 11% Profit Gain in Quarter	Strong sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and large cars in the United States gave the Ford Motor Company better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter, even as the company acknowledged severe problems in its European operations. Ford said today that it had earned $1.11 billion, or 90 cents a share, up 11 percent from the third quarter last year, when it earned $1 billion, or 80 cents a share. It beat analysts' profit expectations of 85 cents a share.
10/18/1999	Ford Creates Regional Jobs And Shuffles Its Executives	After five years of experimenting with a complex management structure that gave managers global responsibility for certain functions, like worldwide small car development, the Ford Motor Company plans to return on Jan. 1 to a more traditional organization in which many executives will have regional responsibilities. Fourteen senior executives at Ford will change job titles then, the auto maker announced on Friday. The management shuffle was driven partly by concern about Ford's poor performance in Europe and South America and partly by the company's desire to grant more autonomy to overseas managers to groom them for top jobs later.
10/15/1999	Ghosts of Detroit's Past In Ford's Old Buildings	HENRY FORD was so intent on preserving pieces of the nation's past that he had dozens of buildings shipped here to Greenfield Village, a historical park where visitors can wander through Thomas Edison's laboratory and the Wright Brothers' bicycle shop. Yet as Ford's greatest legacy, the Ford Motor Company, looks to its centennial in 2003, several of the most important buildings from its past have disappeared or are in disrepair. The company's original Mack Avenue plant in Detroit was destroyed by fire decades ago, though it has been recreated in Greenfield Village. The company's former headquarters at 3000 Schaefer Road in Dearborn, which was later the home of Lincoln-Mercury and then the Ford parts and service division, was leveled in 1998.
10/15/1999	CANADIAN AUTO PACT THREATENED	The World Trade Organization has ruled in an interim decision that a Canadian law permitting the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler to import vehicles into Canada without paying duty violates fair trade practices. Japan and the European Union had challenged the 1956 law because Canada imposes a 6.5 percent import duty on other car makers. The final ruling is due on Nov. 25, but it can be appealed. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
10/15/1999	QUARTERLY DIVIDEND IS RAISED TO 50 CENTS A SHARE	The Ford Motor Company raised its quarterly dividend 8.7 percent, responding to investor pressure that some of its $24 billion in cash go to shareholders. The dividend increase, to 50 cents from 46 cents, was Ford's first since October 1998 and its eighth since the second quarter of 1994. It applies to class B and common shares. Ford shares rose 31.25 cents, to $53.0625. They have fallen 9.6 percent this year, even with record United States car and truck sales. The fourth-quarter dividends are payable on Dec. 1 to shareholders of record on Nov. 1.
10/11/1999	Ford's Deal With Auto Workers Has an Unusual Twist	In difficult labor talks with the Ford Motor Company, the United Automobile Workers union finally agreed to an unusual compromise: it would allow the company to spin off its giant auto parts unit as long as Ford did not spin off workers with it, people briefed on the deal said today. After nearly 30 consecutive hours of negotiations, the union and the company reached a tentative agreement Saturday afternoon on a four-year contract for Ford's 101,000 unionized workers, averting a potential strike. Under the deal, workers, who are expected to ratify the agreement later this month, would receive annual raises of 3 percent on top of adjustments for inflation, plus a signing bonus of $1,350.
10/10/1999	Ford and Auto Workers Avert Strike With Tentative Agreement	After round-the-clock negotiations lasting nearly 30 hours, the United Automobile Workers union reached a tentative agreement today with the Ford Motor Company on a new contract for its 101,000 unionized workers. ''The U.A.W. has reached a tentative agreement with Ford on a new contract covering hourly workers at Ford facilities in the United States,'' the union and the company announced in a joint statement at 1:30 this afternoon. Both the union and the company refused to discuss any details of the contract until they had a chance to discuss the contract with the workers.
10/5/1999	Ford Motor Posts Record Sales For Model Year Just Ended	The Ford Motor Company said today that it had shattered a 21-year-old sales record in the 1999 model year. But the company still lost market share to foreign auto makers. Ford said that sales for its model year rose 4.9 percent, to 4,117,792; the previous record for the company had been the 1978 model year, when it sold 4,084,684.
10/1/1999	Ford Planning To Spin Off Parts Division	The Ford Motor Company plans to spin off its giant auto parts division directly to shareholders and give wage and job guarantees to the division's factory workers in a contract under negotiation with the United Automobile Workers union, people close to the matter said. The future of the parts division has been a major problem for Ford as it tries to hammer out a new labor contract. The company had considered selling the unit, called Visteon Automotive Systems, to either the Lear Corporation or to Delphi Automotive Systems Inc., which was itself spun off in May from the General Motors Corporation, the people said.
9/22/1999	Ford in Pact With Canada's Auto Workers	The Ford Motor Company reached a tentative, three-year contract this evening with the union representing its Canadian workers, three hours before a threatened strike at midnight. The agreement was similar to the generous deal that DaimlerChrysler A.G. negotiated with the United Automobile Workers union last Thursday, although that contract is for four years.
9/21/1999	Ford Executive Will Retire at End of Year	Ross Roberts, the Ford Motor Company executive who has tried to streamline the company's dealer network, will retire at the end of the year. Mr. Roberts, 61, left his mark on the company, the world's second-largest auto maker, with the creation of Auto Collection stores in San Diego; Tulsa, Okla.; Oklahoma City, and Salt Lake City. Ford bought out some dealers and offered others in those cities part-ownership in a consolidated group of showrooms, where it encouraged one-price, no-haggle sales.
9/21/1999	Possible Rift For Detroit In Labor Pact	DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s tentative contract with the United Automobile Workers contains company concessions that may create problems when the union demands similar concessions next from General Motors and Ford. DaimlerChrysler agreed in the contract to hire more employees if the work force at any factory complex falls by more than 5 percent during the four-year contract for any reason except a downturn in automobile sales.
9/21/1999	A Web-Researched Ford in Microsoft's Future	A joint venture of the Microsoft Corporation with the Ford Motor Company, offering built-to-order automobiles via the World Wide Web, shows the potentially wrenching changes that electronic commerce is bringing in its wake. At a news conference here today, Microsoft and Ford executives took pains to argue that their venture -- allowing on-line customers to configure their own cars and obtain detailed information on product availability -- would not displace the traditional role of the car dealer.
9/20/1999	Microsoft On-Line Alliance With Ford Expected Today	The Microsoft Corporation's plans for the Internet have shifted uncertainly in recent years, but a series of announcements expected this week is intended to emphasize its new, narrower focus as a supplier of software for the World Wide Web and electronic commerce services. Microsoft intends today to announce an alliance between MSN Carpoint, its on-line car-shopping service, and the Ford Motor Company, according to consultants who have been told of the agreement.
9/18/1999	Ford Facing Unrest in U.S. And Canada	After enjoying the best labor relations in the auto industry for a generation, the Ford Motor Company is likely to face a strike next week in Canada and heavy pressure in the United States from the United Automobile Workers union. Auto labor leaders on both sides of the border have been emboldened by the rich contract that the U.A.W. tentatively reached on Thursday with DaimlerChrysler A.G. The four-year contract revived a practice from the union's glory days of the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's by calling for annual wage increases of 3 percent in addition to cost-of-living adjustments that almost match the rate of inflation.
9/17/1999	DaimlerChrysler And Auto Union In Tentative Deal; One U.A.W. Local Official Calls Deal 'a Great Package'	Paving the way for contracts covering the nation's 400,000 unionized auto workers, the United Automobile Workers union and DaimlerChrysler A.G. this morning reached tentative agreement on a four-year pact calling for a $1,350 signing bonus and pay increases of 3 percent a year on top of adjustments for inflation. If workers ratify the deal later this month, as expected, they will also get heftier pension benefits and additional job security, even as the company is allowed to continue downsizing through attrition, according to local union officials. Under the current contract, auto workers have earned between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, depending on the amount of overtime they work and the level of corporate profits.
9/16/1999	Auto Industry's Contract Talks Continue	Negotiators for the United Automobile Workers and DaimlerChrysler A.G. continued their round-the-clock labor talks today after indefinitely extending their current contract, which was to expire at midnight on Tuesday. Three-year contracts with General Motors and Ford Motor were also scheduled to expire at midnight on Tuesday, and talks continued with those companies, too. The union was expected to reach an agreement with DaimlerChrysler first. In a sign that talks were progressing, the union stopped five wildcat strikes that broke out on Tuesday.
9/15/1999	Auto Makers Granted Extensions As Labor Negotiations Continue	As labor talks covering the nation's 400,000 auto workers continued past the midnight expiration of current labor contracts, the United Automobile Workers union granted contract extensions that allowed auto factories to keep humming without interrupting this year's record auto sales. Late Tuesday, the union extended the Ford Motor Company contract for an indefinite time. Then it extended its contract with the General Motors Corporation. Finally, minutes before midnight, the union granted an extension to the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, the company closest to reaching an agreement with the union. That wasn't soon enough to stop wildcat strikes at DaimlerChrysler, which came as the union continued to put pressure on the company in the hours before the midnight deadline. In St. Louis, 2,800 workers building highly profitable Dodge Ram pickups walked off the job around 8:45 P.M., along with 4,400 workers building the company's bread-and-butter minivans, according to David Barnas, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman. An hour later in Kokomo, Ind., about 8,400 workers building transmissions and auto parts, walked off the job. Components built in those factories are used by some of the company's biggest money makers, its four-wheel drive sport utility vehicles. It is unclear whether the morning shift will report to work at those factories. A deal is expected first at DaimlerChrysler and is likely to call for raises of at least 3 percent annually for the next three or four years, for increased pension benefits and for strengthened job security measures for workers, according to labor and industry executives. Union and company officials have refused to disclose details of the talks. The union typically reaches a deal with one of the companies then insists the other two accept similar terms.
9/15/1999	It's a Hybrid In Sport Utility Clothes; A Car-Based Light Truck, It Obeys the Fuel Rules, and It Helps Make Money	Scheduled to go on sale next spring, the Chrysler PT Cruiser is not quite a sport utility vehicle and not really a minivan. It does not look like a conventional car, either, although it uses much the same underbody and even a few of the same parts as the Dodge Neon, which is definitely a car.
9/12/1999	From Defending Big Tobacco to Fighting Ford Motor for a Lone Client	When C. Mark Pickrell was an associate at a big New York law firm three years ago, helping to defend a large cigarette company against anti-smoking lawsuits filed by Mississippi and New Jersey, a colleague nicknamed him Brimstone, joking that he would surely go to hell for having represented Big Tobacco. Now Mr. Pickrell is in another courtroom struggle, fighting a big corporation, not defending one.
9/11/1999	Auto Workers Try to Wring DaimlerChrysler Concessions	Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, is demanding that DaimlerChrysler A.G. make it easier for the union to organize workers at its plants as a condition of leading industry contract talks, U.A.W. officials said. Mr. Yokich spent the last two days pressing DaimlerChrysler to go beyond a simple promise to remain neutral in U.A.W. campaigns, the officials said. The union is seeking access to employee lists and to factory floors, pledges that plants will not be shut down if the union wins and simpler election procedures.
9/10/1999	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Collecting; The '49 Car That Saved Ford Motor	THE Ford Motor Company has been on a roll -- toting up record sales and profits, assembling a stable of foreign subsidiaries including Volvo and Jaguar, taking a lead in cutting pollution from light trucks, forging into uncharted waters with a strategy to offer an array of consumer services of which cars will be just a part. Only students of history or those with long memories will recall how this dynamic company has sometimes teetered on the precipice -- most notably just after World War II. Indeed, Ford was in a financial free-fall in the late 1940's as its founder, Henry Ford, was growing senile and incapable of wielding a firm hand over a company bedeviled by strikes, material shortages and archaic manufacturing processes. Ultimately, the company was saved by Henry's young grandson, Henry 2d, and a group of ''whiz kid'' executives recruited from the Air Force. And it was saved, too, by a car, which turned 50 years old this year.
9/9/1999	Auto Workers Choose Ford For Canada Contract Talks	The Ford Motor Company will be the pattern-setting company in labor negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, the union announced today. ''We will get a good settlement,'' Basil E. (Buzz) Hargrove, the president of the Canadian union, said. ''It is time working people in our nation got a pay raise.''
9/9/1999	Ford Will Sponsor A Singer's Tour	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would expand efforts to interest younger consumers in its new Focus line, made by the Ford division, by becoming a sponsor of the fall concert tour of the singer Ricky Martin. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Ford joins a roster of sponsors for the popular entertainer's upcoming tour that includes Pepsi-Cola. The agreement includes possible appearances by Mr. Martin in up to three live television commercials for Focus, one of which will be produced in Spanish as well as English. The spots, scheduled to begin tonight during the 1999 MTV Music Video Awards, are being created by the J. Walter Thompson Detroit unit of WPP Group P.L.C.
9/8/1999	U.S. and Ford Settle Harassment Case	The Ford Motor Company reached a settlement today with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, agreeing to pay nearly $8 million in damages to women who complained of racial and sexual harassment at two Ford factories. The settlement is the largest the commission has reached with an auto maker based in the United States and the fourth largest in the commission's history. It also calls for 30 percent of the supervisory positions at the plants, which are in Chicago and Chicago Heights, to be held by women within the next three years.
9/5/1999	Car Guys Who Really Like Cars	At the Laguna Seca race track near Monterey, Calif., Detroit's auto executives, who were on the left coast a few days ago for meetings and mingling, took a turn at being car guys. Jacques A. Nasser, chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, zoomed around the track in a 1939 Aston Martin. ''They go fast and stop slow,'' he said with a wide, relaxed smile. G. Richard Wagoner Jr., chief operating officer of General Motors, strolled along with John F. Smith, general manager of the company's Cadillac division, and tried to talk despite the regular, deafening roar from the track.
9/3/1999	Ford Reports Surprisingly Strong Sales For August	The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales in August were even higher than expected, making last month the best August ever for auto sales in the United States and the best month in the 1990's after adjusting for seasonal variations in demand. Ford posted an 8.1 percent increase in sales compared with the period a year earlier. Car sales leaped 19.2 percent, with the introduction of new models and the purchase of Volvo's car business. Sales of light trucks -- sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans -- climbed seven-tenths of a percent.
8/26/1999	Ford Gains in Ruling on Web Site Dispute	The Ford Motor Company has persuaded a Federal judge to help it in a legal bid to quash a Web site that it contends solicits trade secrets from Ford employees. Judge Nancy Edmunds of the Federal District Court in Detroit issued a temporary restraining order today forbidding Robert Lane, the operator of the Web site, Blue Oval News (www.blueovalnews.com), from destroying Ford documents.
8/25/1999	Ford's Labor Relations Are on Edge as G.M.'s Relax	After 13 years without a strike, the Ford Motor Company is facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor relations at the General Motors Corporation are finally starting to improve after 19 strikes over the last five years, union officials and auto executives say. The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry, they said. The U.A.W. conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and 1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that helped it and hurt G.M. and the Chrysler Corporation, which has since become part of DaimlerChrysler A.G.
8/23/1999	Ford is starting a big campaign to establish a common image for its sport utility vehicles.	TRYING to establish a common brand image for its ever-growing family of sport utility vehicles, the Ford Motor Company is preparing to start next month one of the largest advertising campaigns ever in the auto industry. After relying for nearly two decades on its ''built Ford tough'' theme for pickups, it has created a separate slogan, ''no boundaries,'' for its sport utility models and will start advertising them as a group, as well as individually. Because it will also be putting three new sport utilities on the market the next six months, Ford and its dealers are planning to spend huge sums on television, print and Internet ads.
8/22/1999	Spirit Lives On After 35 Years	IF you were born in 1964, you've probably begun to notice signs of aging: fallen arches, a bald spot, a tummy that no longer tucks. Isn't it inspiring to find a 35-year-old that still looks and feels young? With its 1964 1/2 Mustang, christened at the last World's Fair held in New York, Ford invented the so-called ''pony car'' -- sporty personal transportation at a reasonable price. Although the market is quite different these days -- people who once had Mustangs, Camaros and Barracudas are more likely to drive sport sedans or sport utilities -- the formula still works. Seven million Mustangs have been sold since '64; sales were up 25 percent this year, through July.
8/22/1999	Saddling Mustangs For a Birthday Ride	MY first Mustang, a used 1968 hardtop with a 289 V8, came with the basic Mustang handling upgrade: two sandbags in the trunk. For better grip in snow -- as well as a car that didn't try to change direction each time it hit a bump in hard cornering -- a little ballast helped. Now, 35 years after the Mustang's introduction, it is time to dump the sand for something more sophisticated: an independent rear suspension. Alas, this is available only on the 8,095 SVT Mustang Cobras built this year, at a $4,000 premium over similarly equipped GT's. Other Mustangs, including the GT, keep the old live axle.
8/20/1999	For Bikers With Baggage	A song mocking the material trappings of success like luxury cars has been invoked for a second time by a campaign for, yes, luxury cars. In 1995 and 1996, Mercedes-Benz of North America, now part of DaimlerChrysler A.G., ran a TV commercial featuring ''Mercedes-Benz,'' the song co-written and sung by Janis Joplin that begins with the lyric ''Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz.'' The spot, by Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, drew notice because the song had satirized the craving for symbols of materialism.
8/20/1999	Joplin's Song In Use Again	Pickup trucks are popular and auto makers cannot build sport utility vehicles fast enough, so three auto makers have separately come to the same conclusion: it is time to start building sport utility pickups. At an annual convention here to show dealers the offerings for the new model year, the Ford Motor Company introduced the Explorer Sport Trac, to go on sale in January. Like similar vehicles planned for next year by the General Motors Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company, the Sport Trac has the passenger compartment of a four-door sport utility vehicle but also has a short, open truck bed in back.
8/18/1999	Hoping for Repeat Success, Auto Makers Build a Hybrid	SEEKING to cast a spell on skeptical younger car buyers, the Ford Motor Company will center one of its largest recent product introductions on a ploy that could be called the Blaring Gurwitch Project. That's Annabelle Gurwitch, a co-host of ''Dinner and a Movie,'' a popular series on the TBS Superstation cable television channel. The perky 30-something Ms. Gurwitch will be featured in more than 60 live TV commercials on four networks, which will begin Sept. 9, to pitch the 2000 Ford Focus, intended to be the mainstay of the small-car offerings by the Ford division.
8/13/1999	Ford Motor hopes young consumers will be hooked by a campaign featuring live commercials.	The unexpected death of a labor leader over the weekend makes it likely that the Ford Motor Company will be the lead company in labor negotiations covering the auto industry's 405,000 blue-collar workers. Jack Laskowski, a vice president of the United Automobile Workers union, died on Sunday, apparently of a heart attack, the union said today. Mr. Laskowski, 59, led the labor team negotiating with DaimlerChrysler A. G.
8/10/1999	U.A.W. Official's Death Puts Labor-Contract Focus on Ford	Seeking to reassure its members that it is taking a hard line in labor talks, the United Automobile Workers union plans to hold strike authorization votes at all Ford Motor Company factories on Aug. 17, in preparation for the expiration on Sept. 14 of national contracts with all auto makers here. The union holds such votes every three years at all the auto factories it represents, just in case union leaders need to call a national strike if negotiators fail to conclude new national contracts. A strike this year seems unlikely, most labor and auto officials here say.
8/4/1999	U.A.W. to Seek Strike Vote Aug. 17 at All Ford Plants	Auto makers dangled rebates in front of their customers last month, and like fish to bait, buyers snapped up new cars and trucks. That led to a brisk annual sales pace of 17 million vehicles and kept the industry on track for a record-setting sales year. The General Motors Corporation, which was virtually shut down by a strike in June and July last year, saw its sales jump 62.6 percent in July compared with figures in the bleak period a year earlier. Car sales jumped 68.2 percent, while sales of minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose 57.2 percent. Part of the sales increase was a result of generous rebates and discounted financing deals that G.M. began offering on July 15 on nearly every 1999 model. The deals are good through September.
8/4/1999	Strong July and Rebates Position Auto Makers for Record Year	The Canadian Auto Workers union is applying extra muscle at contract-bargaining time to pressure the Big Three auto makers into helping the union organize employees at Magna International Inc., one of the world's largest automotive parts suppliers. Basil E. (Buzz) Hargrove, the Canadian auto union president, put Magna on the agenda last week in the opening contract talks with DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc., General Motors of Canada Ltd. and the Ford Motor Company of Canada. The auto makers and the union are seeking a new contract before the current one expires on Sept. 21.
7/30/1999	Auto Union In New Push In Canada	The Ford Motor Company, the world's No. 2 auto maker, said yesterday that it would try to increase tire sales at its United States dealerships sixfold, to six million in 2001. Ford said that it would start a national advertising campaign next week and that it planned to add training programs for dealership staff and centralized tire purchasing to drive down costs. The auto maker wants to capture 12 percent of the $100 billion spent annually on replacement parts in the United States, up from 6 percent, by making tires and other parts cheaper and easier to buy. The move is part of Ford's push to keep customers after they buy a car or truck.
7/30/1999	FORD SETS GOAL OF SELLING SIX TIMES MORE TIRES BY 2001	About 1,500 workers at the Ford Motor Company's truck factory outside Sao Paulo pressed forward their strike for a fifth day. The employees, who are protesting Ford's plan to close the factory and transfer production to another site, also occupied an area in front of Government offices in downtown Sao Paulo. Unions are calling on Government officials to protect jobs in southern Brazil at a time Ford is planning to build a car factory in the country's poor northeastern region with Government incentives. Simon Romero
7/23/1999	Ford Workers in Brazil Strike Over Shift of Plant	In a move that increased tension over the Ford Motor Company's plan to build a $1.3 billion car factory in Brazil's poor northeast, far from the industrial south where most of this country's auto industry is concentrated, 1,500 workers at the company's truck plant here went on strike today, fearing that their jobs are threatened. Employees at the plant in Ipiranga, a gritty industrial suburb, halted production of pickups and larger trucks. The strike is the latest negative development to tarnish Ford's image in Brazil since the company clashed with Socialist officials in a dispute over tax breaks in a southern state earlier this year.
7/21/1999	FORD GETS REDUCED INCENTIVES	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil released a decree providing the Ford Motor Company with tax breaks and Government financing for its plan to build a $1.3 billion factory in Brazil's underdeveloped northeast. But in an effort to appease industrial groups in the country's south, Mr. Cardoso removed some of the decree's original terms that would have given Ford more generous incentives. Simon Romero
7/19/1999	Ford Motor Shifts Work to WPP Unit	The Ford Motor Company has consolidated the Ford brand's South American account with J. Walter Thompson, part of WPP Group P.L.C., by awarding duties in Brazil to J. Walter Thompson Publicidade Ltda. in Sao Paulo. Billings were not disclosed. The account had been handled for four years by Young & Rubicam Brazil in Sao Paulo, part of the Young & Rubicam Advertising Latin America unit of Young & Rubicam Inc.
7/16/1999	LEAR STOCK RISES ON REPORTS OF MERGER TALKS WITH FORD	The stock of the Lear Corporation, the biggest maker of car seats and interiors, rose yesterday on renewed talk that the company was discussing a combination with the Ford Motor Company's Visteon parts unit. The two companies are said to have not decided how to combine the businesses. A full combination of Visteon, with annual sales of $18.2 billion, and Lear, with sales of about $12.1 billion, would rival the Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation, a former unit of the General Motors Corporation, as the world's largest auto parts maker. Lear's shares were up $1.75 each, to $50.375, and Ford was up 56.25 cents at $53.50.
7/15/1999	Increase in Ford's Earnings Tops Wall Street Estimates	The American automobile market, widely dismissed a few years ago as too competitive and glutted to be profitable, carried the Ford Motor Company to earnings that were better than expected in the second quarter. Strong United States sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks offset losses in South America and deteriorating results in Europe. A $146 million one-time charge related to Ford's acquisition of Volvo's car making operations in March depressed earnings, which fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier, to $2.34 billion, or $1.89 per share. This was 4 cents better than the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, according to First Call.
7/15/1999	Hertz Considers An Acquisition	The Hertz Corporation, the world's largest car-rental company, said today that it might buy a vehicle-leasing unit from the Ford Motor Company as the latest step to expand into businesses with steadier revenue. Hertz said it was conducting a financial review of AMI Leasing of Worcester, Mass., which is owned by the Ford subsidiary Automotive Management. Hertz indicated that AMI had revenue of about $210 million last year, less than 5 percent of Hertz' $4.25 billion.
7/13/1999	Ford May Receive Incentives To Build Auto Plant in Brazil	The Ford Motor Company may receive an incentives package from the Government of more than $700 million to build a car factory in Brazil's impoverished Northeast. The proposed package, reported in Brazilian newspapers today, has created a political controversy over the use of public funds to aid job creation in some regions over others.
7/9/1999	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Books; The Humble Bug, and How It Grew	HE summer reading season coincides with the summer driving season. Here, just in time for perusal at poolside or in a beach-bound traffic jam, is a look at some new books with automotive themes. BEETLE BOOKS -- When Adolf Hitler was imprisoned in 1923, he spent his time writing ''Mein Kampf'' and reading a biography of Henry Ford, which helped to inspire the future dictator's vision of a ''people's car.''
7/7/1999	Auto Industry Focuses Talks On Health Care	The soaring cost of prescription drugs for aging auto workers and retirees is the top health care issue in national labor talks pitting the United Automobile Workers union against General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler A.G., auto executives said. While many industries face rising costs for pharmaceutical benefits, the auto makers said they had particularly acute problems. Benefits consultants, who compare costs in various industries, agree.
7/3/1999	G.M. and Ford Report Gains In June Car and Truck Sales	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company reported today that their car and truck sales edged higher last month as the entire auto industry recorded its best June in history and its second-best month ever. Industry sales of cars and light trucks totaled 1.6 million vehicles last month, a 2 percent increase over the blistering sales pace of a year ago. That put the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate at 17 million vehicles -- 9 million cars and 8 million trucks, according to Ward's Communications, a Detroit publisher.
7/3/1999	HERTZ CONSIDERING ACQUISITION OF FORD'S AXUS UNIT	The Hertz Corporation, the car rental company, said yesterday that it was considering buying the Ford Motor Company's Axus International unit, which leases a fleet of cars, primarily in Europe. Axus International, based in London, was a Hertz unit before 1995. A re-acquisition would require Government approval and an independent evaluation. Hertz, based in Park Ridge, N.J., said an acquisition of Axus is consistent with its strategy of developing its core businesses. The company said the deal could be made within 60 to 90 days.
6/23/1999	Russian Financial Eclipse Is an Opportunity for Ford	Looking beyond Russia's severe economic problems, the Ford Motor Company announced a preliminary agreement with the Government today to begin construction in July of an automobile factory near St. Petersburg. Although Ford's financial contribution is only $150 million, the plant would be among the largest foreign investment projects in Russia since the financial crisis that began last summer. A final agreement on the plant is expected in the next few weeks.
6/18/1999	Ford Raises Productivity At Its Plants	The big difference in labor productivity between American and Japanese auto makers in the 1980's, then a matter of considerable dismay in the United States, has been sharply reduced by Ford, but General Motors and DaimlerChrysler still lag, according to a comprehensive study released today. Two decades ago, Japanese car makers enjoyed a labor cost advantage of roughly $1,000 a vehicle, adjusted for inflation, according to Harbour & Associates, a manufacturing-consultant in Troy, Mich., which published its annual productivity report today. The labor cost difference has persisted for G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, which have only improved as quickly as the Japanese makers.
6/11/1999	FORD LAYOFFS EXTENDED	The Ford Motor Company's Brazilian unit extended layoffs for 2,000 workers at its main plant by three months because of weak sales, unions said. Ford's metalworkers, who were laid off at the beginning of the year, were expected to return to the assembly line this month. The workers are still receiving 80 percent of their salaries, the Metalworkers Union said. Ford officials could not be reached for comment.
6/11/1999	FORD IN DEAL FOR ADMINISTRATOR OF SERVICE CONTRACTS	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Automobile Protection Corporation for $180 million as part of its push to keep customers after they buy a car or truck. Ford will pay $13 a share for Automobile Protection, which has 200 employees and will retain its management. The company, based in Atlanta, is the administrator of Easy Care Vehicle Service contracts sold mainly through dealerships. The move comes after Ford bought Kwik-Fit Holdings P.L.C., Europe's largest independent car service chain, for $:1.01 billion ($1.63 billion) in April. Ford shares fell 25 cents, to $55, while Automobile Protection shares rose 43.75 cents, to $13.1875.
6/9/1999	Auto Negotiations Are Likely to Aim for a Longer Pact	With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest such deal since the 1950's, auto executives and union officials say. Chastened by last summer's 54-day strike against G.M. in Flint, Mich., and enjoying the soaring profits and bountiful overtime pay produced by record auto sales, management and workers appear eager to avoid another showdown this year. Serious differences could still produce a strike, but industry and union leaders alike are now using the tamest rhetoric in many years.
6/6/1999	American Women at the Wheel; Explorer Sport Seems to Have What They Want	WHEN I entered the working world full time in the late 1970's, I couldn't wait until I'd saved enough from my meager paychecks to buy my first brand-new car. I wanted something small, nimble, sleek and sporty. And red. That, of course, was before trucks ruled the earth. Now a young career woman's fancy often turns not to cute little sports cars, but to rugged, assertive sport utilities. It seems women are passing up Ralph Fiennes for a fling with Bruce Willis.
6/5/1999	Ford Discount on Volvos	The Ford Motor Company, the world's second-largest auto maker, will allow employees and retirees in the United States to buy or lease Volvo cars at a discount beginning with the 2000 model year. Ford acquired Volvo's car business for $6.45 billion earlier this year. Ford's employees and their families are already able to buy Ford cars and trucks for less than what the company charges its dealers.
6/3/1999	Vehicle Sales Increased by 5.3% in May	Auto executives were exuberant today as May's car and truck sales propelled the industry toward its best year ever. Despite weak results from the General Motors Corporation, the industry's sales rose 5.3 percent in May compared with results in the period a year earlier, when sales were also stellar. Last month's seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 17.3 million was surpassed only by a rate of 17.8 million set in December 1986. Anything more than an annual rate of 15 million rate is considered strong.
6/3/1999	A Boom Built on Big Wheels; Sales of Light Trucks Drive the Auto Industry's Expansion	Craig J. Thomas stands near the end of DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s assembly line in Fenton, Mo., and waits for a spindly orange robot to lower a pickup bed to meet the rest of a Dodge Ram truck. Then, 37 times an hour, 300 times a day, he bolts the bed to the truck and waits for the next pickup to reach him. In mid-May, he got a break from the rhythm of the robots to celebrate with other workers: the company said it would spend $435 million to expand the Ram factory.
6/2/1999	Bozell Hires Ford Executive	A marketing executive from the automotive industry is joining a big agency. Ian Beavis, 46, marketing communications manager for the Lincoln Mercury division of the Ford Motor Company, has joined the Bozell Worldwide unit of True North Communications in the new post of global account director.
5/30/1999	G.M. Removes Itself From Industrial Pedestal	Though often misquoted and taken out of context, a remark by Charles E. Wilson that ''for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa,'' has long stood for the view that the business of America is very big business, so get out of the way. Whatever G.M.'s president was driving at in 1953, if he made the comment today it would have to be ''What's good for Ford Motor is good for America.''
5/29/1999	SUGAR-COATED PRESSURE	Brazil's Government and its powerful sugar lobby have persuaded Ford and General Motors to make ethanol-powered automobiles for the domestic market. The agreement will benefit a sugar industry hurt by low prices and the dominance of gasoline-fueled cars. Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, was once the leader in promoting ethanol, a cleaner-burning fuel that can be made from sugar or corn. The agreement came in conjunction with a wider accord cutting taxes on cars in exchange for pledges by auto makers to limit layoffs. It was unclear how many ethanol cars would be produced. Simon Romero (NYT)
5/23/1999	Wedding or Wipe-Out?	A CANDID version of the advice that the Ford Motor Company might offer its competitor, Renault S.A., on making an investment in a Japanese car company would probably be something like this: Get ready for a long, hard trek, because the payoff won't come quickly. Ford's 20-year, $624 million odyssey with a Japanese car maker, the Mazda Motor Corporation, has so far produced a lot of headaches. But since Renault has already plunked down $5.4 billion to buy a 36.8 percent stake in the sputtering Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, avoiding the potential potholes is no longer an option.
5/21/1999	Ford Officer Leaving to Seek Other Job Possibilities	Eager to be a chief executive someday, John M. Devine, the Ford Motor Company's chief financial officer and executive vice president, announced today that he would retire at the end of September and intended to pursue ''wider responsibilities'' elsewhere. Mr. Devine, who was passed over last year to become Ford's president and chief executive, said that turning 55 last week had made him realize that he had to move to another company soon, if at all. ''It certainly caused me to think over the last several months about where I am and what I want to be,'' he said in a telephone conference call with reporters today.
5/21/1999	Mazda Reports First Annual Profit in 6 Years	The Mazda Motor Corporation, the Japanese car maker controlled by the Ford Motor Company, reported its first annual profit in six years today and its best results in 14 years, the clearest sign that Ford's efforts to turn the company around are succeeding. What's more, the company predicted it would set record profits and increase sales in the fiscal year that ends next March, a period during which other Japanese car companies are expecting their profits to slide.
5/19/1999	Special Team Cars Are Looking for a Few Good Buyers	THE ''grabber orange'' paint is bright enough to singe retinas, visible proof of how hot a car is Ford's Special Vehicle Team Mustang Cobra R. At the recent unveiling of the 2000 model before a group of devoted Mustang owners, Ford's specialty vehicle marketing manager, Tom Scarpello, trumpeted the new car as ''the fastest production Mustang in its 35-year history.'' Only 300 will be made, and the price has not been set, but the impact of the S.V.T. Cobra R goes beyond sales: It may be a limited edition, but car companies use special team vehicles to burnish entire brands.
5/19/1999	From Mother's Ugly Duckling To Chic and Expensive Swan	CINDY BURROWS had it all: a successful husband, three bright, attractive children and a showplace home on Philadelphia's Main Line with a fully loaded, leather-upholstered Chrysler Town and Country van in the driveway. Then her oldest son went away to college and her true feelings emerged. ''I hate vans,'' she said. ''The only reason I bought one was because I was driving three kids around. As soon as Jeb went away to college, I started looking for something different.''
5/18/1999	Ford Pickups' Air Pollution To Be Cut to That of Cars	The Ford Motor Company said today that starting this autumn its new pickup trucks, including the nation's best-selling vehicle, would produce no more air pollution than that of cars. Because of more lenient Federal standards that have existed for a quarter-century, full-sized pickups and sport utility vehicles are allowed to produce two and a half times as much smog-causing gas as cars and will be allowed to produce five times as much next year when tighter rules for cars take effect.
5/14/1999	The Newest Ford Generation Takes the Company Spotlight	The gadfly investor Evelyn Y. Davis called him King William, and so he was: the heir to leadership of the Ford Motor Company, William C. Ford Jr., took the stage today to run the family-controlled company's annual meeting for the first time. Ford is a 96-year-old dynasty of industrial America, but it used information-age technology today to introduce its 42-year-old chairman to shareholders here and even to viewers in Times Square in New York City, where the first 30 minutes of the annual meeting were broadcast live on a giant TV screen this morning.
5/12/1999	Ford Parts Unit In French Acquisition	The Ford Motor Company's Visteon unit, the second-largest maker of automobile parts in the world, is buying the automotive interiors business of Plastic Omnium S.A. of France for 457 million euros, or about $492 million.
5/7/1999	Training Ford's Luxury Quartet to Sing in 4-Part Harmony	UNTIL recently, the Ford Motor Company's only prestige brand was Lincoln, which for decades was No. 2 to Cadillac in the American luxury market but was virtually unknown in much of the world. But in March, with Ford having acquired a fourth luxury marque, the company formed the Premier Automotive Group as an umbrella for Lincoln, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo. That group is selling twice as many luxury cars as General Motors, and within five years its divisions expect to add at least 250,000 sales, putting Ford on par with the BMW Group and DaimlerChrysler, which produces Mercedes-Benz automobiles. If its luxury sales increase as much as Ford anticipates, the company's profits will rise by more than $500 million a year. As Ford's group vice president, Wolfgang Reitzle is in charge of the Premier Automotive Group. He is also chairman of Jaguar Cars of Britain and Volvo Cars of Sweden, and he is responsible for insuring that Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo and Aston Martin do not steal customers from one another.
5/7/1999	Louis R. Ross, 67; Ex-Ford Vice Chairman Had Key Taurus Role	Louis R. Ross, a former vice chairman of the Ford Motor Company who oversaw the introduction in 1985 of the Ford Taurus, which became one of its most successful cars and helped the company recover from low profits and quality problems, died on Sunday in Naples, Fla. He was 67. Neither the funeral home nor the company knew the cause, and family members could not be reached.
5/4/1999	Several Big Auto Makers Posted Robust April Sales	In a further sign of consumers' willingness to keep spending in a robust economy, auto sales maintained their sizzling pace in April. The Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., Toyota, Honda and Nissan, along with a number of smaller auto makers, reported strong sales today, and the industry as a whole is on track to match or beat its vigorous sales pace of last April.
5/4/1999	G.M. to Build Brazil Factory As Model for Future Plants	The General Motors Corporation has reached an agreement on terms for completion of a futuristic factory in a southern Brazilian state, which last week lost a similar project planned by the Ford Motor Company because of disagreements on how it would be financed. In an accord reached on Saturday, G.M. agreed to earlier repayments on a loan of about $150 million extended by the state of Rio Grande do Sul so the car maker could move forward with the plant, an innovative assembly operation known as Blue Macaw expected to produce 120,000 subcompact automobiles a year.
5/2/1999	It's the Extras That Count	VIRTUALLY every manufacturer has minivan ergonomics down pat. After all, functionality, comfort and convenience are the reasons people drive these mobile dens. So other factors now count: Four doors have become essential for convenience (and for children's safety on one-way streets). Power-operated sliding doors win extra credit. I also appreciate extra horsepower and nimble, car-like handling. Clever ideas, like well-placed storage nets and power outlets, are a big plus.
5/2/1999	Rating Vans: Who Has the Best Family Room for the Road?	CHRYSLER created the modern minivan, and for 15 years it has successfully fended off the arrows of a pack of challengers. But the rivals keep coming with ever more potent weapons, including new vans this year from Ford and Honda (on the heels of improved competition from General Motors and Toyota). But just as van makers figured out what customers want in a family vehicle -- from extra doors to cup holders to secondary music sources with headphone jacks -- the market has cooled. Although sales have picked up nicely this year, they remain below their 1994 peak, and rebates and discounts are common. Sport utility vehicles are one reason, and rebellion against the vans' soccer-mom image is another.
5/2/1999	From Skeptic To Admirer	I HAD not cared much for minivans, preferring the handling of even a station wagon over these boxes on wheels. Then I took a family trip in a Plymouth Grand Voyager, hauled home a Christmas tree on the roof of a Toyota Sienna and took some Cub Scouts camping in a Ford Windstar.
4/30/1999	Ford Drops Factory Plan For Brazil	In a decision highlighting how government overspending has hampered foreign investment in Brazil, the Ford Motor Company has abandoned plans to build an innovative $1 billion factory in a southern Brazilian state, which refused to honor a pledge to provide the company with financial incentives because of a budget crisis. Ford, which said it might search for another site for its factory, called the Project Amazon, made the announcement in a statement Wednesday after a month of negotiating with the government of Rio Grande do Sul, a state on Brazil's southern tip controlled by the opposition Workers Party. Ford already assembles cars at other factories in Brazil.
4/27/1999	New Ford Division to Focus On Recycling of Auto Parts	The Ford Motor Company intends to become the world's largest automotive recycler by buying existing recyclers and building its own auto recycling centers to provide used parts, the company announced today. Ford expects the new subsidiary, which has not been named, to add $1 billion in revenue within a few years by taking apart old cars and trucks and reselling the parts to body shops, insurers and consumers. Company officials did not project profits.
4/25/1999	Now, Dad, Can I Borrow the Keys?	SO, you gave dad that half-mile oval driveway last Father's Day and are looking for the right accessory. Neiman Marcus's ''Oh Boy, Toys'' catalogue has it: Mark Martin's Winston Cup Taurus. The hand-built racing car, which the retailer says is one that Martin actually drove, costs $125,000 and has a 352-cubic-inch engine that produces 800 horsepower. It has no headlights, emission controls or mufflers, so it cannot be used on public roads. But that has its advantages: There are no luxury-car or gas-guzzler taxes (and it does guzzle, getting only 4 to 5 m.p.g.).
4/21/1999	2 U.S. Auto Makers Delay New Factories in Brazil	Citing the pressure from other priorities on his state's finances, an opposition Governor in southern Brazil has disrupted plans by General Motors and the Ford Motor Company to build two car factories regarded as prototypes for automobile manufacturing of the future. G.M. has delayed by at least six months its plans to produce compact cars at a plant code-named the ''Blue Macaw'' project in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state. The delay could affect the auto maker's plans for similar plants in the United States and elsewhere. Ford has put on hold plans to build a plant for its ''Project Amazon,'' also intended to produce inexpensive small cars.
4/17/1999	Chief Was Paid $73 Million In Last Year, Ford Discloses	Alex Trotman received more than $73 million in his last year of leading the Ford Motor Company, although Graef Crystal, the compensation expert, said Mr. Trotman might have deserved more during a period when Ford's shares rose 82 percent. Ford paid Mr. Trotman $18.8 million in salary, bonus and other compensation in 1998, his final year as chairman and chief executive of the world's second-largest auto maker, after the General Motors Corporation. He received $24.1 million more for a 1997 incentive-plan payment, and gained $30.1 million from exercising previously granted stock options, the company said in a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. G.M. is to file next week.
4/16/1999	Ford and G.M. Post Increases in Earnings	Cashing in on very strong sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the United States, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company today posted increases in operating earnings during the first quarter that were even larger than financial analysts had expected. Americans bought a record 16.9 million cars and trucks in the first quarter, and that meant both companies' factories in the United States were struggling to keep pace, while the need for rebates and other discounts dwindled. The auto makers' car loan divisions and European subsidiaries made more modest profits, while they lost money in Latin America and East Asia.
4/16/1999	The Pony Car Turns 35	TOMORROW is the 35th anniversary of the introduction of the Mustang, which was unveiled at the New York World's Fair in April 1964. Although it may be too late to park your Mustang among the 3,000 expected at Lowe's Motor Speedway (formerly Charlotte Motor Speedway) in Concord, N.C., where the Mustang Club of America is holding its anniversary get-together through Sunday, there are plenty of products on sale all year to help one celebrate. The Ford Motor Company is selling a set of 41 Mustang trading cards for $9.95 and a commemorative poster for $6.95; they can be ordered by calling (877) 359-3277. There's also a Mustang edition of Monopoly, with pewter playing pieces including a '65 fastback and the original front grille. (No, the ''Go to Jail'' square is not represented by the unloved Mustang II).
4/13/1999	Ford to Buy Kwik-Fit Holdings Of Scotland for $1.63 Billion	The Ford Motor Company agreed today to buy the Scottish car-repair chain Kwik-Fit Holdings P.L.C. for $:1.01 billion ($1.63 billion) in cash to expand its service business and sell more Ford parts. Under the accord, made through Ford's FAH Investments unit, the auto maker is to pay 560 pence for each Kwik-Fit share, 33 percent more than the Friday closing price of the company, which is Europe's largest independent car-service chain.
4/3/1999	NISSAN MAY END DAIMLERCHRYSLER TRUCK PACT	In the first sign of an overhaul after selling a 37 percent stake to Renault S.A. the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, said yesterday that it might end its light-truck venture with DaimlerChrysler A.G. DaimlerChrysler had been in talks about taking a stake in Nissan but abandoned those plans last month. ''Renault aside, we're reviewing each of our product plans, and the same goes for trucks,'' a Nissan spokeswoman, Miki Obana, said. The company declined to comment on a report in a Japanese newspaper, Nihon Keizai, that it might also end its agreement to make minivans with the Ford Motor Company. Ford would say only that it has an agreement with Nissan to produce minivans through 2004.
4/2/1999	When Two Would Be a Crowd: The Case of the Missing S.U.V.	IT woke up to be the king of the hill and the top of the heap, but the Ford Excursion, the world's largest sport utility vehicle, is not coming to New York, New York. At least it will not make it there for the New York auto show, which opens tomorrow at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Instead, the Ford Motor Company is spreading the news in New York about its restyled and updated 2000 Taurus. Ford will not even have its 2000 Excursion on display -- an unusual absence for an all-new model at the nation's best-attended auto show.
3/31/1999	Requiem for the Middleweights; Ho-Hum Taurus Marks End of Midsize Sedan as Style's Pace Car	Remember the first Ford Taurus? When the car was introduced in late 1985, its smooth, aerodynamic curves shook up the design of midsize sedans. And despite fears that its radical look would turn off car buyers, sales took off almost immediately. Moreover, its success was one of the early signs of the resurgence of the Ford Motor Company, which today is at the brink of surpassing the General Motors Corporation as the largest auto maker in the world. Well, Ford just unveiled the new Taurus yesterday at the New York International Auto Show. But do not look for any surprises. While it may sell well if it is priced cheaply enough, it is unlikely to win any contests for style. Indeed, the most distinctive thing about the new Taurus is probably how indistinguishable it is from all the other lookalike midsize sedans.
3/22/1999	An Entertainment Weekly series aims to give marketers an association with popular culture.	WHEN the Beatles came to America, they were dubbed the Fab Four. Thirty-five years later, an elaborate marketing and promotional program centered on popular culture is being called the Fab 400. Has inflation really been that drastic since 1964?
3/21/1999	Behind the Labor Peace at Ford	When the General Motors Corporation was paralyzed by a 54-day strike last summer, several Wall Street analysts offered the same solution: G.M.'s leaders should go to the home of Peter J. Pestillo, the longtime labor czar of the Ford Motor Company, and offer him any sum of money, no matter how large, to fix their problems. G.M. never took this unsolicited advice, and the strike cost it $2 billion in after-tax profits. But Wall Street's perspective highlighted the reputation of Mr. Pestillo, one of the most influential yet least known executives in corporate America.
3/9/1999	Volvo Approves Sale of Car Business	Volvo's shareholders voted yesterday to accept the sale of Volvo Cars to the Ford Motor Company for 50 billion kronor ($6.45 billion). The decision completes the sale of the car division, which was announced on Jan. 28. Volvo said earlier yesterday that since the sale to Ford would bring it large amounts of cash at a time when interest rates were low it intended to buy back some of its shares, worth up 10 billion kronor ($1.2 billion), later this year.
3/3/1999	Major Auto Makers Report Record Sales	Most major auto makers, including the Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G. and American Honda, reported record sales for February. ''Since the end of the General Motors strike in August, the industry has had an incredible run of monthly records,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham Securities in New York. ''The reasons are the usual suspects. Car prices are reasonable, if not declining. Employment levels and consumer confidence are very high. Used-car prices are strong, making trade-ins worth more and causing people to buy new cars instead of used ones.''
3/2/1999	Newly Merged Chrysler Loses 2 Executives To Rival Ford	Two senior executives from the DaimlerChrysler Corporation joined the Ford Motor Company today, the latest of several departures by executives of the former Chrysler Corporation since its merger last November with Daimler-Benz A.G. The Daimler-Chrysler deal was presented as an alliance of equals. But auto industry experts have increasingly viewed the merger as a takeover by the German company. The loss of high-level executives is particularly unusual in an industry in which managers have traditionally stayed their entire careers with a single company.
2/27/1999	Ford Adds Bars to Make a Large Sport Vehicle Safer	The Ford Motor Company today introduced the first design change to make the rising number of huge sport utility vehicles a little safer in crashes with cars. It said its newest sport utility vehicle, a behemoth that would be the tallest and heaviest yet, would be equipped with hollow steel bars mounted below the front and rear bumpers to prevent it from riding over cars during collisions. The horizontal steel beams hang down six inches from the high-riding steel frame of the vehicle, the Ford Excursion, which is nearly seven feet tall and weighs more than three tons.
2/18/1999	Chroniclers of Collaboration; Historians Are in Demand to Study Corporate Ties to Nazis	Last year, Greg Bradsher, a senior archivist at the National Archives, got an urgent request from the Ford Motor Company not long after the car maker was named in a lawsuit accusing it of profiting from its German operations in the Nazi era. Ford's idea: To send a SWAT team of 30 researchers to a Government document repository so they could hunt down every scrap of paper dealing with Ford's activities in World War II.
2/15/1999	Fourth Ford Worker Dies	A fourth Ford employee died from severe burns today, two weeks after an explosion at Ford Motor Company's River Rouge complex. The employee, Ken Anderson, 44, died about 9:30 A.M. in the Detroit Receiving Hospital Burn Center, said a hospital spokeswoman, Mattie Majors.
2/14/1999	Making Tons of Money and Fords, Too	TWO weeks ago, the Ford Motor Company agreed to pay $6.5 billion for the car operations of Volvo of Sweden. Last week, Ford hinted that it might also be interested in buying Germany's BMW -- and with more than $17 billion in cash remaining in the company kitty, Ford can easily afford it. How did Ford, which is known for its plebeian, low-profit Escorts and Tauruses, accumulate wealth on a scale not seen since Japanese companies were buying up American real estate in the 1980's? A big part of the answer lies in this gritty industrial suburb west of Detroit, home to what appears to be the world's most profitable factory in any industry.
2/11/1999	Gingerly, Ford Chief Discusses BMW	Jacques Nasser, chief executive and president of the Ford Motor Company, said today that Ford would not try to buy BMW A.G. as long as BMW wanted to remain independent. He hinted, however, that Ford would be interested in buying the German auto maker if it put itself up for sale. BMW's board replaced the company's chairman last Friday, in a sudden move that most industry executives attributed to the poor performance of Britain's Rover, which BMW bought in 1994. BMW officials have insisted since then that they want to remain independent, but its stock has risen on the expectation that pressure will increase for BMW to seek a merger.
2/5/1999	FORD RESUMES PRODUCTION AT ALL BUT 2 ASSEMBLY PLANTS	The Ford Motor Company resumed full production yesterday at all but two of its United States assembly plants as its complex near Detroit geared up after a power plant explosion killed one worker on Monday. Ford said it hoped to have power restored to the complex in Dearborn, Mich., seven miles west of Detroit, by today. The auto maker hauled in generators and resumed partial production Wednesday at its frame, engine and stamping assembly lines. Two other parts factories and the assembly plant for the Mustang car are still idled, as is an assembly plant in Wixom, Mich. Detroit Edison will provide power for the complex because the blast destroyed the power plant.
2/3/1999	Car Makers Get Strong Start To 1999 Sales	Ford, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota and other auto makers sold new family vehicles at a blistering pace in January, a sign that the American economy's torrid growth in the fourth quarter is carrying over into the new year. With gasoline prices continuing to fall, sales of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans soared in January, rising 19 percent at DaimlerChrysler A.G. from a year earlier, 20 percent at the Ford Motor Company and 32 percent at the Toyota Motor Corporation. But car sales were also brisk after months of weakness, with DaimlerChrysler and Toyota reporting large increases while Ford's car sales dropped only because of a reduction in unprofitable car sales to rental agencies.
2/3/1999	Ford Tries to Avoid Closings In Wake of Factory Explosion	The Ford Motor Company struggled today to keep a serious industrial accident that paralyzed its River Rouge manufacturing complex from causing shutdowns at other factories across North America. The explosion and fire Monday killed one Ford worker, critically burned 13 and left at least a dozen more workers seriously injured. It also idled 10,000 at the complex in this southwest Detroit suburb.
2/2/1999	Explosion At Ford Plant Kills Worker	A thunderous explosion, followed by a fire that burned for several hours, killed one worker and injured at least 30 today at the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge complex, long a symbol of American industrial strength that put the nation on wheels by building the Model T. The explosion and fire heavily damaged the complex's power plant, which normally produces enough electricity to supply the residential needs of a city the size of Boston. Ford and Rouge Steel, a subsidiary here that Ford sold a decade ago, were forced to close all six factories in the 1,100-acre Rouge complex and send home almost all 10,000 workers until further notice.
1/31/1999	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Windstar; At Last, 4-Door Utility With 5-Star Safety	ALTHOUGH the seeds that grew into the modern minivan were initially planted at the Ford Motor Company, that auto maker has usually lagged behind the Chrysler Corporation in the minivan race. It was a Ford engineer, Harold K. Sperlich, who in the 1970's came up with the idea of a van big enough to haul a family but small enough to fit in a standard garage. (Granted, vehicles like the VW Microbus and Corvair Greenbrier had been there before.) Mr. Sperlich's boss, Lee A. Iacocca, took the proposal to top management, but they dismissed it as too risky, given the cost it would entail. When the two men wound up at Chrysler in the early 1980's, they resurrected the idea and the minivan was born. A concept deemed too risky for Ford ended up saving Chrysler from extinction.
1/31/1999	Even a Minivan Can Use Some Mothering	WHILE serving as vehicle line director, supervising the development of the 1999 Ford Windstar, Mary Ellen Heyde was struck by the unusually large number of women with young children who were working on the redesign. She thought it made sense to tap the maternal expertise of these 30 ''Windstar moms,'' most of them engineers, and she consulted them routinely as the design progressed. With the aim of making the minivan more family-friendly, the mothers offered suggestions for innovations and improvements.
1/30/1999	Ford-Volvo: A Deal for All Sweden	Having heard and read rumors for months that Volvo A.B. was in merger talks with one big car company or another, Bengt Persson was almost relieved to finally know that his employer would soon be the Ford Motor Company. ''At least it wasn't Fiat,'' said Mr. Persson, who has worked in the automobile assembly plant here for more than two decades. ''If the company had to be sold to someone, this was probably the best choice.''
1/29/1999	The Ford Ka Faces Hurdle In Japan	The steering wheel is on the right-hand side and the air-conditioning system was specially designed to stand up to Japan's sticky summers, but the Ford Ka, the most visible plank of the Ford Motor Company's efforts to resuscitate its gasping business here, may have a tough road ahead. The car that Ford is counting on to burnish its image in Japan, where its market share is one-half of 1 percent, went on sale today for delivery in late March. Eiji Iwakuni, a former Honda executive, has been hired to turn Ford around here.
1/29/1999	Ford-Volvo Tie: Europe Rivals at Risk	The Ford Motor Company's victorious bid for Volvo A.B.'s car business increases the pressure on other European automobile companies to either buy or be bought, industry executives and analysts say. Those with the most precarious futures are middle-sized companies like Renault S.A. and PSA Peugeot Citroen of France and, as it clearly recognized by trying to buy Volvo itself, Fiat S.p.A. of Italy. Each of those companies lacks the size to compete with the giants like DaimlerChrysler A.G. or the General Motors Corporation. On top of that, they remain bogged down in brutally competitive markets for midsized and small cars.
1/29/1999	Ford Buys Volvo Car Unit in Bid To Lift Profile of Luxury Models	The Ford Motor Company, by agreeing yesterday to buy the car operations of Volvo A.B. of Sweden for $6.45 billion, has taken its biggest step yet toward becoming a large-scale seller of high-profit luxury cars as well as more humble vehicles like the Escort and pickup trucks. Ford has already bought Jaguar and Aston Martin in recent years, but the acquisition of Volvo, a favorite of affluent urban families in the Northeastern United States and northern Europe, represents a far greater bet on the luxury market. Sales of luxury cars are rising in the United States and Europe while auto makers' profits on less expensive cars have evaporated as low-cost manufacturers in places like South Korea flood markets in the United States and elsewhere with ever- cheaper cars.
1/28/1999	Ford Seen in Deal To Pay $6 Billion For Volvo Car Unit	The Ford Motor Company plans to announce today that it will acquire the passenger car operations of Sweden's A.B. Volvo for between $6 billion and $7 billion, people close to the talks said last night. Ford's deal, which beat a rival bid from Italy's Fiat S.p.A. marks the latest step in the consolidation of the global automotive industry. Giant multinationals are taking over independent companies with strong brand names but limited production capacity and inadequate global distribution.
1/24/1999	Don't Trust Car Dealers? Here's a New Deal	DONALD THORNTON, a successful Ford dealer here for many years, still recalls his anger on the day three decades ago when his daughter Kathy, then 7, came home from a birthday party in tears. ''This little kid next to her -- the little worm, I could choke him -- leaned over and said, 'My daddy says all car salesmen are crooks,' '' Mr. Thornton recounted recently, sitting at the scarred wooden desk across which he has been selling cars since 1973.
1/22/1999	Ford Reports Stronger-Than-Expected Earnings	The Ford Motor Company reported fourth-quarter earnings today that were stronger than expected, as the giant auto maker also pressed ahead in its efforts to buy the car business of Sweden's Volvo. Ford said that it earned $1.04 billion during the quarter, a 41.9 percent drop from a year earlier because Ford took $631 million in one-time, after-tax charges and because Ford spun off a profitable consumer lending unit last spring.
1/19/1999	Ford Agrees to Pay Plan for Argentine Workers	The Ford Motor Company said today that it had agreed to a 15-month staggered payment plan for 1,400 idled workers in Argentina, where the industry has suffered a drop in output because of the weakened economies in Argentina and Brazil. A spokesman for Ford Argentine, Rodolfo Ceretti, said workers can either take a retirement package or receive $700 a month for five months and then $600 a month for the next 10 months. If the workers are not rehired, the final $3,000 in pay will be deducted from their severance pay.
1/17/1999	Double-Edged Economic Crisis Whipsaws Brazil Workers and Companies	For 22 years and 4 months, Luiz Porfirio Diniz reported daily to the bustling Ford do Brasil automotive plant here, where three different car models are manufactured. But then just before Christmas, he got the bad news he had been fearing ever since Brazilian interest rates shot to nearly 50 percent four months ago: He was one of 2,800 assembly-line workers being laid off. Employees took over the plant on Jan. 5 to protest that move, so Mr. Diniz still spends his day on the plant floor, playing dominos with his fellow workers. The stoppage means that Ford is no longer producing its daily quota of 1,000 cars, but the company has not moved against the workers -- perhaps because car sales are declining so dramatically in Brazil that Ford has the equivalent of nearly two months of production stockpiled in storage areas here.
1/15/1999	FORD TO TAKE $630 MILLION IN FOURTH-QUARTER CHARGES	The Ford Motor Company, the world's No. 2 auto maker, said that it would take $630 million in fourth-quarter after-tax charges for a loss on the sale of its stake in the Kia Motors Corporation, early retirement programs and a new joint venture. Ford said last week that it would take a pretax charge of at least $250 million for North American and European job cuts and the sale of its Kia stake. The pretax amount of the charges announced today total $950 million. Ford sold its 9.4 percent stake in Kia last month to J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. for about $11 million. Ford stock fell $1, to $60.375. The amount of the charges was announced after the close of trading in New York.
1/15/1999	G.M. WINS TAX-FREE STATUS FOR DELPHI SPINOFF	The General Motors Corporation's planned spinoff of its Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation parts unit was granted tax-free status by the Internal Revenue Service. General Motors plans to sell 17.7 percent of Delphi's stock in an initial public offering before the end of March. The ruling clears the way for a distribution of the remaining 82.3 percent stake to G.M. shareholders. The underwriting group plans to market each share at $14 to $18. That would imply that Delphi's initial market value is as high as $10.2 billion.
1/13/1999	Ford Has Told Volvo It Is Interested in Buying Car Unit	The Ford Motor Company has told Volvo A.B. that it would be interested in acquiring the Swedish company's car division if it were put up for sale, but no formal offer has been made nor has Volvo expressed a desire to open formal negotiations, auto executives said today. Ford's expression of interest in Volvo comes after a series of deals -- notably last year's combination of Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation -- has forced smaller companies to reconsider whether they can stay independent indefinitely. Many auto makers are talking informally as they try to figure out what, if anything, they would do if a wave of consolidation swept through the industry this year.
1/13/1999	9 Auto Makers Form Coalition	Nine auto makers announced today that they had formed a new trade association. The members of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers are the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation of the United States; BMW A.G., Volkswagen A.G. and DaimlerChrysler A.G. of Germany; A.B. Volvo of Sweden, and the Mazda Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan.
1/8/1999	Ford's Idea for Safer Safety	IN an effort to reduce injuries caused by air bags and safety belts, the Ford Motor Company plans to add computer controls to its cars and light trucks that would activate safety devices in different ways, depending on the severity of a crash, the size of the car's occupants, the position of the driver's seat and whether safety belts are being used. Ford's advanced restraints system, which will be phased in as vehicle designs are updated, would use a system of sensors to relay information to a central computer in the car, which could adjust the deployment rate of an air bag based on such factors as the force of a crash or how close the driver is to the steering wheel. It would prevent the bag from deploying at all in a minor crash that would be unlikely to cause serious injuries or if the passenger seat was unoccupied or being used by a small child who might be injured by the bag itself.
1/7/1999	Auto Industry Finds Surprises At the End of a Rainbow Year	Last month was the best for auto sales since December 1986, lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in a dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from which the General Motors Corporation has not fully recovered. With the last auto makers reporting their results today, the industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month from December 1997. For the year, a total of 15.55 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8 percent increase from 1997.
1/6/1999	Ford and Chrysler Beat Sales Forecasts	DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the Ford Motor Company beat analysts' December sales forecasts, benefiting from strong truck demand and heavy discounts as the auto industry's second-best United States sales year drew to a close. Ford, the world's No. 2 auto maker, said sales of domestic car and light-truck sales rose 6.1 percent, well above the prediction of a rise of six-tenths of a percent. Chrysler car and light-truck sales for DaimlerChrysler, the No. 5 auto maker, rose 6.9 percent, surpassing the forecast for 5 percent. The General Motors Corporation said it would beat estimates when it reports its sales on Wednesday.
1/5/1999	Merger Rumors Abound at Big Auto Show	When top auto executives gather here each winter for the North American International Auto Show, the talk in the halls is usually about the latest car or, more recently, the latest sport utility vehicle or pickup truck. But at this year's show, there is also another theme: merger rumors. Ever since Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation announced their merger last May, and particularly since the two companies completed the deal last November, the industry has been full of speculation on who might link up next. But top industry officials here said today that while many auto makers were cautiously and tentatively holding discussions, that did not necessarily mean another deal was imminent.
1/3/1999	Ford Eager to Make a Splash	WHEN J. Mays took over the top design post at the Ford Motor Company in October 1997, he boldly promised to put his signature on Ford's cars at the Detroit auto show in 1999. He would begin, he said, by making the company's brands more distinct from one another. Mr. Mays, one of today's most watched car designers, will begin delivering on his promise today with the unveiling of a reborn Thunderbird evocative of the 50's.
12/30/1998	Ford Introduces Sport Utility-Pickup Truck	The Ford Motor Company's Lincoln luxury division has introduced a combination sport utility-pickup truck, the Blackwood, as part of its effort to capture younger buyers and predict the evolution of the light-truck market. The four-door Blackwood is designed off the Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle's platform but includes a 4-foot, 8-inch box similar to a truck bed. A hard top covers the wood-paneled box, which can be opened by a remote control.
12/24/1998	BMW and Volvo Shares Rise On Ford Merger Speculation	Shares in Volvo A.B. jumped 11.4 percent yesterday, and the stock of Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G., or BMW, gained 3.8 percent, as speculation again developed that each car maker was holding talks with the Ford Motor Company that could lead to a merger or another kind of link. Volvo and Ford declined to comment, saying they did not respond to market speculation. BMW said the merger rumors were unfounded.
12/11/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Design; A Suit Makes Them Older and Wiser	FORGET the Fountain of Youth. The Ford Motor Company says it has found value in the opposite -- a suit of clothes that makes its wearer feel old, with stiff joints, dim vision and weak muscles. Ford makes its young designers wear the old costume, on the theory that it gives them empathy for aging customers, and consequently will lead them to design cars that can be used more easily by everyone. The General Motors Corporation is more direct: it has a focus group it calls the Paragon Team, about 30 people with arthritis, vision problems, artificial knees or hips, or other infirmities. It videotapes the team members as they get in and out of vehicles, and as they drive.
12/6/1998	Corporations and Conscience	Americans are understandably ambivalent about the foreign entanglements of American business. Overseas operations can produce profits and support some jobs at home, but they can also help sustain abusive dictatorships and labor practices. In recent years companies like Nike and Unocal have embarrassed themselves with questionable overseas partnerships, but the problem extends far back in American industrial history. The issue was highlighted last week in a Washington Post story on General Motors and Ford operations in Nazi Germany. The Post reported that after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, the chairman of G.M., Alfred P. Sloan, told a shareholder that the internal politics of Nazi Germany ''should not be considered the business of the management of General Motors.'' The company plant in Germany was highly profitable. ''We have no right to shut down the plant,'' Mr. Sloan wrote.
12/2/1998	Journal; What's Good for General Motors . . .	The Swiss banks' stonewall has collapsed. The German industrial giants that exploited slave labor during the war, from Volkswagen to Krupp, are in the crosshairs of class-action suits from Holocaust survivors. In Washington this week 44 nations are represented in a marathon conference co-hosted by the State Department and the Holocaust Memorial Museum to speed the further restitution of Nazi loot, from gold to art. For all this activity, there's been one smaller but not insignificant piece of the story that has received far less scrutiny than the malevolence of the Germans, the Swiss, the French, et al. -- namely, any collaboration between American corporations and the Nazis. On Monday, just as delegates were arriving in Washington for their Holocaust conference, that silence was broken by Michael Dobbs, the Washington Post reporter who last rattled the capital with his revelation of Madeleine Albright's previously unknown Jewish heritage.
11/26/1998	FORD CREDIT PLANS TO BUY THE PRIVATELY HELD AMI LEASING	The Ford Credit Company, the financing arm of the Ford Motor Company, agreed yesterday to buy the privately held AMI Leasing Group as it extended its businesses into fleet management. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. AMI, based in Worcester, Mass., has more than 500 employees and leases cars, trucks and equipment to commercial fleets. AMI's fleet management services, which include managing, maintaining and servicing the vehicles leased to fleets, give Ford Credit, based in Dearborn, Mich., a business it currently does not have.
11/20/1998	Ford Focus Is Off to a Rousing Start	THE Ford Focus, a subcompact that is replacing two distinct Escorts manufactured in Europe and North America, is Europe's car of the year. The award jury comprises automotive journalists from 21 countries. Of the 55 members, 42 gave the Focus their top votes, and it received a total of 444 points, beating the Opel/Vauxhall Astra (272), the Peugeot 206 (249), the Audi TT (235) and the Volvo S80 (175).
11/19/1998	Wheels for Sipowicz?	FOR all of their diversity, the streetscapes of New York City can be boiled down to a few representative elements: a yellow cab, a hot dog stand and a steaming manhole cover. Throw in a light-blue and white police car, and the location is fixed beyond all doubt. Only in New York, kids, only in New York. Unfortunately, that last component of the city's visual signature will soon go the way of all things. One by one, the N.Y.P.D.'s familiar patrol cars, Chevrolet Caprices painted white and a custom shade that the department calls ''grabber blue,'' are being replaced by lily-white Ford Crown Victorias. By 2000, when the transition is complete, New York will be a bit more like everywhere else.
11/14/1998	Capacity Glut Likely to Spur More Auto Mergers	Further large mergers are likely among auto makers because of a worldwide excess of assembly plants and the just-completed marriage of Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation, industry leaders said in interviews this week. Auto makers around the globe have the ability to produce 70 million vehicles a year. But demand has been around 50 million vehicles a year even in good times, and is eroding now with economic slumps in East Asia and Latin America. This week's creation of DaimlerChrysler A.G., in an industry in which big cross-border mergers have historically been hard to accomplish, has forced every auto manufacturer to reassess its strategic options.
11/8/1998	Stockholders Reject Plan to Move British Auto Supplier to U.S.	After a trans-Atlantic tug-of-war over whether LucasVarity P.L.C., the British-based auto components and aerospace company, should move its headquarters to Buffalo, small shareholders delivered a remarkable rebuff to both management and big American investors, voting by a hair's breadth for the company to remain in Britain. With most of Britain's automotive industry -- from stately Rolls-Royce to minuscule Minis -- owned by American, Japanese or German concerns, the battle had assumed jingoistic overtones, particularly among those who fear that Britain has forfeited its manufacturing base to become a nation of service-providers.
11/6/1998	California to Toughen Its Emissions Standards	Despite strong objections from Detroit's Big Three auto makers, environmental regulators in California voted tonight to require cars, minivans and nearly all sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks to meet identical and much more stringent emissions rules. Tonight's vote makes California the first state to impose car emissions standards on so-called light trucks, a category that includes sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks. Regulated as work vehicles, light trucks have been allowed until now to emit up to three times as much pollution per mile as cars.
11/5/1998	October Sales Of Vehicles Still Surprising	The strength of car and truck sales in October continued to surprise Wall Street analysts and auto industry executives as more figures were released today. October turned out to be one of the strongest months in history and puts the industry on track for its best year in a decade. ''I was looking for strong numbers, and these are stronger than I expected,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham Securities in New York. Mr. Healy noted that the stronger sales came about even as incentives began tapering off from the high levels of last spring and summer.
10/30/1998	FORD SAYS IT WILL TEMPORARILY CLOSE 3 ASSEMBLY PLANTS	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would temporarily shut three assembly plants beginning Monday, to prevent inventories from building up. Ford, which is based in Dearborn, Mich., said it would shut down for three weeks its Kansas City, Mo., assembly plant, which builds the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique small cars. A plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, that builds the same models will be idled for one week. Ford's Lorain, Ohio, assembly plant will also temporarily suspend production. That plant, where Econoline vans are made, will be idled for one week because of a shortage of V-8 engines.
10/23/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International; Ford Plays Midwife for Junior Jaguar	THE chairman of Jaguar Cars Ltd., Nicholas V. Scheele, put on a grand party this week on the eve of the British International Motor Show here. It was a beautifully choreographed affair inside a renovated factory in Castle Bromwich, a suburb a few miles up the road. Nearly 1,000 luminaries attended from the worlds of entertainment, sports and the Ford Motor Company -- Jaguar's parent since 1989. There was excellent food and fine wines. On the face of it, the spectacular affair was keyed to the unveiling of a new midsize luxury sedan, the S-Type, which takes direct aim at the BMW 5-Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. But the event had another, unstated purpose: Ford was thumbing its corporate nose at the rivals that had snickered that it paid far too much -- $2.5 billion -- for Jaguar in the late 1980's. The cat is back, and Ford wants the world to know it.
10/22/1998	Thompson Shuffles Its Ford Motor Team	The J. Walter Thompson Company unit of WPP Group P.L.C. said yesterday that it had reorganized the international management team for its important Ford Motor Company account. The entire Ford international brand portfolio handled by Thompson will be merged into a group named the Ford Automotive Global Business Unit, effective on Nov. 1. Before, separate brands like Ford, Mazda, Jaguar, Lincoln, and Mercury were handled by separate teams.
10/21/1998	Six Hot Designers Making Cars Look Cool Again; Father of Reborn Beetle Gets a Big Family at Ford	MOST people don't think twice about telling friends they bought a Jil Sander, a Giorgio Armani or a Joseph Abboud. The very names bespeak the designs. But what about cars and trucks, which cost a lot more than suits and dresses? Who designs them? Although auto companies spend billions of dollars a year to reinforce their brand images, what we're really driving are not BMW's, Chryslers and Fords, but Bangles, Gales and Mayses. After more than a century, auto designers have emerged from the back rooms to be identified with the cars they shape. They appear on magazine covers and represent their companies at industry functions.
10/21/1998	How Do You Add Up Sales Figures? Let Us Count the Ways	WHAT is America's most popular car? It depends on what you mean -- the car bought by the most people or the car that sells the most over all? The difference lies in fleet sales -- these are sales to rental car companies, to corporations and to government agencies that provide cars for their employees, along with sales to businesses that operate fleets of company cars for other corporations. Fleet sales can turn a runner-up into a winner.
10/21/1998	VISTEON UNIT STOCK SALE NOT LIKELY BEFORE 2000	The chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander Trotman, said yesterday that Ford was unlikely to make an initial public offer of stock in its Visteon parts unit before 2000. Mr. Trotman said Ford would like to sell shares of Visteon -- the world's second-biggest auto components maker, after the General Motors Corporation's Delphi Automotive Systems -- but ''it's unlikely to happen in 1999.'' He said that an initial public offering of part of Visteon could help the unit improve its business and reduce its dependence on Ford, but that market turmoil was the main reason for holding back. Mr. Trotman also said that Ford would be closely watching an initial offer by G.M. of Delphi stock, expected in the first quarter of next year.
10/21/1998	Big, Bigger, Biggest End up Pretty Much Even	PACKING the family car for a weekend road trip (and inevitably forgetting something) is an American tradition that dates to the time of the Model T. Since then, the basic goal has never changed: to fit as much as possible into the back of the car. To carry more cargo and people, buyers have traded in their station wagons for minivans and sport utility vehicles, the same way their parents moved from sedans to station wagons a generation ago. But does buying a bigger vehicle mean more usable cargo room? Lorraine and Stephen Pearlman, who live in Montclair, N.J., with their three children, offered to test the cargo space in a station wagon, a minivan and a sport utility vehicle. (To simplify comparisons, the vehicles were Fords: a Taurus, Windstar and Explorer.) The outcome was surprising.
10/21/1998	Bound by an Uncommon Love	IT'S pouring, of course. The rain is coming down in sheets here at the annual picnic of the Portland, Ore., Edsel Owners Club, and all these unwavering fans of the most ill-fated car in American history are huddled under a tree. Twenty loyalists, scratching plastic forks through the greasy puddles atop their potato salad and shivering, improbably, on an August afternoon. They are salt-of-the-earth folks. There's a paunchy couple in matching green rain slickers, and a moment ago, celebrating his refurbished Edsel, the husband said, ''I done the mechanic work and she done the cooking.'' Everyone laughed. But now, in the rain, the Edsel people look vanquished, like a baseball team cowering in the dugout, one out from losing the World Series.
10/21/1998	Struggling in the Wind Tunnel to Keep Its Sound Out	EVEN drivers who love to feel the road don't want to hear it. Over the last 20 years or so, as aerodynamics have shaped car design in the quest for better fuel economy, cars and trucks have become a lot more pleasant to ride in and much less wearying during long trips. That's because reductions in wind noise, a major cause of driver fatigue, are compatible with aerodynamic efficiency.
10/20/1998	Auto Makers Experiment With New Fuels	Struggling to comply with Federal fuel-economy and emissions regulations even as Americans buy ever-bigger family vehicles, auto makers have quietly begun experiments with oil companies to develop new and potentially cleaner fuels. Ford and General Motors have already entered long-term partnerships with oil companies, while Chrysler plans to announce on Wednesday a program with immediate goals: testing vehicles over the next two years that would burn a promising type of synthetic fuel made from natural gas instead of crude oil.
10/15/1998	Ford Says Earnings Rose According to Expectations	The Ford Motor Company announced today that its earnings from continuing operations rose roughly in line with expectations during the third quarter, as cost reductions and record sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the United States offset losses overseas. The General Motors and Chrysler Corporations released their earnings earlier this week, and the overall results show an American auto industry that still has a strong market at home but that is starting to lose money abroad. All of the Big Three have enormous cash reserves to tide them over during the next recession, with Ford announcing today the biggest bankroll of all, a record $22.91 billion as of Sept. 30.
10/10/1998	Ford Shaking Up Senior Executives	The Ford Motor Company said today that 27 senior executives would retire or change jobs at the end of the year, as William Clay Ford Jr. and Jacques A. Nasser began putting their stamp on the company as they move toward becoming chairman and chief executive, respectively, on Jan. 1. The most significant change was the creation of the position of chief of staff -- an unusual title in American industry. Ford also announced the retirement of its general counsel and its top executives for auto manufacturing, auto parts production, engine production, quality control, human resources and public relations.
10/1/1998	FORD AND JARDINE MAY JOIN IN BRITISH CAR RETAILER BID	The Ford Motor Company and Jardine Motors Group P.L.C. said yesterday that they were in talks and had agreed in principle to set up a car retailing venture that might buy Dagenham Motors Group P.L.C., Britain's largest Ford car retailer, which is valued at about $:25 million ($41.5 million). Ford is the world's second-largest car maker behind General Motors, and Jardine is the British motor retailing unit of Jardine International Motor Holdings Ltd. The move comes as car makers increasingly seek to take control of their sales networks in key markets. A joint venture would include the Jardine-owned Ford dealerships in Britain, which include Polar Motor Group Ltd. and BPW Group Ltd.
10/1/1998	G.M. to Open Doors of On-Line National Showroom	THE burgeoning Internet has often been compared with the automobile industry in the early days of mass production. Now the big auto makers want to take more of their business on line. The General Motors Corporation intends to become the first auto maker to offer nationwide Internet shopping for the cars and trucks sitting on participating dealers' lots.
9/26/1998	Economic Detour in Brazil; Global Crisis Pushes Car Makers Into the Slow Lane	The Volkswagen factory here was built for better days. Thanks to aggressive streamlining over the last four years, the plant's 2,304 shift workers, 137 robots and miles of machinery send another boxy Gol subcompact or Parati station wagon into the world every 90 seconds. But finding homes for all of those cars is something else again.
9/21/1998	Ford Tries to Improve Its Marketing Efforts	The Ford Motor Company has agreed to buy multiyear, multimedia advertising packages from Time Inc. and Hachette Filipacchi Magazines as part of an ambitious drive to improve its marketing efforts by sponsoring elaborate sales pitches coordinated with media giants. ''We've asked publishers to come to us with more wide-ranging, broader ideas over and above traditional negotiating ad pages year by year,'' said David Ropes, director for corporate advertising and integrated marketing at Ford in Detroit. The deals, which begin with the 1999 model year on Oct. 1, will involve Ford corporate and customer service advertising, he added, as well as campaigns for the Ford and Lincoln-Mercury divisions, Jaguar and Mazda.
9/20/1998	A Different Sort of Scion	WILLIAM CLAY FORD JR., soon to be chairman of the Ford Motor Company, is not exactly a car man from central casting. The auto industry has been feuding with environmentalists ever since air quality became an issue in the 1960's, but Mr. Ford has long been active in environmental groups. He is a great-grandson of a famously autocratic industrial titan and leads an extended family that still controls 40 percent of Ford's voting stock, but he is happy to share power and the spotlight with Jacques A. Nasser, who will become Ford's president and chief executive.
9/12/1998	The Top Spot at Ford Is Returning to a Ford	One of the most storied families in American business reasserted its control over the world's second-largest company today as William Clay Ford Jr., a great-grandson of Henry Ford, was named the next chairman of the Ford Motor Company. Ford's current chairman, chief executive and president, Alexander Trotman, who is 65, announced that he would retire at the end of December, a year earlier than expected. Mr. Ford, the 41-year-old chairman of the Ford board's committees on finance and the environment, will replace him as chairman of the company then.
9/11/1998	A Sign of the Past	For its 35th anniversary, the Ford Mustang has received a makeover that includes hints of the original pony car. The 1999 Mustang sports edgier lines in keeping with the original 1964 Mustang and with Ford's New Edge design, which uses sharp edges to create surface tension on the metal. Other classic styling cues from the original include a long hood and short deck lid, a prominent hood scoop, triangular side scoops and signature three-element tail lamps. The Mustang emblem on the grille is also reminiscent of the original: the galloping pony is circled by a chrome corral.
9/4/1998	In Wake of Strikes, G.M. Posts August Sales Drop	Still struggling with the aftermath of two strikes, the General Motors Corporation reported yesterday that car and light-truck sales fell 36.4 percent in August. At the same time, the Ford Motor Company reported a stronger-than-expected 8.1 percent increase in sales. G.M.'s lower sales pushed the industry down even though nearly all auto companies selling vehicles in the United States reported higher sales. Vehicle sales for the month totaled 1,229,989 cars and light trucks, a decrease of 6.6 percent compared with sales in the month a year earlier.
9/2/1998	Chrysler Sales Break a Record for August	Sales of Chrysler cars and trucks rose 3.5 percent in August, setting a record for the month, though they were off from the blistering pace of the spring. The Chrysler Corporation sold 186,469 cars and trucks in August, up from 180,131 vehicles in August 1997. The previous August record was set in 1996, when the auto maker sold 186,306 vehicles. This spring, Chrysler had been selling more than 200,000 vehicles a month.
9/1/1998	Auction of Kia Canceled After Low Bids	The auction of two South Korean auto makers was canceled tonight because none of the four initial bids met the sellers' minimum price. Despite robust auto sales in North America and Europe, most of the world's 33 mass-production auto makers are losing money. There are enough surplus auto factories around the globe to supply the entire United States market.
8/26/1998	Union Faults G.M. on Plans for Parts Unit	Leaders of the United Automobile Workers union strongly criticized the General Motors Corporation today, a sign that this summer's strikes in Flint, Mich. did not produce a reconciliation and that next year's national contract talks between G.M. and the U.A.W. will be contentious. Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, condemned G.M.'s announcement on Aug. 3 of plans to spin off its auto parts subsidiary. Asked at a news conference here today what the U.A.W. planned to do about G.M.'s plans, Mr. Yokich said that another strike was always possible, although he added that the union might not do anything until Sept. 14, 1999. That is when the U.A.W.'s current national agreements with G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are all scheduled to expire.
8/24/1998	Ford Bidding To Take Over Korea's Kia	The Ford Motor Company is among four bidders in the race to take over South Korea's ailing Kia Motors Corporation and its truck-building affiliate. A 10-member team is assessing the bids submitted by Ford and three South Korean car makers Friday to take over Kia, which went bankrupt last year and set off a spate of business failures that led to South Korea's financial crisis.
8/22/1998	G.M. DECIDES IT WILL NOT JOIN BIDDING FOR KIA MOTORS	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had decided not to bid for South Korea's insolvent Kia Motors Corporation. But the Ford Motor Company and three Korean companies remained in the race. Ford, already Kia's biggest shareholder, and Hyundai Motor, Daewoo Motor and Samsung Motor submitted bids before the deadline yesterday. G.M. concluded that Kia and its affiliate Asia Motors ''would not be compatible with our strategic needs,'' Alan Perriton, president of G.M. Korea, said in a statement. Kia Motors is being auctioned after collapsing under $10 billion in debts last year.
8/12/1998	Associates First Capital to Buy Textron Unit for $3.9 Billion	The Associates First Capital Corporation, the finance company recently spun off from the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Avco Financial Services for $3.9 billion in cash, accelerating its overseas expansion. The Dallas-based Associates First, which provides credit cards, truck leasing and personal loans, is buying Avco from Textron Inc., which said in June that it was considering selling or spinning off the consumer finance unit to take advantage of recent high prices for finance companies.
8/11/1998	Ford Cutting Average Price On Cars and Trucks 0.3%	The Ford Motor Company announced today that the average price of its 1999 model cars and trucks will decrease three-tenths of 1 percent, or about $61, from comparably equipped 1998 models. It dropped the prices of its highest-volume cars, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, significantly. ''Last year, for the first time in over 30 years, we were able to hold the line on prices; this year is the first time in over 30 years we've actually reduced prices,'' Lloyd Hansen, controller for Ford's marketing and sales operations, said in an interview.
8/5/1998	Ford July Car and Truck Sales Off 4.3% Amid Discount Curb	The Ford Motor Company's domestic car and truck sales fell 4.3 percent in July as lower car sales and a cutback in price discounts offset a modest rise in the demand for trucks. Truck sales rose 5.2 percent from the period a year earlier, to 214,235 vehicles, while car sales fell 16.8 percent, to 128,948. Analysts had expected Ford's sales to be little changed.
8/1/1998	Foreign Affairs; Surfing the Wetlands	I knew this was going to be an interesting interview when Nilson de Barros, superintendent for the environment for Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul state, insisted that we conduct our talk in the middle of the Rio Negro River. I was visiting Mr. de Barros's state, which is at the core of the Pantanal region, along the border between Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. The Pantanal is the largest fresh-water wetland in the world (the size of Wisconsin), and is home to the jaguar and a host of other endangered species. I flew there, on a tiny prop plane, with a team from Conservation International to talk with Mr. de Barros. We rendezvoused at the Fazenda Rio Negro, a ranch and nature lodge on the Rio Negro. Once there, we boarded motorized launches and set off for the meeting point at a shallow bend in the river. The Pantanal nature reserve is Jurassic Park without the dinosaurs. Moving downriver, we passed scores of caimans (relatives of alligators) lounging on shore, giant river otters bobbing up and down, with egrets, hyacinth macaws, toucans, ibises, marsh deer, spoonbills, jaburu storks, ocelots and rheas (relatives of ostriches) all poking out from the forest at different points.
7/16/1998	Ford's Operating Profit Up 6.7%, Beating Expectations	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that its operating profit rose 6.7 percent in the second quarter, easily surpassing Wall Street estimates despite a decline in worldwide car and truck sales. The robust report, however, also included some cautionary notes, including Ford's projection that domestic auto sales were not likely to continue at the strong pace of the second quarter and confirmation that sales in Latin America and Asia were weak. In addition, the company's market share fell in both Europe and North America.
7/16/1998	Ford, while realigning its European strategy, gives Y.& R. some gems and Ogilvy a jolt.	THE Ford Motor Company has unexpectedly shaken up its agency roster across Europe, shifting assignments with billings estimated at $175 million to $225 million to Young & Rubicam Advertising from Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. The Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age described the move yesterday as one of the largest ever in Europe. On Jan. 1, five plum accounts are leaving Ogilvy & Mather Europe in London, part of WPP Group P.L.C., for Young & Rubicam Europe in London, part of Young & Rubicam Inc.
7/14/1998	Tenneco Said To Halt Talks On ITT Unit	Tenneco Inc., a leading maker of car mufflers and shock absorbers, has halted talks to buy the European brakes division of ITT Industries Inc., a person close to the company said late yesterday. Two other bidders, including the German tire maker Continental A.G. and the Ford Motor Company's Visteon Automotive Systems are still interested in the concern and may make an announcement some time this week.
7/14/1998	The Face-Off at G.M.	It began 39 days ago as a simple strike at a single General Motors factory over how modern-day workers should build fenders and hoods. But like two neighborhood toughs daring each other with escalating taunts, G.M. and the United Automobile Workers union have fallen into a dispute so big, complicated and destructive that a solution now seems more elusive than ever. The strike has forced G.M. to lay off 165,000 workers across North America and close 26 of 29 assembly plants. Any hope of resolving it soon was dealt a big setback this weekend when both sides threw up their hands in frustration.
7/7/1998	Car and Truck Sales in U.S. at Highest Rate in 10 Years	The Ford Motor Company yesterday reported a 9.8 percent increase in June car and light-truck sales from June 1997, pushing total United States car and truck sales last month to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 16.7 million, its highest rate in more than 10 years. United States vehicle sales for the month totaled 1,570,355 cars and light trucks, a 14.1 percent increase from June 1997, the best month since September 1986, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, which calculates percentage changes on a daily selling rate. Last month had one more selling day than did June 1997.
7/2/1998	G.M.'s June Sales Soared; Strikes to Hurt July's	The General Motors Corporation said today that June car and truck sales were the highest for any month in nine years but that July sales would plummet because of two strikes that have shut down most of the auto maker's North American assembly plants. Ronald L. Zarrella, vice president in charge of G.M.'s North American Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing Group, said at a news conference today that sales would drop 30 percent to 40 percent this month compared with sales from the month a year earlier because of the strikes by the United Automobile Workers. That would push G.M.'s market share to a record low of 25 percent and put G.M. behind the Ford Motor Company as the largest volume vehicle manufacturer in the United States. Already, analysts say the strikes at two plants in Flint, Mich., have cost G.M. $1.18 billion.
6/24/1998	A 20-Year G.M. Parts Migration To Mexico	In one of General Motors' sprawling auto parts plants in a Matamoros industrial park just south of the Rio Grande, thousands of Mexican workers earn $1 to $2 an hour producing instrument panels and steering wheels for G.M. cars and trucks. Until just a few years ago, United States workers earning close to $22 an hour at G.M.'s Delphi East factory in Flint, Mich., made the instrument panels. And those at a plant to the north in Saginaw produced the steering wheels.
6/19/1998	Big 3 Copy One Another Except in Labor Relations	This city's auto executives have a strong herd instinct, imitating one another's most popular car designs and living in the same neighborhoods, but they could not be more different in their approaches to labor relations as this month's strike against General Motors has shown. Stuck in its 16th strike in the last five years, G.M. has publicly lashed out this week at the United Automobile Workers. By contrast, Ford has not had a strike in 12 years and its executives play golf with U.A.W. leaders. Chrysler's approach lies somewhere in between, with prolonged periods of calm interrupted by occasional strikes that are usually settled behind closed doors with little public acrimony.
6/9/1998	HONDA AND FORD ARE FINED MILLIONS	Honda and Ford have agreed to pay millions of dollars in civil fines for selling cars that were designed to pass emissions tests but run dirtier on the road, Federal prosecutors announced today. The Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency fined the Honda Motor Company $12.6 million for violations of the Clean Air Act. The E.P.A. said the auto maker would also face costs of about $250 million for remedial efforts, including extending warranties and providing free tune-ups for the 1.6 million cars that are affected.
6/4/1998	Vehicle Sales Are Highest Since 1986	The nation's auto industry reported that May was the best month for car and truck sales since September 1986, with sales totaling 1,511,661 cars and trucks, a 12.1 percent increase from the corresponding period last year. Moreover, fueled by hefty price discounts, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles reached 16.3 million cars and trucks last month, the highest level since October 1987.
6/3/1998	Tests Find Light Trucks Pose Hazards to Drivers of Cars	The first round of American crash tests analyzing what happens when light trucks hit cars has found that a Ford Explorer, a mid-size sport utility vehicle, was twice as likely as a mid-size car, mini-van or pickup truck to inflict a critical or severe injury to a car driver's chest and somewhat more likely to hurt a car driver's head and neck, according to test results released at a conference here today. Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which conducted the tests this spring in Ohio, said the results reflected a real-world problem in which sport utility vehicles inflict more damage on cars. But auto industry officials were deeply divided on the value of the tests, with some saying that the tests provided little if any new information and others saying that the tests were only the first steps in what could be a long research program.
6/3/1998	Ford-Mazda Deal For Kia Is Reported	The Ford Motor Company and its Japanese affiliate, the Mazda Motor Corporation, want to form an international consortium to bid for between 49 percent and 51 percent of the Kia Motors Corporation, the chairman of Kia, the bankrupt South Korea auto maker, said yesterday. Yoo Chong Yul, Kia's chairman, said at a news conference that ''Ford is actively showing its interest in taking over Kia'' and that Ford has proposed to form an international consortium. Ford and Mazda jointly own a 16.9 percent stake in Kia.
5/31/1998	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1999 Mercury Cougar; After 8 Lives or So, Mercury's Cat Claws Its Way Back	THE high-style car is suddenly in fashion. Buyers are lining up for the Volkswagen New Beetle, a retro departure from the look-alike wedges and jellybeans that have dominated auto design for a couple of decades. At the Ford Motor Company, the president of automotive operations, Jacques A. Nasser, is asking designers to come up with cars that have more flair and personality. And Ford has moved its Lincoln-Mercury operations to Southern California, so its staff members can stay abreast of youthful West Coast trends. Mercury certainly needs an infusion of new blood. A hot-rodding favorite of the young in the 1950's -- think of James Dean's coupe in ''Rebel Without a Cause'' -- the brand has become stodgy and its buyers are among the industry's oldest.
5/22/1998	Auto Makers Seek to Make Light Trucks Safer in Crashes	Auto makers have quietly begun trying to design sport utility vehicles that will be less dangerous to other motorists. Ford has secretly begun redesigning the suspensions for the Ford Explorer and Expedition, the Mercury Mountaineer, the Lincoln Navigator and future sport utility models so the vehicles will ride as much as several inches lower and be less likely to override cars' bumpers and other safety features during crashes, a Ford manager said. General Motors has designed a prototype for a new Chevrolet Suburban that also rides lower and is test-driving it.
5/21/1998	Ford Posts Financial Results Of Auto Parts Subsidiary	The Ford Motor Company, once a pioneer in making virtually every auto part, disclosed the financial results of its parts operations for the first time today, a move widely seen as a prelude to the possible sale of a stake in the giant division someday. Ford said that the subsidiary, Visteon Automotive Systems, earned $518 million last year on sales of $17.2 billion, roughly in line with analysts' estimates.
5/15/1998	Like a Phoenix, T-Bird Rises Again	TO promote its futuristic, finned 1957 models, Chrysler used the line, ''Suddenly it's 1960.'' Now, as cars like the Volkswagen New Beetle and the Plymouth Prowler street rod take to the streets, it may be time to twist that theme around to, ''Suddenly, it's the 1950's.'' Ford is the latest company to head back to the future, announcing that it will revive the Thunderbird name it retired after the 1997 model year. While the last T-Bird was ungainly and outdated, Ford says the next one will be deliberately retrograde, with ''design cues true to the heritage of the original T-Bird.''
5/12/1998	Papers on a Potential Defect In Ford Cars Are Released	Highway safety officials in Washington released nearly 200 pages of internal documents from the Ford Motor Company yesterday that State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, the large auto insurer, contends back up its assertions that for years the auto maker withheld information about potential fire hazards in millions of vehicles from Federal investigators and customers. State Farm, which is suing Ford to recover claims paid to policyholders because of fires that erupted in ignition switches, said that some documents also detailed how the auto company successfully negotiated to limit the scope of Federal investigations into the fires.
5/8/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Design; Retro Razzle-Dazzle: Chrome Comes Back	FOR a decade or more, bright trim has been in short supply in the auto showroom. Now, like platform shoes being liberated from the back of the closet, chrome is coming back. On the streets and at this year's auto shows, cars and trucks are showing some of their old sparkle. A recent survey by a chrome industry group, the Automotive Bright Products Association, found that many consumers think chrome adds value and luxury to automobiles.
5/8/1998	Mergers Help Fuel a Two-Tier Global Auto Hierarchy	The global auto industry is increasingly divided into two tiers, as a half-dozen giant companies prosper while many of their smaller rivals struggle to manage heavy debts or afford the ever-rising cost of designing new cars. With the pending completion of today's acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz A.G., each of the world's three major auto-producing regions will have two successful, global auto makers. Toyota and Honda are thriving in Japan. General Motors and Ford are enjoying record profits in the United States. Volkswagen and the new DaimlerChrysler, which will have German and American executives but will be dominated by European shareholders, will be the strongest auto makers based in Europe.
5/6/1998	April's Auto Sales Prove Unexpectedly Strong	The auto industry turned in unexpectedly strong April sales results today, the first month this year in which customers bought more cars and trucks than they did during the same period of last year. The sales spurt came as heavy mortgage refinancings in the first quarter of the year gave buyers extra money to spend on monthly car payments while hefty rebates drew them to showrooms.
5/4/1998	Ford is jettisoning its 17-year-old 'quality is job one' tagline for 'Better ideas. Driven by you.'	MOST cars and trucks built today by the Big Three American auto makers are of a high quality -- a big contrast to the 1980's when Japanese brands made Fords, Chryslers and Chevrolets look like junkers. And so the Ford Motor Company has decided it is time to jettison its tagline of the last 17 years, ''Quality is job one.'' In a $40-million-a-year corporate advertising campaign that begins today, Ford introduces its new theme: ''Better ideas. Driven by you.''
5/2/1998	Chrysler Reports 8.2% Sales Jump, As Car Makers Push Big Rebates	In auto dealer showrooms nationwide, rebate skirmishes have given way to an all-out price war, with the Big Three American auto makers promising buyers ever-bigger discounts and even honoring competitors' $1,000-off coupons. The effort to pump up sluggish sales, which had barely gotten under way last month, seems to be working: analysts estimate that auto sales rose 2 to 4 percent in April, and are likely to jump further this month.
5/1/1998	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology; Downshift, Download: Commuting as Work	CARS used to provide a refuge from the corporate office, a place to unwind on the way home. No one knew just where you were, and no one could reach you. Then came cellular telephones, and you could be tracked down as though you were at your desk. The laptop computer and in-car fax machine made it possible for Type A overachievers to work in traffic jams. Soon, if a few new concept vehicles are any indication, you will be receiving and answering E-mail messages, even surfing the Internet, while commuting.
4/26/1998	European Auto Divisions Calling for Improved Fuel Economy	The European operations of Ford and General Motors are supporting a plan by European auto makers to raise the average fuel economy of cars sold in Europe by nearly 20 percent, to 39 miles per gallon, even as the North American operations of both auto makers resist pressures to improve the far worse fuel economy of family vehicles here. The split within the world's two largest auto makers reflects two factors: gasoline taxes and global warming. Fuel economy is more important to car buyers overseas because gasoline in most industrialized nations can cost four times as much as in the United States because of higher taxes. Pressure from environmental regulators to reduce the consumption of gasoline and slow emissions of gases that contribute to global warming is also greater across the Atlantic than in the United States.
4/25/1998	Chrysler Joins Discounts	The Chrysler Corporation matched its rivals Ford and General Motors today by offering discounts of $500 to $1,000 on new-vehicle purchases to millions of owners of its cars and trucks. Ford said on Wednesday that it would offer similar coupons to millions of owners of its models, while General Motors announced its program on April 10. The so-called loyalty coupon discounts are designed to keep owners from defecting to a rival auto maker.
4/19/1998	Big, Brawny Profits	Buyers have been driving brawny sport utility vehicles and pickups out of dealerships as executives here have busily trimmed costs, and as a result the Ford Motor Company reported a 15.1 percent gain in its first-quarter operating profits today. The improvement came even as revenue slipped and as the company spent more on rebates, discounted loans and leases and other incentives to lure buyers to showrooms.
4/17/1998	Ford Has 15% Gain in Profits for Quarter	After years of cranking out low-profit heavy-truck tractors through a maze of conveyor belts and robot welders covering more than 100 acres here, North America's largest auto factory has a new product. And it is beginning to earn a fortune for the Ford Motor Company. When Ford sold its heavy-truck business to Daimler-Benz A.G. last year, the company began building Super Duty pickups here instead. The profitable new pickups, which are taller than Michael Jordan, with front seats that are nearly four feet off the ground, have been an instant hit since they went on sale in February. To keep them selling, and the profits rolling, Ford has brought in a thousand workers from unprofitable car factories in Ohio and has just begun operating the factory here around the clock.
4/16/1998	The Road Ford's Taken; Auto Maker Places Biggest Bet Yet on the Behemoths	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it paid Alex Trotman, its chairman and chief executive, a salary and bonus of $9 million last year, the most it has ever paid its leader and more than double Mr. Trotman's pay in 1996. The record compensation came for a year in which Ford stock rose about 51 percent, surpassing the gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose about 32 percent last year. Mr. Trotman's bonus was also a record at $7 million last year, up from $2.5 million in 1996. His salary rose by $83,333, to $2 million. Including other items like the payment of dividends, a company contribution to a savings plan and the value of options he was awarded last year, Mr. Trotman's compensation for 1997 reached $12.4 million, up from $7.8 million in 1996.
4/15/1998	At Ford, Chairman's Salary and Bonus Double, to $9 Million	WHEN it comes to American-style excess, Lincoln has had its share. And as baby boomers rebelled against the overwrought, softly sprung land yachts of their parents and grandparents, the luxury-car division of Ford faltered. Now, Lincoln is playing catch-up, with some success: Sales are up 63 percent this year, thanks to the popular Navigator sport utility; a new, sleeker Town Car, and a restyled Continental. And for its next act, it wants to slim down, tone up and slip into a sleek European suit.
4/12/1998	There, on the Autobahn, Could It Be a Lincoln?	ONE of the most interesting and entertaining cars I have driven lately is one you cannot buy in the United States: the Ford Puma. Ford began selling the small and very sporty coupe in Europe a year ago. At a price of just over $18,000, the German-made car is aimed at European auto enthusiasts on a modest budget.
4/12/1998	A Horse That Likes a Different Diet	Edsel B. Ford 2d, the son and grandson of the men who built the Ford Motor Company into the world's second-largest auto maker, announced today that he would step down on May 1 from his post as president of Ford's auto lending unit, so as to spend more time helping various civic causes. Ford Motor said that Mr. Ford, who is 49, would become a consultant on marketing issues and would remain on the auto maker's board. He will become a member of the board's organization review and nominating committee, and will remain a member of the board's powerful finance committee, which meets frequently and plays a role in all of the company's major decisions. No successor was named today to replace Mr. Ford as president of the Ford Motor Credit Company. Some industry experts had thought a decade ago that Mr. Ford might someday lead the family company. But it had become increasingly clear in recent years that the Ford family and Ford executives preferred his first cousin, William Clay Ford Jr., who is 40 and has been the chairman of the board's finance committee since 1995. The younger Mr. Ford is expected to become the company's nonexecutive chairman after the current chairman and chief executive, Alex Trotman, retires on Dec. 31, 1999. Jacques Nasser, Ford's highly successful president of worldwide automotive operations, is the leading candidate to replace Mr. Trotman as chief executive. Edsel Ford has become increasingly visible as a philanthropist, following the example of his father, Henry Ford 2d. He is vice chairman of the Salvation Army's national advisory board. Edsel Ford has been Ford Credit's president since 1991. While Ford Credit thrived during the early years of Mr. Ford's management, it has run into problems lately. Ford officials said that Mr. Ford's departure was not linked to the unit's difficulties. ''This is something Edsel has been wrestling with for almost a year, and to make a link with current business conditions is totally inappropriate,'' said Della DiPietro, a Ford Credit spokeswoman.
4/10/1998	A Feisty Cat For Europe	When state officials teamed up with New York City and two private companies to devise financial incentives to sell a new natural-gas-powered taxi, Winner's Garage in Queens did not miss a beat. It bought 100 of the Ford vehicles, replacing its entire fleet. With that purchase, the taxi industry has taken a big step toward accomplishing a major environmental goal for New York City: to begin replacing the city's entire taxi fleet with cleaner vehicles, much the way that transit officials have been changing over the bus fleet.
4/10/1998	Edsel Ford 2d Resigning as Unit President	IN the early years of this century, Henry Ford had a notion that he could sell the same car everywhere in the world, and he was right: Some 15 million Model T's -- built at plants in North and South America, Europe and Japan -- were sold worldwide during that seminal model's 20-year run. But Ford's concept of a simple, low-cost, unchanging car for the masses was relegated to the scrap heap as a wider variety of models emerged from various countries. The one-world, one-car formula no longer worked.
4/9/1998	Edsel Ford 2d To Leave Auto Maker	Edsel B. Ford 2d, the son and grandson of the men who built the Ford Motor Company into the world's second-largest auto maker, has decided to step down from his post as president of Ford's auto lending unit and will not take another executive position. The decision by Mr. Ford, 49, is to be announced on Thursday after Ford's regularly scheduled board meeting. While some industry experts had thought a decade ago that Mr. Ford might someday lead the family company, it had become increasingly clear in recent years that the Ford family and Ford executives preferred his first cousin, William Clay Ford Jr., who is 40. Edsel Ford is still on Ford Motor's board and is likely to stay there as a nonexecutive member.
4/8/1998	Side Air Bags To Be Offered On More Cars	Side air bags will soon be much more common in cars on the American road. The Ford Motor Company, expressing concern about the death rate of people in cars hit from the side, plans to announce on Wednesday that it will offer side air bags on all of its cars and Ford Windstar mini-vans over the next several years, company officials said today.
4/6/1998	Patents; Scientists and engineers working for companies and a university are named inventors of the year.	AFTER having won the race last year to patent a gene thought to predispose women to breast cancer, the scientists responsible were named last week as Inventors of the Year by the Intellectual Property Owners Association. The association, a nonprofit organization for inventors, researchers and businesses, also bestowed the title of Distinguished Inventors on the Ford Motor Company and Princeton University in its annual tribute to patent holders.
3/21/1998	COMPANY BRIEFS	FORD MOTOR CO., Dearborn, Mich., plans to invest $900 million at its plant in Genk, Belgium, in the next three years for the production of new-model Mondeo cars and Transit vans. GROUP 1 AUTOMOTIVE, Houston, an operator of automobile dealerships, completed the acquisition of four dealerships and has signed contracts for 25 more purchases, involving an undisclosed amount of cash and stock.
3/20/1998	FORD AFFILIATE TO BUY 90% OF DAIEI FINANCIAL UNIT	The Associates First Capital Corporation, an affiliate of the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday that it would pay 80 billion yen ($615 million) for 90 percent of DIC Finance, a financial unit of Daiei Inc., Japan's largest supermarket operator. Associates Capital is the most recent foreign company to gain a foothold in Japan before the Government deregulates financial markets. Associates, based in Irving, Tex., will operate DIC Finance as a separate company, keeping its name, management and branch offices, a spokesman said. Associates, which will be spun off from Ford this year, has 429 consumer-finance branches in Japan, 75 of which were added in the fourth quarter of last year.
3/14/1998	FORD SETS DISTRIBUTION FOR ASSOCIATES FIRST SPINOFF	Stockholders of the Ford Motor Company would receive 0.262085 share of the Associates First Capital Corporation for each class B or common Ford share they own as part of the auto maker's spinoff of the consumer-finance company. Ford expects to spin off its 80.7 percent stake in Associates First to shareholders April 7. The total distribution is valued at about $25 billion, including $3 billion in corporate cash given to employees. Ford employee savings plan enrollees would receive the same distribution in cash rather than stock. Ford's shares rose $1.91, to $59.28, while Associates fell 37.5 cents, to $78.9375.
3/6/1998	How Do You Hide an Elephant?	A lawsuit filed yesterday in Federal court in Newark accuses the Ford Motor Company of having profited from the forced labor of thousands of civilians at a truck factory of its German subsidiary during World War II. The suit, which seeks class-action status, contends that profits from the truck factory were retained by Ford's German subsidiary after the war, and asks that this money, along with punitive damages, be distributed to surviving workers.
3/5/1998	Suit Charges Ford Profited By Nazi-Era Forced Labor	Auto sales dipped slightly in the United States last month, as very weak car sales at the General Motors Corporation offset flat or rising sales at other companies, particularly the Chrysler Corporation and the Korean auto makers, which offered big rebates and other deals on small cars. G.M. announced today that its sales fell 7 percent in February from a year earlier, as a 2.5 percent increase in sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans failed to offset a 14.1 percent plunge in car sales. Because G.M. still holds nearly a third of the American auto market -- more than every foreign auto maker combined -- the weak sales at G.M. were enough to drag overall auto sales down by seven-tenths of 1 percent last month.
3/5/1998	Auto Sales Fell In February, Hurt by G.M.	After nearly a year of dismissing concerns that the design of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks poses a threat to the safety of people in cars, the world's two largest auto makers are taking steps to address the problem. The Ford Motor Company has asked its auto parts suppliers for help in redesigning these vehicles, known as light trucks, to make them less dangerous. The General Motors Corporation has stepped up research on the safety of light trucks.
2/21/1998	FORD SETS 2-WEEK LAYOFFS TO CUT BACKLOG OF SMALL CARS	The Ford Motor Company will lay off 3,500 hourly workers at its assembly plant in Wayne, Mich., for two weeks starting on Monday to reduce a backlog of its Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer cars. Ford has a 117-day supply of unsold Escorts and a 103-day supply of Tracers, more than its 72-day target, Jim Bright, a Ford spokesman, said. Sales of small cars have been buffeted as consumers increasingly turn to larger vehicles and trucks. The Detroit-based Ford will display a redesigned Escort next week at the Geneva auto show and will start selling the car in Europe in the fall and in the United States next year.
2/19/1998	Auto Makers to Buy More From Minority-Owned Companies	The Clinton Administration has reached an agreement with the Big Three auto makers to increase their purchases from minority-owned companies by nearly $3 billion by the year 2001, officials from the Administration and the auto makers said today. According to these officials, representatives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler will sign an agreement on Thursday committing the auto makers to increase purchases from minority contractors to 5 percent of total procurement from the current 4.2 percent. The amount of contracts is to increase incrementally over three years starting this year.
2/15/1998	Taurus Hits the Track For First Time at Daytona	The Ford Taurus has long been a practical car built for practical people. But its reputation for practicality will be left behind in a cloud of tire smoke on Sunday when the Taurus makes its Winston Cup debut in the 40th running of the Daytona 500, Nascar's most prestigious race. It's definitely not the Ford you've driven lately.
2/12/1998	Ford Is Considering A Stock Repurchase	The Ford Motor Company's board will consider a stock buyback to buoy its shares after completing the spinoff of its consumer finance unit this quarter, according to its chief financial officer, John Devine. Mr. Devine told analysts at a Salomon Smith Barney auto industry conference in New York today that the world's second-largest auto maker would ponder the move. Speculation of a Ford buyback intensified after the General Motors Corporation announced on Monday a plan to repurchase an additional $4 billion of its shares.
2/5/1998	G.M. and Ford January Sales Fell Sharply	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company announced steep drops in January sales today, with all but the newest-model cars selling slowly. G.M. said its sales fell 6.3 percent last month compared with a year earlier. Its car sales plunged 18.3 percent, but its overall results were lifted by strong sales of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks, whose combined sales rose 10.1 percent last month.
2/5/1998	Big 3 to Make Cleaner Cars Than Required	General Motors, Ford and Chrysler said this evening that they would begin delivering cars next year that emit 70 percent less of some pollutants, in a deal with the Government on Federal pollution standards. Their agreement, which was immediately praised by the Environmental Protection Agency, consummates a deal on smog that has been in the works for most of this decade.
1/28/1998	Ford Reports 4th-Quarter Earnings Surge	Buoyed by cost reductions and strong sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles, the Ford Motor Company reported today that it earned $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 49.2 percent from a year earlier and surprising Wall Street analysts, who had expected a smaller gain. Ford also posted record profits of $6.92 billion for 1997, up 55.6 percent from 1996, while sales rose 4.5 percent last year to $153.63 billion. Ford's profits last year were among the highest ever for any American company. Ford earned $1.45 a share in the fourth quarter and $5.62 a share for the year.
1/28/1998	Auto Dealers Make Changes in Accounts	Ford and Mitsubishi dealers have made changes on their accounts. The Detroit office of J. Walter Thompson, part of WPP Group, was named to handle the account of the New England Ford dealers association, with billings estimated at $25 million.
1/23/1998	New Concern, Few Answers On Ford Fires	A LAWSUIT filed this week by the nation's largest auto insurer raises new concerns for millions of owners of Fords, Mercurys and Lincolns about the possibility that defective ignition switches may cause fires. And while the case raises a number of questions, the owners may find that there are, as yet, few clear answers. In the suit, State Farm Insurance asserted that defective ignition switches installed in 26 million 1983-92 models had caused thousands of fires.
1/23/1998	Ford Is Moving Lincoln-Mercury Headquarters to California	The Ford Motor Company said today that the headquarters of its Lincoln-Mercury division would move to Southern California, marking the first time that a division of one of the Big Three domestic auto makers has moved out of the Detroit area. Robert L. Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales and service, said that the company wanted to understand better the trend-setting California market. Asian auto makers have captured half of the sales there, twice their share of the national market, and most have put the headquarters of their American operations in Southern California.
1/21/1998	State Farm Lawsuit Says Ford Hid Risk Of Fire in Vehicles	State Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, sued the Ford Motor Company yesterday, charging that the auto maker installed defective ignition switches in 26 million cars and then for years has continued to withhold information about the potential fire hazard from Federal officials and customers. The Federal lawsuit, an unusual display of public rancor between the insurance and auto industries, seeks to recover millions of dollars State Farm has paid for fire damage to its customers' cars. The company also hopes to recover deductibles of up to $1,000 absorbed by policyholders.
1/13/1998	Detroit's Big 3 Say Asia Is Forcing Cost Cuts	The Big Three American auto makers might be expected to pop champagne. After all, the stock market has soared, the economic expansion continues, and interest rates have fallen to record lows, all of which would normally lure buyers to showrooms. Instead, Detroit is acting almost as if a recession had hit, hunkering down to shave pennies wherever possible in an effort to cut costs sharply in the face of growing competition from Asia.
1/8/1998	Camry Holds Off Accord For Title of Best-Selling Car	After a race to the wire, the Toyota Camry beat the Honda Accord for the title of the nation's best-selling car in 1997, leaving the Ford Taurus in third place and ending its five-year reign as the top seller. Strong sales in December for Toyota, Honda and the General Motors Corporation left the auto industry as a whole with better-than-expected sales for the year. Auto makers sold 15.2 million vehicles in the United States last year, up from 15.1 million vehicles sold in 1996.
1/7/1998	Hot Truck Sales Make Ford's and Chrysler's Day	Two big American auto makers saw their sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans reach records last month, even as their car sales skidded. The Ford Motor Company said today that its truck sales rose 2.1 percent, to 183,342 in December, a record for the month, compared with the period a year ago. Ford's overall sales fell 3.6 percent, to 299,984 last month, pulled down by weak car sales. Ford sold 116,642 cars, down 11.4 percent from the corresponding period a year ago.
1/7/1998	A Cleaner Family Truck	The Ford Motor Company's decision to reduce smog-causing emissions from its popular and profitable sport utility vehicles and Windstar minivans is a surprising and smart move. These vehicles are considered to be ''light trucks'' under Federal law and are allowed to meet far less stringent pollution standards than cars, even though most are used for family transportation. With light trucks now representing more than 40 percent of passenger vehicles sold, the weaker emissions standards are a serious threat to clean-air goals. Ford will make its 1999 model year sport utility vehicles and Windstars as clean as cars by installing bigger, more effective catalytic converters and improving engine design. These changes do not require new technological discoveries, but will cut polluting gases like nitrogen oxide from those vehicles by as much as 40 percent.
1/6/1998	MOODY'S GIVES FORD MOTOR A NEGATIVE RATINGS OUTLOOK	The ratings outlook for the Ford Motor Company was changed to negative from stable by Moody's Investors Service because of weaker than expected auto markets in Asia and Latin America, increased competition in Europe and North America and the spinoff of Ford's 80.7 percent stake in Associates First Capital, the rating service said. Ford bought the consumer finance business in 1989 for $3.35 billion and sold 19.3 percent of it to the public in 1996. It recently valued its stake in the unit at $18 billion. Last October, Standard & Poor's lowered Ford's corporate credit rating and its senior debt rating because of the pending spinoff.
1/6/1998	AUTO MAKERS PLAN CUTS IN EMISSIONS OF SPORT VEHICLES	The Ford Motor Company announced today that this autumn it would start selling sport utility vehicles and Windstar mini-vans that would produce as little air pollution as cars. The Chrysler Corporation, after initially expressing reservations, said this evening that it would match that move in its most popular sport utility vehicle. Ford said it would install larger and more effective catalytic converters and fine-tune its engines so all of its 1999 model-year sport utility vehicles and Windstars -- nearly a million vehicles -- emit roughly 40 percent less in smog-causing gases like nitrogen oxide than the comparable 1998 models now on the market.
1/3/1998	Camry and Accord Race for Sales Title	The biggest car race of the year was held on dealer lots in December. Who won? It's anyone's guess. With the last sales figures about to trickle in, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord were neck and neck, both vying for the title of the year's best-selling car. Ford's Taurus, a five-time champion, has been demoted to third place.
12/16/1997	Ford Joins in a Global Alliance to Develop Fuel-Cell Auto Engines	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it would invest $420 million (United States) in a global alliance with a German auto manufacturer and a Canadian alternative energy company to develop automotive engines and drive trains that produce power more efficiently and cleanly than today's cars. In making today's announcement, Ford became the latest in a growing list of major automotive companies to back the concept of electric cars that do not need batteries but create their own electricity with a device called a fuel cell.
12/5/1997	Japan Car Deal Pressed by U.S.	The Clinton Administration complained today that Japan was not honoring a 1995 automotive trade agreement and requested intensified efforts by Japan to open its market. Sales in Japan by the Big Three dropped 20 percent during the first nine months of this year, while the pace in adding dealerships there slowed markedly, concluded the Government's task force that monitors compliance.
12/4/1997	Rise in Auto Sales in November Spurred by Demand for Trucks	Auto sales strengthened last month, rising 3.8 percent for the industry as a whole, compared with the similar period a year ago. Strong demand for trucks propelled the sales, which reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.2 million units in November. Sales of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks rose 8.5 percent last month, while car sales slid five-tenths of 1 percent. One reason for the strong results is that auto makers offered generous rebates and discounted finance rates in November.
11/28/1997	America's Top Truck Is Turning 50	THE granddaddy of the modern American pickup truck, the Ford F-Series, will be a half-century old next week. Much has changed since Dec. 3, 1947, when the nation was swept up in postwar optimism and the first F-Series trucks rolled off an assembly line in Atlanta. The 1948 model F-1 -- the smallest, half-ton version of a series that ranged up to the three-ton F-8 -- had chrome trim, boxy fenders and exposed running boards, but they were a big step toward modernity compared with the bulbous trucks they replaced, whose basic design dated to 1938.
11/15/1997	Ford, After Latin Success, Sends 2 to Beef Up Sagging Europe Unit	Seeking to strengthen day-to-day management at the regional level of an important but troubled division, the Ford Motor Company created the positions of president and chief financial officer today at Ford of Europe. The personnel shifts are significant because they represent the latest moves in one of the world's most interesting management experiments at a multinational corporation. The new Ford of Europe president, James D. Donaldson, has been the head of Ford's highly successful light-truck unit, while the chief financial officer, Henry D. G. Wallace, has been the president for the last year of Mazda, the Japanese auto maker in which Ford took a controlling stake a year ago. Mazda announced his departure earlier today in Japan.
11/14/1997	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology and Design; New Writing on the Wall at Ford	IS there a Ford in your future? If so, its styling may already be taking shape in the brain of J. Mays, a fast-rising designer who recently took the top design job at the Ford Motor Company. In addition to supervising a staff of 1,000 designers in seven studios around the world, Mr. Mays -- his given name is the letter ''J'' -- will be working to make Ford's five brands look distinct while preserving a hint of family resemblance among the 62 car and truck models the company builds worldwide with the nameplates of Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Jaguar and Aston Martin.
11/14/1997	First Foreigner to Lead Japanese Company Retires	The Mazda Motors Corporation said today that Henry D. G. Wallace, the first gaijin, or foreigner, to head a Japanese company, was retiring. The departure of Mr. Wallace, who was Mazda's president, comes just a little more than a year after he was appointed to lead the ailing car manufacturer through a corporate overhaul.
11/14/1997	Brazilian Slowdown Forces Rethinking and Retrenching	Southeast Asian auto sales have collapsed, and now the other shoe has dropped for the world's biggest auto makers. After years of spectacular growth, the Brazilian auto market -- the largest of any emerging-market country -- is facing a severe slowdown as the Government there has doubled interest rates, raised income taxes and slashed spending to prevent Asia's currency turmoil from spreading across the Pacific.
11/14/1997	Looking at Cars Through a Critical Eye	As J. Mays takes Ford's top design job, his best-known work, the Volkswagen Concept One, above, is coming to market as a reborn VW Beetle. A critic of backward-looking styling, the outspoken Mr. Mays describes the Concept One as ''very modern.'' Here are some of his other picks and pans in auto design. DISLIKES
11/12/1997	SMART CHOICE TO ACQUIRE 2 FORD DEALERSHIPS IN FLORIDA	Smart Choice Automotive Group Inc. said it had agreed to acquire two Ford dealerships in east-central Florida. Terms were not disclosed. One, Bill Redditt Ford in Stuart, has annual revenues of about $38 million. The other, Warren Wooten Ford in Cocoa, has about $61 million in annual revenues. It is the second-oldest Ford dealership in Florida and one of the oldest in the United States, the company said. Smart Choice, a new- and used-car dealership operator based in Titusville, Fla.,, had revenues of $22.9 million for the first six months of 1997.
11/11/1997	Big changes are afoot in the multimillion-dollar blue-chip accounts of Nike, I.B.M. and Ford.	NIKE, I.B.M. and Ford are joining a lengthening list of advertisers taking a second look at plans for big blue-chip accounts. The most surprising development was an acknowledgment yesterday by Nike Inc. that it was seeking ideas to build its flagship Nike brand from another agency in addition to Wieden & Kennedy, the Portland, Ore., shop responsible for the campaigns carrying the familiar ''Just do it'' theme. Nike spends about $250 million annually on advertising.
11/5/1997	Auto Makers Report Weak October Sales	The Big Three American auto makers reported weak sales in October, giving the industry a slow start in the first month of the new model year. The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 4 percent last month compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, mostly because of weak sales of vans, small sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales dropped 2.1 percent last month, as a sharp drop in mini-van sales outweighed rising sales of large sport utility vehicles like the Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator. The Chrysler Corporation announced on Monday that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October.
11/5/1997	Auto Giants Build a Glut of Asian Plants, Just as Demand Falls	Shoppers have deserted car dealerships across Southeast Asia since the region's currency crisis began last summer, while investors who have lost fortunes in plummeting stock markets have flooded the used-car market with late-model luxury cars. The world's auto giants do not seem to care. Even though some industry experts insist they should pull back, General Motors and Ford Motor are busy building huge new assembly plants in Thailand and preparing to open up to five more factories in Southeast Asia and China. And Toyota and Honda are dealing with the crisis with temporary production cutbacks rather than changing their basic strategic plans.
11/4/1997	October Auto Sales Weak Except for Newest Designs	People shopping for a new car last month were ready to plunk down money for the hottest new or redesigned models, leaving auto makers with lackluster sales for all but the freshest designs. The Chrysler Corporation said today that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October, the first month of the new model year. But its newest sport utility vehicle, the brawny Dodge Durango, sold briskly, as did its new four-door version of the Dodge Ram pickup truck.
10/30/1997	Two commercials, meant only for Connecticut, run nationally and win praise for a small agency.	A SMALL agency is getting a big break as two of its commercials, originally intended to appear only in Connecticut, were seen nationally by the viewers of last night's episode of the CBS sitcom ''Murphy Brown.'' The agency, Cronin & Company, produced the two 30-second spots on behalf of a client, the Connecticut Department of Public Health, to promote a program encouraging women, especially those ages 40 and older, to get cancer examinations. The commercials, moving in their simplicity, urge women to ''care enough to care for yourself'' by asserting that their children, spouses, siblings and parents are victims along with the cancer patients.
10/28/1997	Owner of Rolls-Royce Plans Sale of Luxury Auto Maker	Rolls-Royce Motor Cars P.L.C., a quintessentially British emblem of quality craftsmanship, purring performance and class, was put up for sale today and will almost certainly pass into foreign hands. Vickers P.L.C., the military and engineering group that is the corporate parent of Rolls-Royce, said it was selling the subsidiary to concentrate on what its chairman, Sir Colin Chandler, identified as its core businesses of armored vehicle and propulsion technology products. Sir Colin said a growing number of possible suitors had expressed interest in Rolls-Royce, but he did not identify any.
10/24/1997	At Toyota, 10% Share Is Viewed As a Start	HIROSHI OKUDA is talking ''Global 10'' again, which means trouble for the world's auto manufacturers. Global 10 was the 1980's battle cry of the Toyota Motor Corporation, which aimed for a 10 percent share of the global market. But in the early 90's, as trade tensions with the United States flared and Toyota floundered, the slogan was quietly abandoned. Now, however, Japan's largest and most powerful auto company is out to gain market share again. And spearheading the drive is Mr. Okuda, the blunt-talking judo black belt who became president two years ago.
10/16/1997	Profits Rise Sharply at Ford On Strong Sales	The Ford Motor Company reported sharply higher third-quarter earnings today, as improved results in Europe and South America and strong sales of big sport utility vehicles more than offset weaker car loan profits and big discounts on car sales. Ford earned $1.13 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the third quarter, beating analysts' expectations of 83 cents a share; it was Ford's best showing ever in the third quarter, traditionally the weakest period in the American auto industry. Profits were up 64 percent from a year earlier, when Ford earned $686 million, or 56 cents a share. Third-quarter sales rose to $36.10 billion from $33.96 billion the year before.
10/10/1997	Toyota Seizes a Title, but Ford's Trucks Stay in the Money	The 1997 model year is officially over, and there is a new name at the top of the list of the best-selling cars: the Toyota Camry. The Camry took the title from the Ford Taurus, which had been the top-selling car in America for the prior four years, having stolen the crown from the Honda Accord. But the race is already on for the 1998 model year, and Honda has its eyes on the prize again with a redesigned Accord that recently went on sale. This past year, even with an aging design, the Accord came close to knocking the Taurus down to third place, with Honda selling just 1,696 fewer Accords.
10/9/1997	Ford Planning To Spin Off Lending Unit	Seeking to persuade investors that its stock is undervalued, the Ford Motor Company said late today that it would distribute to shareholders its 80.7 percent stake in its highly profitable consumer and commercial lending unit, handing out shares in the Associates First Capital Corporation worth nearly $18 billion. Ford executives have long contended that the stock market has failed to account for the auto maker's valuable financial businesses in allowing Ford stock to trade at a price-to-earnings ratio just half that of the overall market. The nearly $18 billion in Associates shares to be spun off now represent a third of Ford's market value of $57.6 billion, yet Ford's earnings from its stake in the Associates made up just 7.8 percent of its second-quarter profits.
10/7/1997	Joint Venture Forms To Market Jaguar	Jaguar Cars Inc., the luxury-car maker owned by the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday that the lead Jaguar agencies -- Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and the J. Walter Thompson Company -- would form a joint venture to handle the worldwide Jaguar marketing account, with combined billings estimated at $50 million to $60 million. Ogilvy has handled Jaguar in North America and Thompson has handled the brand in markets like Europe. The sharing of Ford business is not uncommon for the two agencies, both owned by WPP Group.
10/4/1997	Auto Sales Weaken as Buyers Await Deals	Call it the car buyer's revenge. Auto sales slowed in September, and as a result auto makers are expected to announce a new round of rebates and discounted lease deals as they vigorously try to woo more buyers into showrooms.
10/3/1997	Car Makers Voice Complaints About Limiting Gas Emissions	President Clinton met this evening with the chief executives of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler to promote his trade policies, but received instead an earful of complaints about the Administration's interest in limiting emissions of gases that may contribute to global warming. The White House held the meeting the day after threatening South Korea with trade sanctions if it did not remove auto import limits. But the auto executives were more worried about the Administration's stance on global warming for a United Nations conference in December, and took the opportunity this evening to tell the President just what they thought.
10/3/1997	FORD SAYS IT PLANS $1 BILLION FACTORY IN BRAZIL	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it planned to spend up to $1 billion to build a factory in southern Brazil, at the heart of the fast-growing Mercosur free trade area. The new plant will produce 100,000 units of a yet-to-be-identified model by 2001, Ford said. The investment brings to at least $3 billion the amount Ford plans to spend in Brazil between 1995 and 2000 to improve its lagging market share amid a regional boom in car sales there. The company's immediate goal is to sell up to 30 percent of the plant's output to neighboring Mercosur countries -- Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay -- and the rest in Brazil. Ford's stock was up $1.1875 at $46.8125.
9/28/1997	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mercury Grand Marquis; Rear Drive but Refusing to Retire: A Case of Modern Maturity	MY first thought as I slid behind the wheel of a tan Mercury Grand Marquis: ''Detroit sure doesn't make cars like this anymore.'' But it does. The front bench seat, split into two sections, is as long and supple as a sofa. One's legs stretch out in a space that is deep and wide, and the top of the dashboard, which swoops from pillar to pillar, has the look of a surfboard. Up front is a powerful V8 and in the back, the traditional gearing for rear-wheel drive. My second thought: ''Does anybody buy these?'' Sure, the Grand Marquis is commonly used by car services in New York City and its similar sibling, the Ford Crown Victoria, is ubiquitous as a taxi. Police departments around the country snap up the Crown Vic, too. But do hard-working Americans, faced with an array of four-wheel-drive sport utilities, snazzy front-drive sedans and smart neo-luxury cars, sign the papers to drive away in what amounts to an updated version of a family car of the 1960's?
9/10/1997	High-End New Homes For High-End New Cars	On 11th Avenue, Manhattan's Automobile Row, the currency is leg room, not square footage; chrome, not granite. But two big renovation projects are hard to ignore, even from a speeding automobile. And that is just the point. The Ford Motor Company has just spent $73 million to buy and rebuild a historic industrial building at 787 11th Avenue, between 54th and 55th Streets, as the new home of Manhattan Ford/Lincoln-Mercury/Jaguar. The dealership moved out of leased space at 555 West 57th Street.
9/10/1997	Ford Parts Unit Is Given a Name	The Ford Motor Company has renamed its parts-making subsidiary Visteon, establishing a identity intended to help the unit attract outside customers. Ford combined several units last fall to create the Automotive Parts Operation as a separate profit center, making instrument panels, climate-control systems, windshields, fuel systems, wiper motors, axles, transmissions
9/6/1997	Lawsuit Asserts Ford Knowingly Installed Defective Mechanism in Millions of Vehicles	Despite safety concerns about millions of its cars and light trucks, the Ford Motor Company withheld information from Federal regulators about an engineering defect that can cause the vehicles to stall at high speeds, documents filed in a lawsuit here suggest. A former senior official of the Federal agency charged with monitoring automotive safety described the case as the most serious example he had ever seen of a manufacturer's failure to produce internal documents at the request of Government investigators.
9/5/1997	August Auto Sales Kept Up Strong Pace	For the second consecutive month, buyers flocked to car dealerships in August, giving the auto industry stronger-than-expected summer sales. The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales in August rose 3.6 percent, helping the industry as a whole register a sales increase of 5 percent from a year earlier. On Wednesday, the General Motors Corporation reported strong sales, while other auto makers posted mixed results.
8/30/1997	Buick Bringing Its Rivals to the Showroom Floor	It sounds like a cruel challenge: Why not put Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords in Buick dealerships and see whether dealers can persuade people to buy the Buicks anyway? Even executives at Buick's parent company, the General Motors Corporation, thought the idea was a joke at first. After all, Camrys and Accords are synonymous with high quality and reliability to the generation of buyers who normally would not be caught dead in a Buick showroom. To baby boomers, Buicks are synonymous with mushy steering, velour-covered bench seats and room for six.
8/29/1997	Indianapolis Dealer Objects to Ford Plan	The Ford Motor Company's plan to streamline its Indianapolis dealerships has suffered a setback because a key dealer rejected the company's buyout offer as inadequate. Ford said in May that it would test possible nationwide dealership changes in Indianapolis. Under the plan, the city's 18 Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships would be consolidated into four or five large stores. Ford would share ownership with existing dealers, one of whom would manage the entire chain.
8/14/1997	For 1998, New-Car Prices Barely Budge	Nearly every autumn, auto makers could be counted on to roll out next year's models, and nearly every autumn they raised prices. Not this year.
8/8/1997	Ford to Sell Its Stake in British Venture	Siemens A.G. said today that it would buy the Ford Motor Company's 49 percent stake in their British car-components venture, Siemens Automotive Systems Ltd., for an undisclosed price. Siemens Automotive Systems, which Ford said employs 400 people at a plant in Telford, England, assembles intake manifolds and other engine parts for car makers. Ford and Jaguar are its biggest customers.
8/6/1997	U.S. Sales at Ford Rose 5.1% In July, Outpacing Estimates	The Ford Motor Company said today that its United States sales rose more than expected in July, led by continued gains by its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company's overall sales rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier; analysts had expected sales to rise about 1 to 2 percent. Ford said domestic car sales fell 5.3 percent, to 153,407, while sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans rose 14.9 percent, to 200,342.
8/3/1997	Looking at the New Face of the Cougar	THE Ford Motor Company has taken the wraps off a new concept car, the Mercury MC2, that strongly hints at the next-generation Mercury Cougar. The slow-selling current version of the Cougar has been losing money and will go out of production later this month, leaving the auto maker without the venerable nameplate for the first time in 30 years.
8/2/1997	Ford Offers Workers Bonus to Relocate	The Ford Motor Company said today that it was offering workers who are scheduled to be laid off from its car-assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio, bonuses of as much as $45,000 if they agree to move to a truck plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford plans to close the Lorain unit in September, idling 1,564 auto workers. The plant has been making Thunderbird and Cougar cars, which are being temporarily discontinued.
7/30/1997	Ford to Rejuvenate Dying Mercury Cougar	The Ford Motor Company announced plans today to rejuvenate its tired Mercury division by reviving Mercury's oldest nameplate. The Mercury Cougar, introduced as a flashy sports coupe 30 years ago, has over that time put on the love handles of a gentle-riding large car. Earlier this year, Ford said that it would halt the Cougar's assembly line this summer because it was selling so slowly.
7/24/1997	A Turcotingo by Any Other Name . . .	To the Editor: While I enjoyed reading your paean to the Edsel (news article, July 22), I am disappointed you didn't mention that the Ford Motor Company enlisted the services of one of America's foremost poets in its quest for a suitably appealing name for the much-maligned automobile. For more than a year before the Edsel's unveiling, the Pulitzer-winning poet Marianne Moore submitted dozens of fanciful coinages for the new Ford vehicle, drawing them from sources as diverse as mythology, exotic birds, rare plant taxonomies and obscure historical allusions.
7/24/1997	A Turcotingo by Any Other Name . . .	To the Editor: Edsel owners may boast about its speedometer warning signal (''The Edsel, With All Its Quirks, Is Hailed as It Turns 40,'' news article, July 22), but credit for that idea may actually go to the Chrysler Corporation. For 1939, Chrysler introduced a speedometer needle that changed colors as the car accelerated in nighttime driving.
7/22/1997	The Edsel, With All Its Quirks, Is Hailed as It Turns 40	Ted Girvan would not let anyone else drive his: the muffler is loose. Richard Jump worried about how much gas was left in his: the fuel gauge is broken. Bruce Paterson finally got the passenger-side door on his to stay shut: it did not close on the first try. Or the second, the third or the fourth. ''It takes a special finesse to close the door on an Edsel,'' Mr. Paterson said.
7/17/1997	Large Vehicles Lift Profits at G.M. and Ford	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company announced better-than-expected second-quarter earnings today, profiting from lower costs and America's seemingly boundless appetite for huge sport utility vehicles and big pickups. Financial analysts said that the mammoth Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle had emerged as the industry's most profitable model. Jack V. Kirnan at Salomon Brothers estimated that Ford earned $14,000 in pretax profits on each $30,000 Expedition, excluding vehicle design and engineering costs, amounting to $1.05 billion in the second quarter.
7/13/1997	A Fast-Acting Testosterone Booster	HOW can you tell if a new car has scored a direct hit on its intended market? One reliable barometer, I have found, is the attention a car receives during a test drive. If a new model provokes plenty of unsolicited, favorable comments, it is likely to be a success. And the comments I heard during a week I recently spent driving a 1998 Ford SVT Contour suggest that the Ford Motor Company is on target with this new limited-edition, high-performance Euro-style sedan.
7/13/1997	Personal Training at Ford's Gym	IT is a balancing act faced by many auto makers: how to create exciting cars that appeal to the small but influential group of hard-core enthusiasts without detracting from their main mission, selling large numbers of mainstream vehicles that generate the bulk of corporate earnings? Mercedes-Benz has long used AMG, a company that customizes and energizes production cars, to produce high-performance models; BMW has its ''M'' racing division, which turns out models like the hot M3. Other so-called ''tuner'' companies create special versions of production vehicles like the 40th-anniversary Chevrolet Camaro SS, modified by SLP Engineering in the Detroit area, and the Saleen Mustang, done by Saleen Performance in California.
7/8/1997	Ford's Ka Model Headed to Japan	The Ford Motor Company said today that it planned to introduce Japan to the right-hand-drive version of the Ka compact car, a successful European-market model that the United States auto maker first wheeled out late last year. A Ford spokeswoman in Tokyo said the introduction of the model was expected to take place some time in the next two years, although details had not been made final. Ford builds the Ka at its Spanish plant.
7/6/1997	As Mail Jeep Fades Out, The Mini-Van Moves In	The ubiquitous postal Jeep, a rugged American icon for nearly 30 years, is slowly disappearing, to be replaced by another, tamer icon, the mini-van. The Postal Service is taking delivery this summer of 9,000 Ford Windstars, to replace a roughly equal number of Jeeps. As with the passing of drive-in movies and waitresses on roller skates, the fading of the Jeep and the switch to vans is another sign of broader changes in American society and the workplace.
7/4/1997	Ford Might Build New Asia Plant	The Ford Motor Company and its Japanese affiliate, the Mazda Motor Corporation, may set up a new Asian auto plant, expanding their production in the region, company officials said today. ''We are looking into a variety of joint business opportunities with Ford, including manufacturing ventures'' in Asia outside Japan, said Masahiro Akutagawa, a Mazda spokesman.
7/4/1997	Ford Posted 4.7% Sales Rise In June in Contrast to Rivals	The Ford Motor Company said today that its United States domestic car and truck sales rose 4.7 percent in June, helped by rebates and other incentives, providing a bright spot in one of the auto industry's worst sales months of 1997. The last of the auto makers to report, Ford said car sales rose 4.2 percent from June 1996, to 160,945, while pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-van sales rose 5.2 percent, to 196,796.
6/22/1997	A 2-Door for Buyers At the Entry Level	ABOUT a year ago, the clerk at a service station was admiring the handsome European sedan I was driving, the brand of which I no longer recall. ''But, I like coupes,'' said the middle-aged woman, ''I just can't bring myself to buy a four-door. They're for old people.''
6/21/1997	Camry Teaches Economics 101: Features Are Nice but Price Sells	Auto advertisers love to promote each new model as changing an industry, but only a few actually do so, like the 1986 Ford Taurus, which spawned a fleet of aerodynamic imitators. Introduced last autumn, the 1997 Toyota Camry lacks the grace or beauty to alter automotive design -- indeed, its bland curves verge on the utilitarian. But the car is reshaping the nation's midsize car market because of its price tag of $16,448 to $24,088, down $550 to $1,745 from the 1996 model, depending on the version. The lower prices have narrowed substantially, without eliminating, the premium that American buyers have come to pay for a Japanese car compared with a similarly equipped American model.
6/17/1997	Start Expanding That Garage For Detroit's Next Generation	Big is getting bigger on the American road. American car makers, inspired by the recent popularity of big cars and trucks, are planning even larger models with equally gigantic sticker prices. Take the behemoth being tested by the Ford Motor Company, which, at 19 feet, would dethrone the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban by a foot as the longest mass-produced family vehicle ever built.
6/15/1997	The Return of Detroit's 'Low Priced Three'	DID somebody say ''value''? With auto makers from Hyundai to Mercedes repeating that word like a mantra, its definition has grown fuzzy. But for many new-car shoppers of limited means, a good value means the biggest car for the money. The three brands represented on this page, Chevrolet, Ford and Plymouth, were conceived as purveyors of high-value transportation, and they filled that role neatly for decades. Well into the 1960's they were the ''Low Priced Three,'' the first rung up the automotive ladder for working people who wanted a roomy, reliable, economical car, with perhaps a little style thrown in. Over time, the three broadened their offerings and blurred that image, which brand-driven marketers are now trying to reclaim.
6/15/1997	Sticker Shock	CAR A Drama of the American Workplace. By Mary Walton. Illustrated. 360 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95.
6/10/1997	Ford Paying Dealers to Buy Cars Coming Off Lease	Seeking to prevent a growing number of cars coming off lease from further depressing used-car prices, the Ford Motor Company has begun to pay dealers to buy these vehicles instead of returning them to the auto maker for sale at auction. Ford is not the first auto maker this year to try to buttress used-car prices -- the Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. started a program in January that puts pressure on dealers to buy off-lease vehicles. But Ford's new program, quietly begun on May 1 and scheduled to last at least until June 30, is the most ambitious effort yet to stem problems in the used-car market.
6/8/1997	Cars for Ethanol	Ford and Chrysler have found a way to do well by seeming to do good. The auto makers plan to build hundreds of thousands of vehicles that can burn ethanol, gasoline or a blend of both. Ethanol, a type of alcohol often made from corn, is predictably popular with farmers, who promote its use as reducing oil imports.
6/5/1997	Ford Sales Off as Industry Endures a Dismal Spring	For the auto industry, the spring selling season was as damp and cold as the weather across most of the country. The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales dropped 3 percent in May as the auto industry reported its second consecutive lackluster sales month. May's auto sales were well below their levels during the corresponding period a year ago, when buyers were snapping up new cars and trucks.
6/4/1997	Ford Pushes an Ethanol Line, But Gas-Guzzlers Profit, Too	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it would begin building 250,000 cars, mini-vans and pickup trucks annually that can burn ethanol or gasoline, in the largest alternative fuel program in the United States since the oil crises of the 1970's produced alarm about American reliance on imported energy. Chrysler is expected to announce a similar program next week, ethanol and auto industry officials said. General Motors is considering whether to follow Ford and Chrysler's example.
5/24/1997	Mazda Shows Improvement Under Ford's Leadership	The Mazda Motor Corporation, in a sign of partial recovery, said today that unconsolidated net profit soared in its first fiscal year under the control of the Ford Motor Company, although it still had an operating loss. The net profit came partly from the sale of securities. Moreover, the results announced today, for the year ended March 31, were for the parent company only.
5/23/1997	Taking Ford Taurus Into the Next Century	The Ford Motor Company recently entered the field of high-mileage, low-emissions cars when it announced that it planned to develop and test the P2000 family of high-technology, midsize vehicles. Ford's goal is to achieve three times the fuel efficiency of a current Ford Taurus, which has a city fuel economy rating of 20 miles a gallon and a highway rating of 27 miles a gallon.
5/19/1997	Thompson Chicago Quits Midas Account	J. Walter Thompson Chicago will resign the national advertising account of the Midas International Corporation, effective Aug. 15, citing a conflict with its important Ford Motor Company account. Thompson Chicago has handled the Midas account, with billings estimated at $25 million, since October 1995. Ford's plans to ''open satellite service centers will put Ford and Midas on a head-to-head collision course,'' said John Clinton, executive vice president and general manager at Thompson Chicago, a unit of the WPP Group. ''Given J. Walter Thompson's long-standing relationship with Ford and its dealer groups, we've decided we must discontinue our relationship with Midas.''
5/16/1997	After Latin Venture Fails, VW Succeeds And Ford Scrambles	Supported by concrete posts and topped with five lines of barbed wire, the six-foot-high chain-link fence zigzags through the heart of what used to be a blossoming auto-making partnership here. On one side of the fence are the operations of the Ford Motor Company, on the other side those of Volkswagen A.G., now divided by a nasty corporate divorce -- a case study of the difficulties in breaking up a big-company joint venture. The basic mistake of Ford, its officials now acknowledge, lay in assuming that a marriage made in the late 1980's would last indefinitely. The union looked good on paper: the companies would make cars together for Brazil and Argentina, sharing all the profits and producing no competing models.
5/12/1997	How to get persnickety enzymes to do all those things that researchers want them to do.	Researchers have struggled for the last 30 years to harness for industrial and medical uses some of the 5,000 known enzymes, which act as miniature chemists by setting off chemical reactions. But because enzymes are so temperamental, this quest has proved difficult. Last month, Altus Biologics, of Cambridge, Mass., was awarded a patent for a method of crystallizing enzymes that the company contends will unleash the substances' commercial potential to do everything from enhancing laundry detergents to neutralizing chemical weapons.
5/9/1997	FORD AND LENDER REVIEW MINORITY CHARGES	The Ford Motor Company and the Associates First Capital Corporation, a consumer and commercial lending company 80.3 percent owned by Ford, are reviewing allegations that Associates took advantage of borrowers who were poorly educated or from low-income or minority groups, Ford's chairman, Alex Trotman, said yesterday at a news conference after the Ford shareholders annual meeting. He added that executives and outside directors of Associates were conducting the review with Ford officials. It should be completed within two weeks, and the two companies will decide then whether any action is warranted, Mr. Trotman said, adding that Ford and Associates frequently review their business practices. Mr. Trotman acknowledged that isolated instances of unethical conduct might have taken place, but he expressed strong doubt that any large-scale problem existed.
5/8/1997	The 800-pound gorilla among advertisers, the auto industry, gained a little more weight in 1996.	AUTO makers, traditionally the nation's largest advertisers, nailed down the industry's premier position even more securely last year by raising their ad spending 9.4 percent over 1995. Indeed, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU N.V. that tracks advertising expenditures, the auto industry as a whole spent $11.6 billion on advertising last year, or more than 17 percent of the $66.7 billion that the nation's advertisers spent. And the spending figures for auto companies do not include advertising paid for by local auto dealers.
5/6/1997	Ford Sales Fell 4.3% in April as Big 3 Lost Share to Foreign Makers	The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales dropped 4.3 percent last month, as the Big Three American auto makers lost ground to Japanese auto makers that benefited from favorable exchange rates. The Big Three sold 73.3 percent of the cars and trucks purchased in the United States in April, down 2.1 percentage points from April 1996. Their loss was mostly Japanese auto makers' gain: they picked up 1.2 percentage points of market share, while German auto makers gained another seven-tenths of a percentage point.
5/4/1997	The Last of the T-Birds (Maybe)	IT says a lot about the latest -- and possibly the last -- Ford Thunderbird that the '97 model seems old, even to a retro sort of guy like me. In fact, my first thought when I laid eyes on the bright red test car was that it would be a great candidate for hot-rodding and customizing, maybe for a real set of dual exhausts and good-sounding mufflers, maybe for some tricks with the sheet metal, maybe for some truly flashy paint.
5/4/1997	4 Decades of Thunderbird Heaven	JIM CAPPUZZO JR. is 32 years old, two years younger than his favorite automobile, the 1963 Ford Thunderbird. He has six of the 1963 models, some quite rare, and he just plain loves T-Birds. So it seems odd when he reacts in fairly ho-hum manner to the Ford Motor Company's recent decision to kill the Thunderbird, one of the great names in classic American metal. The move was ''not really so odd,'' says Mr. Cappuzzo, a Morganville, N.J., businessman. ''In fact, I think it's a super decision. I will say that some of the guys in our organization were upset. They were going to write letters to try to get Ford to change its mind. But I pointed out that today's Birds are not the cars that we collect.''
4/26/1997	HERTZ STOCK RISES 15% ON FIRST DAY OF TRADING	Shares of the Hertz Corporation, the car rental unit of the Ford Motor Company, rose 15 percent above their offering price in their first day of trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts credited the performance to Hertz's name recognition and the quality of the investment firm that managed the offering, J. P. Morgan Securities. More than $480 million was raised on the sale of 20.01 million shares late Thursday at $24 apiece, at the high end of the expected price range. The stock closed yesterday at $27.625. The sale of 20 million shares by Ford represented a 19 percent stake. Ford became sole owner of Hertz in 1994 after having bought a stake in the company in 1987.
4/25/1997	Hot Markets Are Producing Cars For Domestic Buyers and Export	SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, Brazil
4/24/1997	Marketers from Ford to La-Z-Boy are hit by a computer-aided outbreak of anthropomorphism.	EVER since Babe the pig started talking in August 1995, animals all over seem to have something to say. Of course, animals in the media have talked since before Francis the Talking Mule ever opened his trap, and that was 1950. But recent work in mainstream advertising has shown animals whose bodies and mouths move in convincingly human-like ways.
4/23/1997	Ford Consolidates Its Media Account	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it had consolidated its national media buying account, with billings estimated at more than $700 million, at a new subsidiary in Detroit being set up by a longtime Ford agency, J. Walter Thompson U.S.A. The media buying part of Ford Motor's account, which covers five divisions besides Ford, including Lincoln-Mercury, Mazda Motors of America and Jaguar North America, had been handled by three agencies in addition to Thompson Detroit, which handles the Ford division. The other agencies are: Foote, Cone & Belding in Los Angeles, a unit of True North Communications, which handled media buys for Mazda; Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York and Detroit, a unit of WPP Group, which handled Jaguar, Ford customer service and the Ford corporate media buys, and Young & Rubicam Inc. in Detroit, which handled the Lincoln-Mercury media buying.
4/22/1997	Ford Plans Zero-Emission Fuel Cell Car	The Ford Motor Company plans to build a prototype electric car that gets its power from a fuel cell rather than from batteries, the company and the Energy Department said today. The car will carry compressed hydrogen gas, which the fuel cell will mix with oxygen from the air to make water in a low-temperature chemical reaction that also gives off electric current. The car would probably have the energy supply to travel many more miles than electric cars that run on chemical batteries, according to experts, and could refuel quickly. Ford said the car could be ready for evaluation by 2000.
4/18/1997	Ford and Mazda Agree to Increase Sharing	The Ford Motor Company and the Mazda Motor Corporation have agreed on a plan for a ''substantial amount of sharing'' of basic designs, engines and transmissions in an effort to cut costs, Mazda's president, Henry D. G. Wallace, said today. Ford effectively took control of Mazda a year ago, and Mr. Wallace said that the ''enhanced strategic relationship'' between the two companies was going swimmingly.
4/17/1997	Ford Reports Its Quarterly Profit Jumped	The Ford Motor Company delighted Wall Street today by reporting first-quarter profits far higher than analysts thought possible. Ford earned $1.47 billion in the first quarter, or $1.20 a share -- surpassing analysts' forecasts by more than 30 cents a share and more than doubling its results of a year earlier, when the company earned $653 million, or 53 cents a share.
4/11/1997	Auto Makers Draw a Yawn On Wall Street	The Big Three auto makers have been showing signs of renewed strength this month, but to Wall Street the industry seems to have reached a plateau. Even two bullish announcements today -- that the Chrysler Corporation had better-than-expected profits in the first quarter and that the Ford Motor Company would increase its dividend -- left analysts talking about auto stocks mostly as a safe bet if the stock market nose dives. But the collective yawn from the market -- shares in General Motors and Chrysler were unchanged today while Ford's stock slid modestly -- comes for three very distinct reasons, according to analysts: Chrysler is such a well-managed company that it cannot get much better; Ford's stock has done so badly that it cannot get much worse, and there is light at the end of a lengthy tunnel for G.M.'s turnaround efforts.
4/4/1997	Vehicle Sales In March Highest In Eight Years	Despite a decline at the Ford Motor Company, March car and truck sales were the strongest in at least eight years, getting the spring selling season off to a robust start. Ford, the last of the Big Three American auto makers to report, said today that its sales fell 2.6 percent in March from a year earlier, when its sales were strong. But over all, cars and trucks were whisked out of dealerships at the brisk, seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.8 million vehicles in March. Auto makers sold 1.4 million vehicles last month, up 1.5 percent from the corresponding period a year ago, when sales were also strong.
4/2/1997	Ford and Mazda To Share Underbodies	After months of negotiations, the Ford Motor Company and its Japanese affiliate, the Mazda Motor Corporation, have agreed to make at least two car models using common underbodies, a Mazda spokesman said yesterday. An underbody, which is the steel platform to which the body of the car is welded, includes the engine, transmission, floor panel and suspension.
3/23/1997	The Wrong Generation's Fun	Generations have loved the Ford Thunderbird. It came on the scene with a splash in Detroit's postwar glory years, and found more fame after the Beach Boys sang, ''She'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away.''
3/23/1997	Auto Stocks: Beneath the Metallic Glow	RESENTED with the prospect of buying something for nearly nothing, investors might pull out their wallets or they might fret that their pockets are about to be picked. When it comes to investing in the auto makers, fretting seems to carry the day. For more than a decade, various Wall Street analysts have periodically suggested that investors could get something for nothing by buying the Big Three auto makers' low-flying stocks. By their argument, the non-automotive assets alone are worth almost as much as all the outstanding stock at these companies, so investors essentially get the automotive operations free. Auto executives frustrated by the low values placed on their stocks have been quietly encouraging this analysis lately. .
3/23/1997	Driving the Dream Machines	THE auto companies create concept cars to explore new ideas or to hint at products to come, and while these one-of-a-kind vehicles serve as futuristic fantasies, they are not often driven by anyone except the engineers and executives who bring them to life. Over the years, like most people who attend auto shows, I had viewed such cars as four-wheeled fantasies, something I could drive only in my dreams. But recently I had the rare opportunity to take the wheel, or at least to ride as a passenger, in some of the year's most exciting show cars from the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. Most of these will be at the New York International Auto Show, which opens on Saturday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and runs through April 6.
3/18/1997	After 43 Fun Years, Ford Takes the T-Bird Away	With even the Beach Boys going bald and turning gray, perhaps it had to happen: The Ford Motor Company announced today that it will end production this year of its legendary Thunderbird after 43 years of building the car that found a beloved spot in America's cultural history. Introduced in Detroit's postwar glory period, the Thunderbird went on to win the affection of generations of Americans for its supporting role during their years of young love and adventure.
3/14/1997	Ford Chairman to Stay On Past Usual Retirement Age	The Ford Motor Company announced today that its chairman and chief executive, Alexander J. Trotman, would stay on 18 months beyond the customary retirement age of 65 for Ford executives, buying time for the company to decide on his successor. Three men are in contention for Mr. Trotman's two jobs, but all of them are relatively young. Without today's extension, Mr. Trotman would likely have retired in July 1998. The company said Mr. Trotman, 63, would instead stay on until Jan. 1, 2000.
3/14/1997	16.6% OF HERTZ TO BE OFFERED ON STOCK MARKET	The Ford Motor Company will offer the public a 16.6 percent stake in its Hertz Corporation car rental unit, selling 17.4 million shares in an initial public offering. Ford said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday that it would offer class A shares of the car rental unit, which is based in Park Ridge, N.J., at $21 to $24, giving the overall company a market valuation of $2.52 billion. Analysts had said that Hertz, the world's largest car-rental company, was worth as much as $3 billion. The company will retain 55 percent of class A shares and all class B shares, the S.E.C. filing said. Each class B share has five votes, compared with one vote for each class A share.
2/21/1997	Ford Will Travel High Road With Adless 'Schindler's List'	The NBC presentation on Sunday of ''Schindler's List'' will be unusual far beyond the fact that a broadcast television network will devote three and a half hours during a crucial ratings period to a black-and-white film about the Holocaust. In an out-of-the-ordinary effort joining Hollywood, Detroit and Madison Avenue, it will run without commercial interruptions from advertisers, NBC or local stations. The adless program was made possible by a decision of the Ford Motor Company, in consultation with a longtime Ford agency, the J. Walter Thompson Company, to become the exclusive sponsor of ''Schindler's List,'' the 1993 film that won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Neither Ford nor the agency would discuss the cost of the sponsorship, which was negotiated as part of Ford's purchase of prime-time spots on NBC for the 1996-97 season, but one estimate of $8 million was deemed too high.
2/20/1997	Ford Agrees to Sell Heavy-Truck Business	The Ford Motor Company agreed today to sell its heavy-duty truck business to the Freightliner Corporation, a unit of Daimler-Benz A.G., in a move that would allow Ford to shed a money-losing business and Freightliner to increase its market share in the United States. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Analysts estimated the price at about $200 million.
2/8/1997	A Supplier Strike Idles Lines at Ford	Johnson Controls Inc. and the United Automobile Workers said today that they had made no plans to resume the contract negotiations that broke off at midnight, stopping production of some Ford Motor vans and trucks. Some 500 union workers have been on strike for 11 days at Johnson Controls auto seat plants in Plymouth, Mich., and Oberlin, Ohio. Today, Ford stopped building the Econoline vans and Expedition sport utility vehicles that use the seats.
2/5/1997	For frequent-stay awards, the two Hiltons join forces in an agreement aimed at the bottom line.	THE Hilton Hotels Corporation's chief executive, Stephen Bollenbach, tells his troops that ''the biggest players win the game'' when he is talking about the impact of the Hilton Honors frequent-stay program on the chain's bottom line. It's the same for the five million or so members of the program, best known for ''double-dipping'' (guests earn both points and miles), since it has turned into Hilton Honors Worldwide through an agreement, effective last Saturday, with the Hilton International unit of the Ladbroke Group. Now there are 160 Hilton International hotels -- in such alluring destinations as Paris, Istanbul and Kuala Lumpur -- where guests can earn and use points or miles.
2/5/1997	Ford's Sales Increase 2.8%, While Toyota's Soar 55%	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales rose 2.8 percent in January from a year ago, while Toyota said its sales jumped 55.5 percent. The final tally of sales figures showed that in January, American auto makers lost ground to their Japanese and European competitors. Over all, auto sales rose 6.3 percent last month, with car sales up 8.3 percent and truck sales up 3.8 percent.
2/4/1997	January Car Sales Up 2.3%; Foreign Makers Have Surge	Foreign auto makers showed the biggest sales gains in the American auto market last month as the strong dollar continued to help them offer generous lease deals and low prices. Among the nine auto makers reporting January results today, sales rose 2.3 percent from a year ago. Foreign auto makers reporting results today saw their combined sales rise 10.9 percent, while the combined sales of the two American auto makers reporting results today dropped a tenth of 1 percent.
1/30/1997	Ford Reports Higher Earnings for 1996	The Ford Motor Company reported higher earnings today for the fourth quarter and all of 1996, despite continued losses in the European and Latin American divisions. Ford has long been trying to make its cars less expensively, and Ford executives said that this year, for the first time, Ford would succeed in keeping its cost structure below that of the preceding year. ''Our costs in 1997 will be below what they were in 1996,'' John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said.
1/29/1997	Auto-Seat Plants Hit by Strike	Roughly 500 workers went on strike today at two auto parts factories, in Ohio and Michigan, to demand higher wages and better benefits, another sign of rising wage pressures in the Midwest. At least 300 workers walked out at a seat factory in Plymouth, Mich., and 200 more went on strike at a seat factory in Oberlin, Ohio. Johnson Controls Inc. owns both factories.
1/29/1997	Ford to Sponsor New Theater on 42d Street	With 42d Street turning more and more into Main Street, U.S.A., it was probably only a matter of time before the Ford Motor Company came rumbling along. And it did so yesterday in extravagant style, bestowing its name -- and untold millions of dollars -- on the new 1,839-seat theater being built by Livent Inc. of Toronto. The structure is rising on a site from 42d to 43d Street, west of Broadway, where the Lyric and Apollo Theaters stood. It will incorporate architectural elements from both of the old playhouses.
1/26/1997	When Job Cuts Don't Go Over Well	Ford workers from throughout Britain demonstrated in London on Thursday to protest job cutbacks at a plant in the north of England. (Associated Press)
1/23/1997	Ford to Lift Stake In Chinese Truck Maker	The Ford Motor Company plans to invest $40 million to lift its stake in the Jiangling Motors Company, a Chinese truck maker, to 33 percent, a Jiangling official said yesterday.
1/22/1997	Foreign Car Makers Seek Low End of Sport Utility Niche	Clutching a white plastic shopping bag full of car brochures, Carolyn Spicer, a 52-year-old credit union manager, stood at the North American International Auto Show here and carefully studied the light-gray, Jeep-like Honda CR-V on the platform. After looking at it from the front and the side, she guessed it would sell for $25,000 when it goes on sale next month. So she was surprised to learn that the sticker price would be just $19,300 for a well-equipped model. ''If they keep that price,'' she said, ''it's going to really go.''
1/17/1997	Ford Plans Cutbacks at British Assembly Plant	In the first big step toward turning its unprofitable European operations around, the Ford Motor Company announced today that it would reduce employment by a third, or 1,300 workers, at its Halewood assembly plant near Liverpool, which makes its European Escort models. Ford said it would produce fewer Escorts at the plant in northwest England through 1999, and then held out the possibility that it might begin building a new multipurpose vehicle there in 2000. But it warned that any future production would depend on its success in controlling costs.
1/15/1997	Ford Sets Sale of Budget	The Ford Motor Company agreed today to sell its Budget Rent a Car unit to the agency's largest franchisee for $350 million, as auto makers continue to shed car-rental companies.
1/15/1997	Ford and Rivals Rewrite Rules of Production in Europe	Juan Jose Ubaghs once tried to drop a coin through the engine of the tiny new car that was coming off the assembly line here. It never hit the ground. That is because the Ka (pronounced KAH), as the bulbous little four-seater is called, is the most compact vehicle the Ford Motor Company has ever built: at 11 feet 10 inches, it is nearly three feet shorter than an Escort. It will also be one of the cheapest cars around.
1/13/1997	Ford Is Said to Be Close To Selling Rental Car Unit	Team Rental Group Inc. is expected to announce today that it is acquiring the Budget Rent a Car Company for more than $350 million in stock and cash from the Ford Motor Company, as auto makers continue to leave the car rental industry that they once dominated. Team Rental, a relatively small publicly traded company of used-car outlets and Budget franchisees based in Daytona Beach, Fla., would immediately become a major force in the rental industry, with a fleet of 150,000 vehicles at more than 1,000 locations in the United States.
1/4/1997	CUMMINS ENGINE BUYS BACK 1.3 MILLION SHARES FROM FORD	The Cummins Engine Company said yesterday that it had bought back 1.3 million of its common shares from the Ford Motor Company and would repurchase 1.7 million more shares on the open market. The company also said that Kenneth R. Dabrowski, a vice president at Ford, had resigned from Cummins Engine's board, as planned under a 1990 investment agreement with the auto maker. Cummins, a maker of diesel engines, said it would issue 3.75 million shares of its common stock to an employee benefits trust. The stock would be used to finance employee retirement savings programs. In New York Stock Exchange trading, Cummins Engine rose $1.25, to $46. After the purchase from Ford, Cummins has about 38.2 million shares outstanding.
12/29/1996	Reborn, Audi Joins A German Renaissance	PEOPLE who drive a lot of new cars may disagree about the merits of a particular model -- or about the future of the automobile, for that matter. But they are nearly unanimous on this: The new vehicles sold in America have never been better. While critics of the auto industry argue that much more progress can be made on safety, durability and fuel efficiency -- and even that the internal-combustion engine should be retired -- there is little doubt that today's cars are far superior in all respects to their predecessors of just a decade ago. Fresh designs use space more effectively. Computer controls make engines start easier and run smoother. Electronic transmissions shift gears for optimum power and economy. Air bags, side-impact beams and ''crumple zones'' -- not to mention antilock brakes and traction controls -- have helped to reduce fatalities and serious injuries. More thought goes into the controls and more care goes into the way the pieces are assembled.
12/22/1996	On an Oversized Horse	LAST year, in a flash of product-planning genius, General Motors came out with a new sport utility vehicle that held great promise. Smaller than the king-sized Suburban and bigger than the compact Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy, it could carry several tons, came with four doors and combined genuine go-anywhere ruggedness with an extra layer of plushiness. It was called the Chevrolet Tahoe and it had a significant problem, in my view. It could seat only five, or six with a front bench seat. Whereas the wildly popular Suburban is available with three rows of seats, the Tahoe and its GMC sibling, the Yukon, had but two. For those of us who eyed the Tahoe as salvation from mini-van enslavement, the lack of a third row was a bitter disappointment.
12/18/1996	People	* Sean M. Neall was named client services director for the Ford Motor Co. European operations account at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, London, a unit of WPP Group. He succeeds David Miller, who continues at Ogilvy in an undisclosed post. Mr. Neall had been executive management director for the Ford domestic operations account at the J. Walter Thompson Detroit unit of WPP.
12/15/1996	Financial Powerhouse Takes Aim at Bad Credit Risks	HENRY FORD famously insisted that buyers could have any color of car they wanted, as long as it was black. But he was just as reluctant to offer them credit. Only in 1923, two decades after he began selling cars, did he begin to experiment, cautiously, with financing. Ford customers could buy a $265 Model T on layaway, paying $5 a week for a year. Only then were they allowed to drive the shiny black car home. (Not until four years later did Mr. Ford give in to demands for more colors.)
12/12/1996	In Japan, U.S. Auto Makers Fare Worse Than Expected	The Neon sat under a garish arch of rainbow-colored lights. But neither the glare nor the special low-interest financing was enough to attract even glances from the few customers at the Yokohama Chrysler dealer one recent Sunday. ''When the Neon was released, I think most Japanese were interested because of the price,'' said Kentaro Oba, a 36-year-old engineer, who, like most customers, was interested in the sexier Jeep Wrangler. ''But the Neon was delayed in coming to Japan, and in the meantime Japanese companies have cut prices.''
12/12/1996	FORD TO STRESS COST REDUCTION IN '97	The Ford Motor Company chairman, Alexander Trotman, said yesterday that the auto maker would concentrate on cutting costs in 1997 instead of bolstering its market share in the United States. Mr. Trotman said at a year-end news conference here that executives were not losing sleep worrying about the company's 25 percent of the American market, but adding, ''We do stay awake nights thinking about how we can drive down costs.'' Ford is undergoing a five-year reorganization intended to cut development costs $11 billion by 2000. Mr. Trotman predicted that industry sales would be flat or barely higher in 1997.
12/11/1996	Ford Returning to Suburb, Souring Detroit Real Estate Shift	Dealing a blow to this city's hopes of an economic revival, the Ford Motor Company announced today that it was moving 2,500 office workers out of the downtown area and back to its base in suburban Dearborn. Ford plans to transfer all of its workers out of the Renaissance Center, a complex of five skyscrapers that the General Motors Corporation bought this autumn, by the end of 1998. G.M. is moving its headquarters from a 74-year-old midtown office building to the downtown center.
12/6/1996	Chrysler to Raise Its Dividend and Shift Top Management	With brisk sales of Jeeps and mini-vans producing a torrent of cash, the Chrysler Corporation said today that it would raise its quarterly dividend, buy back more stock, and make management changes aimed at rewarding some of the executives responsible for the company's success. Wall Street welcomed the 5-cent rise in the dividend to 40 cents a share and the doubling of the amount of stock Chrysler plans to buy back next year to $2 billion. Chrysler stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $35.875. The management changes, which had been expected, were announced after the market closed.
12/6/1996	Car Companies In United States Hurt by Imports	Japanese and European auto makers have come roaring back in the United States this autumn, by cutting prices and increasing rebates. After several years of gradually winning back buyers, American auto makers, particularly General Motors, are facing their toughest competition since the early 1990's.
12/5/1996	Ford Reports Vehicle Sales Dropped 2.2% in November	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales fell 2.2 percent in November, as the final tally of monthly auto sales showed that American companies had lost ground to Japanese and European competitors. The Big Three American auto makers built 72.1 percent of the cars and trucks sold in the United States in November, down sharply -- three percentage points -- from the levels during November 1995. Foreign auto makers, especially Honda and Toyota, gained market share given up by American companies, particularly the General Motors Corporation. G.M.'s market share dipped below 30 percent for the third month this year, analysts said.
11/14/1996	Ford Will Move Its Corporate Work	The Ford Motor Company unexpectedly said yesterday that it would move its worldwide corporate advertising account to Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, from the Detroit and New York offices of Wells Rich Greene BDDP, effective in February. Billings were estimated at $40 million to $50 million.
11/12/1996	Ford Joins Move to Used Car Warranties as New Rivals Grow	The Ford Motor Company today became the latest auto maker to offer a warranty program for used cars from its dealers, with the first ''quality certified'' used Fords to be sold next week from some dealerships in the Southeast. The program is expected to be available at dealers nationwide next spring. Guy M. Bertram, Ford's regional marketing manager, said he expected that 250,000 to 300,000 used Fords annually would be sold under the warranty program. An additional 20,000 low-mileage Lincoln used cars will be sold each year under a separate warranty program.
11/10/1996	When Your Basic Sport Utilities Start Putting On Airs	AS a teen-ager in the muscle-car-mad 1960's, I never fantasized about the pedal-to-the-metal street rods that were burning rubber all around me. My dream machine was a school bus -- a big box high above the road, the better to see anything and everything. I had forgotten about wanting to play Big Bad Wolf behind the wheel until I climbed into the 1997 Oldsmobile Bravada, which is essentially a fancy version of the tried-and-true Chevrolet Blazer. Then it dawned on me: sport utility vehicles are essentially big picture boxes. And it turns out that two of the newest sport utilities are school-bus simple. The Bravada, which was revived for 1996 after a one-year absence, and a chief rival, the Mercury Mountaineer, take the guesswork out of barreling through bad weather and tackling treacherous roads.
11/6/1996	Auto Makers Fell Shy of Expectations	Vehicle sales were below expectations last month, rising only slightly from the lackluster period a year before. Sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans were strong but the results were dragged down by car sales. Overall sales rose 2.2 percent in October, a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14.9 million light vehicles. The mediocre sales results could be a factor in the decision next week on interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Wall Street analysts said.
11/6/1996	The Downsizing Trend Shifts From Jobs to the Things That Companies Buy	When Leonard Garrambone became Nynex's head of purchasing two years ago, his assignment was clear: ride herd on the nonpayroll expenses, everything from furniture to health benefits to consulting. Nynex executives guessed they were spending $3 billion a year. But Mr. Garrambone wasn't satisfied with guesswork. After six months of sleuthing, he gave management the shocker: the actual number was $6 billion. ''People forget things like stationery or services,'' he said.
11/3/1996	New Union Contract Lets G.M. Trim Some Labor Costs	After months of sometimes acrimonious negotiations and strikes that idled tens of thousands of workers, the United Automobile Workers union and the General Motors Corporation concluded a new three-year labor contract early this morning. The deal, which will probably be ratified soon by 215,000 G.M. workers, averted a likely national walkout by the U.A.W. after Election Day. G.M. and the U.A.W. also settled a four-day strike at a crucial truck parts factory in Indianapolis this evening that had idled four G.M. truck assembly plants. Both sides continued trying tonight to resolve a walkout at a highly profitable assembly plant in Janesville, Wis., that makes medium-duty trucks and the mammoth Chevrolet and GMC Suburbans.
11/2/1996	Auto Makers Seek to Reduce the Danger of Air Bags' Impact	Chrysler, Ford and General Motors have asked the Federal safety authorities for emergency permission to switch to air bags that inflate more slowly, seeking to reduce the risk of neck-injury deaths among infants, children and short adults when air bags inflate at up to 200 miles an hour. The auto makers said today they would begin installing such bags within months in cars sold in Canada, where no Government permission is needed. They also said they would work harder to teach adults to keep children in the back seat.
11/2/1996	Contract Settlement Averts Wider Strike At General Motors	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union announced an agreement early this morning on a new three-year labor contract, averting a national strike against the world's largest auto maker and likely bringing to an end the greatest labor unrest in the American automobile industry since 1970. Negotiators did not settle a three-day strike by two local unions, but a resolution of those walkouts seems likely very soon.
10/31/1996	Job Shifting Is Big Issue In G.M. Talks	The showdown between the United Automobile Workers union and the General Motors Corporation this autumn is often described as a struggle over corporate downsizing and job security, but as striking workers here are quick to volunteer, the dispute is also about whether corporations owe easier jobs to older workers. Previous labor agreements already make it very expensive for Detroit's auto makers to lay off workers, so that most workers are effectively guaranteed jobs until retirement. In place of layoffs, G.M. has not been hiring replacements for the many retirees among its 215,000 U.A.W. workers, instead asking more overtime of the remaining workers and hiring outside contractors to do less-skilled jobs.
10/27/1996	Indeed, Less Is More	I CAN'T see it. After test-driving two versions of the redesigned 1997 Toyota Camry, I still can't tell how the midsize family sedan was ''de-contented,'' the auto industry's clunky term for reducing the cost of manufacturing a car. When Toyota began to develop the fourth-generation Camry, Japanese auto makers' profits were being squeezed by the strength of the yen against other currencies, which made it hard for them to sell their cars abroad. So the company ordered its designers and engineers to make the new version of its best seller profitable even if the yen stayed at near-record highs. Much of the task was accomplished by reducing the number of parts, which in turn requires less assembly time. For example, the front bumper has seven fewer parts than the bumper of the '96 model, yet it is able to withstand a 5-mile-an-hour impact, unlike the bumper of the '96.
10/17/1996	Weakness Overseas Is Drag on Ford's Results	The Ford Motor Company reported third-quarter profits today that barely met analysts' expectations, while disclosing heavy losses in its European and South American operations and an unexpected drop in profits from car loans and leases. Ford earned $686 million, or 56 cents a share, up from $357 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 8 percent, to $33.96 billion from $31.42 billion.
10/11/1996	Ford Places Top Designer On the Leadership Track	The Ford Motor Company today named Jacques A. Nasser, 48, to head its North American and European automotive operations, clearing the way for the urbane car designer to become the auto maker's top operating officer someday. Mr. Nasser, who had been a group vice president in charge of vehicle development, will take the rank of executive vice president when his promotion takes effect on Nov. 1.
10/6/1996	Checking Out Ford's New 'Ka'	At the Paris Car Show, which opened last week, Ford's new Ka mini-car drew some interest. No, it's not ''Ka'' as in ''cah'' -- ''Ka'' means ''vitality'' in old Egyptian.
10/4/1996	Sales by Ford Aid a Strong September for Auto Makers	The Ford Motor Company reported today that sales of its cars and light trucks rose 7.3 percent in September, contributing to a stronger-than-expected gain for the auto industry last month. Auto makers' sales in the United States over all rose 5.9 percent, bolstered in part by offers of cash-back discounts and subsidized leasing deals.
10/2/1996	While Lincoln-Mercury may not be trying for a new image, it's sure trying to sharpen the old one.	IN the past, the Ford Motor Company's Lincoln-Mercury division avoided poking fun at those who drove a ''big cushy sofa on wheels,'' as one fresh commercial puts it. That strategy always seemed wise. After all, many would-be customers are already convinced that many Lincolns and Mercurys fit that rather unflattering description.
9/30/1996	Talks Yield 3-Year Pact For U.A.W. At Chrysler	The Chrysler Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union concluded a three-year labor contract this evening similar to the union's recent agreement with Ford, leaving General Motors alone without a deal. Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W. president, said the pact reached today followed the same outline as the Sept. 16 Ford contract. ''The pattern has been set'' for the industry, Mr. Yokich said at a news conference.
9/26/1996	Ford Wants to Trim 1,000 Jobs in Britain	The Ford Motor Company is planning to eliminate 1,000 jobs at plants in Britain through voluntary reductions and early retirements, a company spokesman said yesterday. He said the move was part of an effort to make plants competitive globally.
9/26/1996	U.S. Auto Makers' Big Cars Give Way to a New Breed	James and Eileen Rawlyk, both 27, looked out of place at Stephens Buick here on a recent afternoon as they waited to pick up a 1997 Park Avenue, Buick's biggest sedan. After all, most shoppers were more than twice their age. Unfortunately for Buick, though, the Rawlyks were not interested in the Park Avenue for themselves: they already have a Volkswagen and a Saturn. They were picking up the spacious Park Avenue for Mr. Rawlyk's parents, and Mr. Rawlyk was quick to point out that he would really rather not have a Buick for himself.
9/24/1996	In the campaign for its new sports utility vehicle, Ford its traveling the young and haughty road.	THE Ford Motor Company is using old-fashioned snob appeal in an outdoorsy setting to sell its all-new Expedition, a big brother to its popular Ford Explorer model. Ford is scheduled to begin its fall advertising blitz for 1997 models on Sunday. The centerpiece of a slew of new television spots will be ads for the Expedition, a giant sport utility vehicle. All ads are by J. Walter Thompson Detroit, a unit of WPP Group and Ford's longtime advertising agency.
9/24/1996	Chocolate: The Stuff Of Shock Absorbers?	DRIVERS may one day glide over potholes on a cushion of melted chocolate -- or something with a similar composition. The idea of a chocolate shock absorber was inspired by a curious discovery made recently at Michigan State University. A graduate student in engineering, Dr. Christopher R. Daubert, and his professor, Dr. James Steffe, found that when a moderately high-voltage electric field was applied to molten Hershey bars, an almost instantaneous change occurs: the thin chocolate liquid becomes a stiff gel. The warm, tasty fluid is transformed into a semisolid within a few thousandths of a second after the electric field is applied, and it reverts to a liquid just as fast when the power is shut off.
9/21/1996	A Ford Is Seen As Candidate For Chairman Of Auto Maker	The Ford Motor Company's board has decided that Alexander J. Trotman, the chairman and chief executive, will remain for at least a year after he turns 65 in July 1998, and is considering a Ford family member to replace him then as chairman, people close to the company said today. The board is discussing whether William Clay Ford Jr., a 39-year-old great-grandson of Henry Ford, should become chairman or whether to tap Jacques A. Nasser, the 48-year-old group vice president for vehicle development, to become both chairman and chief executive, Fortune magazine reported this afternoon, citing unidentified people close to the process. Other people close to the company said that the board had not made any decisions yet on Mr. Trotman's succession.
9/18/1996	U.A.W.'s Pact At Ford Aims At Downsizing	The Ford Motor Company's new three-year labor contract with the United Automobile Workers union addresses two issues that have haunted organized labor for more than a decade: layoffs and moves by companies to rely more on outside suppliers. The new contract, reached Monday evening, requires Ford to guarantee a minimum number of union jobs, while adding incentives for the company to produce more auto parts itself.
9/17/1996	Ford Reaches Tentative Pact With Union	The Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union reached agreement this evening on a new national labor contract intended to protect the jobs of current and future union workers, while providing wage increases modestly exceeding the inflation rate. While union and corporate executives refused to discuss the pact's details, Wall Street analysts said the contract would last three years and represented a landmark compromise for Ford's 105,000 U.A.W.-represented workers. Ford guaranteed that the number of U.A.W. workers in its factories would remain at least at 95 percent of the current total, with Ford hiring new workers if necessary to replace retirees, they said.
9/16/1996	Ford and U.A.W. Optimistic On Reaching an Agreement	Negotiators for the United Automobile Workers union and the Ford Motor Company were guardedly optimistic this evening that they could reach a new national labor contract, as work at factories continued despite expiration of the old contract at midnight on Saturday. While Ford's car and truck assembly lines do not run on Sundays, maintenance workers were on the job today, as were workers at some parts factories with long backlogs. Ford officials said they expected all factories to run normally on Monday.
9/13/1996	U.A.W. Is Just Trying to Hold Its Ground With Detroit	For decades after World War II, the Big Three auto makers' negotiations with the United Automobile Workers were the biggest show in labor relations. The highly ritualized spectacle was watched closely by executives and union leaders in other industries because the U.A.W. had a history of winning big concessions, like automatic cost-of-living adjustments and fully paid health care for retired workers, that soon spread to other businesses. But with the auto makers' current labor contracts set to expire at midnight on Saturday, it is becoming increasingly clear that the U.A.W.'s glory days of big labor breakthroughs are over. Instead of wresting yet more goodies for their members, the union negotiators are fighting a rear-guard action to conserve what they have already gotten and to halt the erosion of the union's membership.
9/11/1996	G.M. Makes Offer to Union as Ford and Chrysler Continue Talks	The General Motors Corporation made its first comprehensive contract offer to the United Automobile Workers today, as national labor contract negotiations continued at all three Detroit auto makers. While G.M. has been negotiating with the union all summer on a variety of issues, from job security to worker safety, today's proposal was the company's first effort to bring all its different offers into a single package.
9/6/1996	Auto Talks Are Said to Focus on Parts Compromise	Detroit's Big Three auto makers and the United Automobile Workers union are actively discussing a landmark proposal to resolve their dispute over moves by the manufacturers to buy more auto parts from outside suppliers, people close to the talks said yesterday. The proposal, first made by the manufacturers and pushed particularly by the Ford Motor Company, calls for both sides to make broad concessions that they have resisted in the past, these people said. The auto makers and the U.A.W. are negotiating to replace their current, three-year labor contracts, which expire at midnight on Sept. 14.
9/4/1996	Auto Workers Choose Ford As the Lead Contract Target	The United Automobile Workers union decided today to focus on the Ford Motor Company in national labor negotiations, while continuing talks with General Motors and Chrysler, people close to the negotiations said. The union's goal is to settle as many issues as possible at all three domestic auto makers before the Sept. 14 expiration of the current three-year national contract, two people close to the talks said. The union will try to resolve the industry's toughest problems with Ford and then demand that the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation accept the same terms almost immediately, they said.
9/3/1996	Auto Workers Union Close to Choice for Final Talks	After a week of intense negotiations with General Motors and Ford Motor, the United Automobile Workers union is on the verge of choosing one of them for a final round of talks aimed at producing a national labor contract that the union would try to apply across the industry, union officials said today. The U.A.W. is likely to pick Ford as early as Tuesday unless G.M. improves it contact offer immediately, people close to the union said.
8/29/1996	Canadian Union To Bargain First With Chrysler	The Canadian Automobile Workers union announced today that it had chosen the Chrysler Corporation as its primary target for labor contract negotiations and a possible strike this autumn, the latest step in a strategy closely coordinated with American auto-union leaders. Basil E. Hargrove, the president of the Canadian union, said in Toronto that he had little choice in selecting Chrysler. The Canadian union has its biggest differences with the General Motors Corporation, but talks with G.M. have shown little progress.
8/27/1996	U.A.W. Said to Prefer Talks With G.M. and Ford First, Chrysler Later	The United Automobile Workers union is leaning toward negotiating a new national labor contract first at the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and leaving the Chrysler Corporation for later, people close to the union said today. While Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, could change his mind, the current consensus at the union is that negotiations should proceed simultaneously with Ford and G.M., people familiar with the union's decision-making said. The three-year labor contracts between the U.A.W. and each of the Big Three auto makers expire at midnight on Sept. 14.
8/23/1996	U.A.W. Delays Picking Target Of Negotiations On Contract	The United Automobile Workers union abruptly postponed plans today to select a Big Three auto maker as the first to face the latest round of labor negotiations, while the union's president demanded meetings with the chief executives of the companies. Stephen P. Yokich, the president of the union, said he had decided to delay a decision on focusing the contract talks solely on one auto maker because preliminary negotiations at all three manufacturers have been going well and he did not want to interrupt them now.
8/11/1996	Have Muscle, Will Travel: 2 New Ways to Play With Power	MY first moments behind the wheel of a 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP were on my frequently traveled route to the video store and dry cleaners. After a long wait at a congested intersection, I spotted a slight opening in the steady stream of cars, punched the gas pedal and quickly made a left turn. The tires squealed wildly for what seemed an eternity. Feeling embarrassed and irresponsible with my two young children in the sedan, I looked around to see if any bystanders had noticed.
8/11/1996	Quiet Riot: Executive Express Gets V8 Charge	EVER wonder what would emerge if Detroit tricked up one of its white-bread family sedans with a monster engine, a sports suspension and the steering gear to match? Actually, there is no need to wonder: Ford, a company known to harbor engineers who would rather be Indy drivers, has been doing just that with the Taurus SHO since the mid-1980's. And the all-new 1996 model, featuring a 235-horsepower V8 built in collaboration with Yamaha, is a pure delight. The ''executive express,'' as Ford's marketing department likes to call the SHO, is meant to blend in with the gray-flannel herd. The only exterior features that distinguish it from run-of-the-freeway Tauruses are discreetly flared skirts, dual exhausts, a small rear wind spoiler and a modest ''SHO'' badge under the left rear taillight.
8/6/1996	Sales of Cars and Light Trucks Slow from Torrid Pace	Auto sales in the United States have entered the doldrums, with sales of cars and light trucks slowing at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14.3 million vehicles in July, down from a 15.1 million pace in June and a torrid 15.8 million pace in May. The Ford Motor Company, the last big auto maker to release its July sales figures, today reported flat sales. Car sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent, while sales of Ford's sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks fell four-tenths of 1 percent.
8/2/1996	G.M. Sales Decline, but Chrysler's Surge	The General Motors Corporation's sales fell by 2.3 percent in July from a year earlier while the Chrysler Corporation's sales surged 18.8 percent, as overall demand for vehicles appeared to cool and shift toward mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks instead of cars. Nearly three-fifths of G.M.'s vehicle sales in the United States come from cars, while two-thirds of Chrysler's sales come from light trucks, which the industry defines as including mini-vans and sport vehicles. So the shift toward light trucks has particularly benefited Chrysler.
7/27/1996	Ford Shifts $3.5 Billion in Industrial Leases	The Ford Motor Company will sell $1.8 billion in leases to the BankAmerica Corporation, and another $1.7 billion to a partnership formed by Ford and BankAmerica, the companies said yesterday BankAmerica will pay about $1.8 billion in cash for the leases it is buying. The companies did not disclose how much the bank is contributing to the partnership.
7/24/1996	Auto Workers May Pick G.M. As Target in Contract Talks	Top officials at the United Automobile Workers are having second thoughts about their plans to choose the Chrysler Corporation as the target for labor talks this autumn and are considering the General Motors Corporation instead, people close to the union and G.M. said today. The U.A.W. traditionally seeks a three-year labor contract with one of the Big Three auto makers and then demands that the other two accept essentially the same agreement. The current contracts with G.M., Chrysler and the Ford Motor Company all expire on Sept. 14.
7/18/1996	Ford Posts A Big Profit For Quarter	The Ford Motor Company posted stronger second-quarter earnings today than analysts had expected, including solid profits from financial services and an improvement from its North American car-making operations. The results spurred a rally in auto issues and helped steady the stock market. Ford said that earnings rose 21 percent, to $1.90 billion in the second quarter, or $1.56 a share, on sales of $37.94 billion, from $1.57 billion, or $1.30 a share, on sales of $36.39 billion in the period a year earlier.
7/18/1996	Jaguar Considers A Small Model	Jaguar, the British luxury auto maker owned by the Ford Motor Company, is considering a small car to compete with some of the best-selling models of BMW and Mercedes-Benz of Germany. But a spokeswoman said a decision was still a long way off. The car would compete with BMW's 3-series and the C-class sedans of Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz. Both lines attract younger, less affluent customers.
7/16/1996	Ford Offers White-Collar Early Retirement Plans	The Ford Motor Company will offer early retirement packages to white-collar workers in an effort to shed 2,000 employees from its auto operations around the world by the end of the year, helping the auto maker reduce costs and bring in employees with new skills. The early retirement incentives being offered to 4,000 workers are Ford's first in five years for administrators and middle managers. Ford focused on well-paid senior managers and executives in its packages over the last two years.
7/12/1996	Ford to Take Full Control Of Ailing Budget Rent a Car	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would take control of the money-losing Budget Rent a Car Corporation. Ford will pay cash to John J. Nevin, an investor, for his stake in the privately held Budget, but the companies declined to disclose the terms of the deal.
7/4/1996	Auto Sales in June Slowed From May's Frantic Pace	Auto sales slowed from a frantic sprint to a slow jog in June, suggesting a slowdown in economic growth, economists said. The annualized pace of sales dropped to 15.2 million cars and light trucks last month from a torrid 15.8 million in May, a downshifting that economists and Wall Street analysts greeted as a sign that the economy was settling down to a steadier pace and was less likely to overheat.
6/25/1996	G.M.'s Labor Costs for Parts Exceed Rivals', Study Says	The General Motors Corporation's labor costs for auto parts are $440 higher a vehicle than the Ford Motor Company's costs and $600 higher a vehicle than the Chrysler Corporation's because G.M. buys fewer parts from low-cost outside suppliers, according to a study issued here today. The study, by an independent consulting firm in this northern suburb of Detroit, bolsters G.M.'s position in this summer's labor negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union. G.M. has been seeking extra concessions this year from the U.A.W. to offset the disadvantage the company has from manufacturing so many of its own parts using highly paid union workers.
6/23/1996	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Taurus G vs. Chevrolet Lumina;Some Cheap Shots In the Price Fight	IT'S not easy being the king of the hill. Just when things are going nicely, some pretender starts taking shots at the throne. Consider, for instance, the embattled reign of the Ford Taurus, the best-selling car in America for the last four years. Soon after an all-new and radically restyled Taurus went on sale last fall, struggling to find buyers amid considerable publicity over Ford's higher sticker prices, Chevrolet reached into its quiver and fired off a few arrows at its longtime rival. Chevy's national ad campaign promoted its midsize Lumina as having several advantages and a $2,000 price edge over the least expensive Taurus, the GL.
6/23/1996	To Buyers, the Spoils of War	A BRAWL has broken out for the title of America's best-selling car, and consumers stand to benefit from some special deals for midsize sedans.
6/22/1996	2 Companies to Share Cost of Auto Recall	"The Ford Motor Company and the United Technologies Corporation said today that they had agreed to share the cost of recalling 8.7 million vehicles that may contain faulty ignition switches supplied by United Technologies. United Technologies, based in Hartford, said it had reached """"an amicable agreement"""" with Ford to share costs that could run to $300 million. The recall is the largest ever by a single manufacturer."
6/21/1996	Evans Group To Quit an Account	The Seattle office of the Evans Group said yesterday that it would resign the account of the Northwest Ford Dealers Advertising Association because the Ford Motor Company was encouraging dealer groups to consolidate their accounts with the national Ford agency, the J. Walter Thompson Company unit of the WPP Group. Billings on the account, which Evans has handled since January 1995, were estimated at $10 million. Separately, the Chicago office of Thompson named John Clinton, who has been president and chief executive of Thompson Canada in Toronto since 1994, as executive vice president and general manager. Mr. Clinton, 39, who is also a director of Thompson North America, succeeds J. Steve Davis, who left recently to become president and chief executive of the New York office of Young & Rubicam Inc. Ted Nation, 40, general manager at Thompson Chile in Santiago, succeeds Mr. Clinton at Thompson Canada.
6/15/1996	G.M.'s Rocky Labor Ties: Do Rivals Have It Easier?	The Ford Motor Company has not suffered a strike in a decade, while the General Motors Corporation has endured eight strikes in the last three years, including a 17-day walkout in March that cost the company $900 million in after-tax profits. That startling comparison of labor relations was made over and over again here this week as the United Automobile Workers union officially opened negotiations with General Motors, Ford and the Chrysler Corporation. The disparity partly reflects differences in the way that General Motors and Ford handle the union, but is also misleading because G.M. has an inherently more difficult task in its labor relations, auto industry executives, union officials and labor experts said this week.
6/15/1996	Ford Unit to Auction Nearly $1 Billion in Municipal Bonds	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that its USL Capital subsidiary would auction almost $1 billion in municipal bonds as part of Ford's plan to shed its nonautomotive finance operations. The sale would be the largest by a single investor in the municipal bond market since 1993, when Loews/CNA Holdings, an insurance unit of the Loews Corporation, sold $2.4 billion in bonds to raise cash to offset asbestos-related losses.
6/11/1996	Negotiations Begin on Auto Industry Pact	"Officials from the United Automobile Workers union and the Ford Motor Company were carrying baseball bats when they showed up here today for the ritual of opening negotiations on a three-year labor contract, but their meeting was cordial and largely ceremonial. Stephen P. Yokich, the president of the U.A.W., and his aides brought two baseball bats given to them by activists who urged them to """"go to bat"""" to stop auto makers from buying more parts from outside companies. Warned how Mr. Yokich had armed himself for the talks, Alexander J. Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, picked up his own bat to show that he could play ball with the union."
6/5/1996	Ford Reports Slim Sales Gain As Some Models Lose Ground	The Ford Motor Company's domestic vehicle sales rose just 1.3 percent in May, and sales of many models were lower, the company said today. Ford's Lincoln luxury-car line posted weak results, as did the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar -- two cars Ford has told suppliers it will replace eventually with a small sport utility vehicle. Ford's car sales fell 1.6 percent, eating into the company's sales of light trucks, like pickups, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans, which edged up 3.9 percent.
6/5/1996	Ford and Mazda to Close Factory in New Zealand	The Ford Motor Company and the Mazda Motor Company said yesterday they would close their assembly plant in New Zealand next March. They spent $60 million to build the assembly plant in the city of Manukau in 1986-87 to get around New Zealand's 55 percent duty on imported vehicles. The tariff, which has declined yearly, will be 25 percent in July and only 15 percent by the end of the decade. Ford said the plant would need a big cash infusion for new model changes next year and was not worth the investment. The joint venture built 10,000 Ford and Mazda cars and trucks last year. Analysts said Ford could build its new cars and trucks more cheaply in surrounding countries and export them to New Zealand. (Bloomberg Business News)
6/2/1996	BEHIND THE WHEEL/'97 Ford Escort vs. Chevrolet Cavalier and DodgeNeon; Sizing Up the Small Cars of Detroit's Big Three	"JUST a decade and a half ago, basic transportation too often came in the form of an econobox, those cramped, noisy, underpowered automotive appliances that got from Point A to Point B, and usually made the trip seem longer than it was. And, it is fair to say, Detroit's subcompacts of that era -- remember the Chevy Chevette and the Dodge Omni? -- suffered from unremarkable designs and often shoddy quality. Much has changed in the small-car market. Within the last two and a half years, the Big Three have introduced attractive, well-equipped contenders that are seriously competitive with foreign nameplates. The latest of these American-bred subcompacts -- that's how they are generally classified by the Government, though """"compact"""" might be more descriptive -- are the 1997 Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer. They are going head-to-head with the Dodge/Plymouth Neon, which set new standards for the class when it made its debut in 1994, and the Chevrolet Cavalier, which improved on the Neon with a complete remake for 1995."
5/30/1996	25 Future Auto Mechanics	"In a city where decent jobs for young people are at a premium, a nonprofit group and an automotive powerhouse have a solution. Yesterday, New Community Corporation got a $200,000 grant from the Ford Motor Company and the president of the Hillside Ford dealership to train 25 teen-agers to be auto mechanics. The 18-month program, to start in September, includes paid internships at auto dealers and will prepare its graduates for jobs that start at $11 an hour, said Richard Liebler, president of Hillside Ford. He added that because the program is planned and run by employers rather than by a technical school, its graduates stand a better chance of finding work. """"We will find them jobs,"""" he said. TERRY PRISTIN"
5/25/1996	After 2 Big Losses, Mazda Reports Razor-Thin Profit	The Mazda Motor Corporation, whose two years of heavy losses led to its effective takeover by the Ford Motor Company last month, reported today that it had returned to profitability, barely, in the latest fiscal year. But while the results indicate that Mazda, the sick man of Japan's automobile industry, is recovering, its health is not as strong as the bottom line would suggest.
5/24/1996	Ford Selling Rail Business To Unit of First Union Bank	The Ford Motor Company, which said last fall that it intended to get rid of its nonautomotive finance operations, took a step in that direction yesterday, announcing that it had agreed to sell its rail-services business to a unit of the First Union Corporation for about $900 million. The rail-services business is part of USL Capital, an operation Ford purchased in 1987 for $512 million. The company, then publicly owned, was known as U.S. Leasing.
5/23/1996	Agencies use zippy Dr. Seuss-style rhymes and comics to sell Ford Escorts and Mercury Tracers.	"THE agencies helping to introduce two redesigned small cars for the Ford Motor Company are borrowing techniques from children's books and comic strips to convince buyers the cars are more than mere """"econoboxes."""" The cars, the Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer, which officially go on sale today as 1997 models, are intended to compete with the Dodge Neon, Honda Civic and Saturn sedans. The Escort ads, by the J. Walter Thompson Detroit unit of the WPP Group, use Dr. Seuss-style rhymes to play up the features found in the revamped car."
5/17/1996	Market Place;Chrysler Lifts Dividend and Splits Its Stock	The Big Three auto makers, led by the Chrysler Corporation, which announced a stock split and a dividend increase today, are moving to improve returns to shareholders. The moves by Chrysler reflect an industrywide combination of strengthening auto sales this spring, healthier balance sheets and a new willingness to put slightly more emphasis on earning profits instead of winning market share. Responding to the same trends, officials at the General Motors Corporation and, to a lesser extent, the Ford Motor Company have also hinted in recent months at eventually paying out more money to shareholders.
5/16/1996	Mercury goes high tech to sell its first sport utility vehicle.	"THE Ford Motor Company hopes to make a splash er, crash -- with television commercials for the Mountaineer, the first sport utility vehicle to be marketed under the Mercury nameplate. In the spots, by the Detroit office of Young & Rubicam Inc., a mountain floating in the sky thunders to earth, landing on a deserted highway. The 1997 Mountaineer rests atop the mountain, moved there through computerized special effects by Digital Domain, the same company that produced visual effects for the movie """"Terminator 2."
5/14/1996	Next Wave of Electric Cars: Hybrids	A motley collection of electric and hybrid vehicles will buzz, whirr and hum their way over 64 miles from Chesapeake to Annapolis in Maryland on Tuesday, about 50 in all, depending on how many have run out of juice, shorted out a component or otherwise broken down along the way in the eighth American Tour de Sol race, which began in New York City and will end here on Thursday. The cars in the race are better than they ever have been. For many of the vehicles, the minimum demand of the race, up to 71.4 miles a day over a mixed city, suburban and interstate route, is hardly a challenge. The leading entry hopes to go 300 miles on a single charge, farther than many conventional cars go on a tank of gas.
5/10/1996	Ford Chiefs Say the Taurus Can't Stay No. 1 at Any Cost	The Ford Motor Company will not risk missing its profit targets simply to insure that its Taurus is the nation's best-selling car again this year, a top Ford official said today. Partly because of heavy advertising and generous rebates, the Taurus has held that position for the last four years. But the Honda Accord narrowly outsold the Taurus during the first four months of this year, 124,927 to 123,837, a pattern that Ford's critics have attributed to the company's decision to redesign the Taurus and to raise the price when the new model was introduced last fall.
5/9/1996	Competition May Thin Profits In Sport Utilities	From pint-sized Jeep Wranglers to Chevrolet Suburbans the size of a garage, sport utility vehicles have been the mainstay of profits at Detroit's Big Three auto makers since the late 1980's. But now a small traffic jam of new models is emerging in the market, and auto executives predict that the profits, while still enormous, will start to erode. The Ford Motor Company plans to display its largest offering, the three-bench, nine-passenger Ford Expedition, at its annual meeting in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday. In the last four months, Toyota has introduced the small RAV 4 sport utility and the Lexus LX 450, Nissan has completely redesigned its Pathfinder and Chrysler has come out with a new Jeep Wrangler.
5/9/1996	Shares of Ford's Finance Unit Leap 20%	Shares of the Associates First Capital Corporation jumped about 20 percent yesterday in the first day of trading, making the Ford Motor Company unit the biggest publicly owned consumer finance company. Associates First's stock, which was priced for an initial public offering at $29, gained $5.75, closing at $34.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. With 25.4 million shares changing hands, it was the second-most-active issue on American markets.
5/8/1996	FORD SELLS SHARES OF CONSUMER FINANCE UNIT	The Associates First Capital Corporation sold 67 million shares yesterday at $29 each to raise $1.94 billion in the nation's third-largest initial public offering. Associates, the consumer finance unit of the Ford Motor Company, initially sought $25 to $28 for the shares, but raised the price range because of investor demand. A group of underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company priced the stock yesterday after the close of trading. Associates, based in Irving, Tex., is the largest publicly owned finance company in the United States.
5/4/1996	Detroit's Sales Pace Slowed in April, With Ford Off 2%	In the auto business, April was a lamb to March's lion. Car and truck sales last month dropped to an annual pace of 14.6 million, seasonally adjusted, down from a sizzling 15.9 million in March. The April slowdown reflected surprisingly weak sales at the Ford Motor Company along with shortages of some General Motors autos, which were slow getting to dealers because of a 17-day strike in March.
5/3/1996	A More Varied Diet for a Cab-Hungry City	"Two vehicle models were approved yesterday for use as New York City taxis, prompting a prediction that in a few years the cabs cruising the streets will look a lot different, except for the color. The Honda Odyssey, a minivan, and the Ford Explorer, a sport utility vehicle, which both had been used experimentally since last fall, have performed beautifully during a brutal winter and a pothole-plagued spring and """"have earned the right to be added to the menu of vehicles available for use as taxicabs,"""" Christopher R. Lynn, chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, announced."
5/2/1996	Strong Auto Sales Point to Rising Confidence	Despite rising gasoline prices, two of the biggest auto makers reported strong April sales today that exceeded analysts' expectations, providing another sign that consumers' confidence is growing. The General Motors Corporation said its sales rose 7.7 percent last month, compared with April 1995, despite a recent strike that crimped the production of some of its hottest sellers.
4/24/1996	After Ford takes a greater hand, Mazda consolidates its ad account in Japan.	IN a departure from the usual practice in Japan, the Mazda Motor Corporation has chosen to concentrate all its advertising with Hakuhodo Inc., Japan's No. 2 agency behind Dentsu Inc. Generally, Japanese auto makers use different agencies for different models; Mazda had had its account at Dentsu and two other shops. The decision to consolidate the account appears to be guided by the Ford Motor Company, which took effective control of the financially ailing Mazda this month and is trying to turn it around, in part by adopting some American practices.
4/23/1996	Inventor Loses Suit Against Ford Motor	Jerome H. Lemelson, an inventor who contends that he pioneered VCR's and fax machines, has lost a case against the Ford Motor Company involving bar coding. Chief Judge Lloyd George of United States District Court dismissed the case last week, quashing Mr. Lemelson's demands for hundreds of millions in royalties.
4/21/1996	New Blood for the Big Three's Plants	"JUST over a year ago, Tammy M. Nedzweckas quit her $10,000-a-year job as a restaurant cook and started working the night shift at a Ford Motor Company plant here, earning $31,000 a year. Every minute and 15 seconds, she twists an air-conditioning valve cap on a Bronco or a pickup, slams the hood shut and clambers up behind the wheel to drive the truck around the corner. Then she hurries back on foot to tighten the next cap. Almost overnight, Ms. Nedzweckas (pronounced nez-WES-cus) escaped the clutch of poverty-level wages and grabbed a piece of the American Dream: a better life for her two children. """"I can afford to have my own house -- I can afford to have a reliable car,"""" she exults. When her daughter was born last year, she collected five months of paid maternity leave."
4/18/1996	Ford Earnings Fall 58 Percent, but Less Than Expectations	The Ford Motor Company announced today that its earnings fell 58 percent in the first quarter, but the drop was smaller than securities analysts had anticipated as the American and European car markets proved unexpectedly strong. Ford earned $653 million on sales of $36.26 billion in the latest quarter. The company's earnings a share fell to 54 cents, from $1.44 a year earlier.
4/17/1996	Wildcat Walkout Is Ended At Big G.M. Assembly Plant	Striking workers returned to their jobs at a General Motors Corporation assembly plant tonight hours after G.M. once again displayed its aggressive new approach to labor relations, obtaining a Federal court order for an immediate end to the wildcat strike. It was unclear how much effect the temporary restraining order from the Federal District Court in Cleveland had in ending the strike. Jim Tripp, the financial secretary of the United Automobile Workers union local in Lordstown, Ohio, said in an interview before the court order was issued that the union wanted a quick end to the strike.
4/16/1996	FORD SWEETENS TAURUS DEAL TO FIGHT CHALLENGE	"Moving to protect the Taurus's title as the """"best-selling car in America"""" from a challenge by the Honda Accord, the Ford Motor Company sweetened financing terms yesterday for the vehicle. Ford cut the financing costs for the Taurus and the Contour, offering loans with an interest rate of 2.9 percent instead of 4.8 percent. The average lease payment on a Taurus will drop to about $240 a month from about $270. The Taurus, which has held the top United States sales position for the last three years, has had sales of 91,828 cars this year -- just 486 more than the Accord. Ford also said it was introducing a new base model for its redesigned Escort, which goes on sale May 23. The new model will start at $11,430, about $500 less than the old base model."
4/14/1996	The Early Years: Jan. 8, 1928;Henry Ford: The Mussolini of Highland Park	Probably Henry Ford would resent being called a despot -- even a beneficent despot. For all that, he is an industrial Fascist -- the Mussolini of Highland Park, Fordson and Dearborn, not to mention works in Europe and agencies in every part of the world. No man in contemporary industry wields such dictatorial power. Since he and his son own the stock in the many Ford companies, he is responsible only to himself for dividends and for the success or failure of policies that affect the happiness of more than 125,000 employees. He dominates  everywhere. To be sure, Ford knows how to delegate authority, but the thoughts of his delegates are his thoughts, their principles are his principles. No doubt each of his companies has its Board of Directors which complies with legal formalities. But Ford is not only Chairman of the Board; he is the board itself. . . .
4/14/1996	As Full-Size Cars Vanish, Police Pay	The full-size police cruiser, like the old-fashioned family station wagon, is becoming a thing of the past, and many police departments say the change in automotive tastes is costing them money. The shift in the police car market began earlier this year when General Motors, citing shrinking demand for its Chevrolet Caprice, announced plans to end production of the 4,000-pound car, leaving the market to Ford's equally hefty rear-wheel-drive Crown Victoria.
4/13/1996	Ford, in Mazda Investment, Is Revered as Well as Feared	"The Ford Motor Company's decision to take effective control of the Mazda Motor Corporation represents a judgment that the ailing Japanese car maker, with its sales falling, can no longer make it by itself in an increasingly global and combative auto industry, executives and analysts said yesterday. """"They are a small company and today's world is getting very competitive,"""" Wayne Booker, executive vice president of Ford, said at a news conference in Dearborn, Mich."
4/12/1996	Ford Is Getting Tighter Control Of Its Partner, Mazda Motor	The Ford Motor Company agreed today to invest nearly $500 million in the Mazda Motor Corporation in a deal that makes Ford the first American company to take effective control of a Japanese car maker. Ford, which has held a 25 percent stake in Mazda since 1979, will raise its interest to 33.4 percent, the two companies said today. Ford will buy 52 billion yen, or about $480 million, worth of newly issued Mazda stock.
4/11/1996	Need to Cut Costs? Order Out;Outsourcing Saves Money, but Labor Is Frustrated	The anti-lock brake systems look out of place as they slide by almost silently on conveyor belts at the ITT Industries factory here. From the spotless white floors to the cool, filtered air to the young workers in white hair nets and white plastic laboratory coats, the factory seems more suited to the production of computer components than auto parts. Far different are the cavernous buildings in Dayton, Ohio, filled with endless rows of clanking, roaring machinery, where the General Motors Corporation makes brakes for nearly all its cars and trucks. A few rusting fans hang from the exposed support beams, the only relief when temperatures soar above 100 degrees in the summer. The floors are concrete painted black, and the air smells of oil and sweat. The workers, mostly graying men in their 40's and 50's, wear greasy orange jump suits or blue jeans -- and nobody has a hairnet.
4/4/1996	Domestic Sales Rose 4.3% For Auto Makers in March	Domestic sales of cars and light trucks rose a combined 4.3 percent last month, the final figures from the auto makers showed today, giving a strong start to the important spring selling season. The industry's overall performance was bolstered by sharp gains by Toyota and Honda and came despite the dampening effects of a 17-day strike that squelched production at General Motors.
4/4/1996	U.A.W. Sets Hard Stance In Bargaining	Faced with a renewed emphasis by Detroit's Big Three auto makers on paring costs, leaders of the United Automobile Workers union made clear at a three-day convention ended here today that they were in no mood for concessions. With the U.A.W.'s triennial round of bargaining approaching this summer with the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation union leaders and auto executives are preparing for labor negotiations aimed at a national agreement that are likely to be the most contentious in many years.
4/2/1996	Ford Workers in Mexico Accept Raise of 26%	The Ford Motor Company's workers at the Cuautitlan plant on the outskirts of Mexico City have accepted a 26 percent wage increase, averting a strike that was scheduled yesterday, Mexico's Labor Ministry said. The increase, which takes effect immediately, benefits 3,300 union workers. (Bloomberg Business News)
3/26/1996	Ford Shifts Leadership at Lincoln-Mercury Unit	The Ford Motor Company announced today that James G. O'Connor, executive director of export operations, had been selected to try to reverse the sagging sales of Lincoln and Mercury cars. Mr. O'Connor replaces Keith G. Magee, who was general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury division for two years. Mr. Magee will head Ford's European sales efforts. The changes are effective immediately.
3/6/1996	Auto Sales Rise by 5.6%, With Ford's Flat in Month	Auto sales rose 5.6 percent last month, assuaging industry and Wall Street fears that the industry was heading for a stiff downturn. The Ford Motor Company reported nearly flat February sales today. Ford said its car sales fell 4.7 percent while its truck sales -- buoyed by its redesigned F-150 pickup -- rose 5.5 percent. Over all, Ford sales slipped one-tenth of 1 percent last month. Sales of the Ford Taurus and its sibling, the Mercury Sable, fell 3 percent despite $600 rebates. But Ford was encouraged because the slip came as Ford reduced sales of the two cars to fleets by 26 percent, while retail sales of the cars rose 45 percent in February, said Joel H. Pitcoff, Ford's market analysis manager.
3/5/1996	Reversing Field, Ford Will Aggressively Cut Costs	After months of dismissing concerns that its cars have become too expensive, the Ford Motor Company has reversed course and begun an aggressive cost-cutting campaign that includes the elimination of 6,000 product engineering jobs. Ford officials said today that the company planned to reduce its product development staff to 23,000 from 29,000 in the next few years, mainly by cutting the number of engineers who are hired on long-term contracts but are not on the permanent payroll. Some of the shrinkage in staff will also come through retirements, possibly including an early retirement program, and by not replacing people who leave.
2/26/1996	Ford Move on Natural Gas	The Ford Motor Company is adding vehicles powered by natural gas to the fleet of cars and trucks driven by its employees while on the job. Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for environmental and safety engineering, said 10 percent of the vehicles ordered for the company fleet this year would run on natural gas. The goal is to have 30 percent of the 4,000-vehicle fleet using natural gas by 1998. The program involves Ford Tauruses, Crown Victorias, F-Series pickups and Econoline vans. They will be used first in southeastern Michigan and Southern California.
2/25/1996	The Koreans Are Coming! (But Where Are They Going?)	THE South Korean auto maker Kia -- rhymes with Pia, as in Zadora -- opened 35 dealerships this month in Florida, a state already sagging into the Caribbean from the weight of new-car lots. But a crowded market doesn't seem to bother Kia as it continues its region-by-region march on the United States. The Florida dealerships will join 140 Kia kiosks the company has opened in the West and South in the last two years, a period in which Kia Motors America went from zero sales to 25,000 annually. By the end of 1997, the purveyors of the econo-sedan Sephia -- rhymes with Kia -- and the perky Sportage sport utility expect to have 550 dealers seeded throughout United States.
2/22/1996	British Ford Has Egg Whites on Its Face	The British subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company came under attack in Parliament today after it was disclosed that the company changed black faces to white ones in an advertising campaign. Four black assembly workers found that their faces and hands had been colored white when a 1991 promotional picture was re-used this year to illustrate literature for the new Ford credit plan for automobile buyers.
2/11/1996	BEHIND THE WHEEL: 1997 Ford F-150;America's Best Seller Gets a Sequel	"I HAVE long considered myself a mechanical sort, but vacuum cleaners are beyond me. That is why I traded in the cranky Kenmore for a new model and why I was sitting in this truck outside the store, awaiting a guy from the stockroom. And there he was, muscles bulging, toting a huge Bissell box, with a strange look on his face. """"What IS that?"""" he asked."
2/7/1996	Ford Quits Test Of Engelhard's Smog Reducer	"The promise of the Engelhard Corporation's new smog-reducing technology dimmed yesterday, as the company announced that the Ford Motor Company, which has been conducting an exclusive test of the technology, had decided not to use it. In April, after Engelhard announced with great fanfare that a catalytic coating it had developed would sharply reduce ozone and other pollutants, the company's shares surged. But when the company said in November that the benefits from the new system were """"less than originally projected,"""" the share price plunged."
2/6/1996	Ford to Offer Cheaper Cars As Sales Sag	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would begin selling a lower-cost version of its redesigned Taurus sedan as it reported that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped in January, pushing the pace of total industry sales into negative territory, compared with levels a year ago. The cheaper Taurus -- which will be $605, or some 3 percent, less than the starting point for a Taurus now -- will be a new car called the Taurus G. It represents the latest retreat by Ford from its strategy of building ever-fancier cars and trucks and charging premium prices for them. Last month, as Taurus sales got off to a disappointing start for the year, Ford announced a $600 rebate through April 2.
2/4/1996	Betamax Redux: Big 3 Brawl on Electric Cars	THE Detroit auto makers will soon be selling electric cars in California, and Ford, Chrysler and General Motors say they want a common standard for how the cars plug in for recharging, just as their gasoline-powered cars have standard-sized filler pipes that accept standardized gasoline nozzles. But an old-fashioned rivalry threatens to complicate the market even as it struggles to be born. General Motors, which has the most experience of the three with electric vehicles, designed its EV1 -- formerly known as the Impact -- with an inductive charger, which transmits energy in the form of an alternating magnetic current. The current comes out of a paddle that looks as if it came from a Ping-Pong table. The driver slips the paddle into a slot on the front of the car.
2/2/1996	U.S. Auto Makers Fear Strength Of Dollar Gives Edge to Japan	With rebates spreading and profits threatened, the nation's car makers are now complaining about the strength of the dollar. When the dollar was falling and the Japanese yen was rising, Japan's auto makers were raising prices regularly and handing the Big Three auto makers the best import-fighter ever: a price advantage. But now Japanese auto makers are skipping some price increases thanks to a round of significant cost-cutting, and the price difference between Japanese and American cars and trucks is shrinking.
2/1/1996	Ford Reports 58% Decline In Fourth-Quarter Earnings	The Ford Motor Company today reported a 58 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings, as its successes as a lender proved inadequate to cover its problems as an auto maker. The company's performance was hurt by weak car sales in the United States and Brazil, currency losses and high costs for the introduction of the Taurus sedan and F-150 pickup truck. As a result, net income fell to $660 million, or 49 cents a share, from $1.6 billion, or $1.47 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales rose 2.7 percent, to $34.5 billion from $33.6 billion.
1/24/1996	Ford Tests the Price Barrier;Auto Maker Takes a Risk With Fancy Redesigns	When the Ford Motor Company introduces the redesigned F-150 XLT pickup on Thursday, the truck will not have simple steel bumpers. Instead, its rear bumpers will glisten with chrome -- an option for which customers used to pay $150. Other popular options, like power mirrors, dual air bags and air-conditioning, will also be standard on the XLT, the most popular version of the nation's best-selling vehicle. And that's just the beginning. Many features, previously unavailable on the truck, will be standard, such as a more powerful engine and a new front suspension that gives a much smoother ride.
1/23/1996	U.A.W. Is Setting Bargaining Strategy	The United Automobile Workers union, in preparing for labor talks with the Big Three auto makers this summer, signaled today that just about everything it has bargained for in the past would be on its agenda again. It said it plans to begin negotiations in early June with a broad agenda including job security, health care, retiree benefits and limits on company subcontracting.
1/14/1996	Ford REALLY Wants To Be Your Car Company	"Ford wants badly to sell those new Tauruses. But whether it's the lethargy of the economy or a shocking sticker price (nearly $19,150), the cars just haven't been moving. How about rebates? No way, said Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman, just 10 days ago. The Taurus -- priced well above other family sedans -- is """"good value,"""" he insisted, and """"is selling well."""" But last week Ford decided that, well, a $600 rebate on most Fords wasn't a bad idea after all."
1/10/1996	Ford, in a Shift, Is Offering Rebates to Increase Sales	"The Ford Motor Company said today that it had started offering $600 rebates and discount financing on nearly all its vehicles in an acknowledgment that it had miscalculated the strength of the market. Wall Street analysts also said that the rebates reflected the strong reluctance of consumers to pay higher prices for cars. """"The market in general has been very sticker sensitive,"""" said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at S. G. Warburg & Company. For Ford, he added, """"the first half of the year is really locked in to be pretty disappointing."
1/5/1996	Mixed Results in December As Auto Sales Slip for Year	Auto makers ended 1995 with some surprisingly good and some surprisingly bad sales, capping a year that on the whole failed to live up to the industry's high expectations. The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation both beat analysts' projections for December with solid sales gains over December 1994. The Ford Motor Company, however, posted disappointing sales, especially of its restyled Taurus.
1/4/1996	Ford Motor Venture Picks Site in India	The Ford Motor Company and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. of India have chosen the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu as the site of their planned multimillion-dollar plant to make Ford Fiestas, a Mahindra executive said yesterday. Ford and Mahindra, a Bombay-based utility-vehicle maker, plan to invest about $800 million in the next five to seven years in India. The governments of Tamil Nadu and the western state of Maharashtra had courted the partnership for months. The annual production target for the plant at Madras is 100,000 vehicles, primarily compact Fiesta models. (Dow Jones)
12/28/1995	Ford Redesigns Escort, Tracer	The Ford Motor Company is hoping a redesign of the Escort will help keep it near the top of best-seller lists in the small-car market. Details of the redesign will not be released until next week when the new Escort will be shown to the public at the North American International Auto Show here.
12/19/1995	Purchasing Units at Ford Are Combined	The Ford Motor Company has combined its two purchasing units into one global organization to save money in buying parts and materials. The company said it would not eliminate any of the 2,300 purchasing jobs and that any cost savings would be put back into the division. The new unit, which will combine procurement of auto parts, machinery and services, will be headed by Carlos E. Mazzorin, whose new title is vice president of purchasing.
12/14/1995	Ford Says Earnings Won't Reach '94 Level	The Ford Motor Company's earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year will be lower than last year, because of a weakening of the United States automotive market and the costly introductions of replacements for the company's two top-selling vehicles, Ford's chairman, Alexander J. Trotman, said today. In a year-end briefing that reinforced forecasts made in October by the company's vice president for finance, Mr. Trotman and other top executives said they did not expect year-over-year earnings improvements until the second half of 1996. In 1994, the auto maker's profit was a record $5.3 billion.
12/13/1995	Charging Standard for Some Electric Cars	The Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company took a small step today toward making electric cars more attractive to the public by agreeing to use the same type of charging system for the batteries. But the General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest auto maker, is pursuing a different -- and incompatible -- charging system.
12/8/1995	Redesigned Ford Taurus Gets Cool Reception	Last month, a New Jersey couple bought a Ford for reasons that would make executives at the auto maker wince. Kathleen O'Neill and her husband, Mark Lynch, bought a new Taurus wagon, but  they rejected the brand-new 1996 model in favor of a leftover metallic-red 1995.
11/14/1995	Takeover Trend Sweeps Up 2 Life Insurers	Continuing an industry trend, two smaller life insurance companies are being sold to bigger companies. The GE Capital Corporation said yesterday that it planned to buy the Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company from the Aon Corporation, for $400 million. And SunAmerica Inc. of Los Angeles agreed to buy Ford Motor Company's life insurance business for $172.5 million.
11/8/1995	NEW LINE TO BE CREATED AT TRANSMISSION PLANT IN OHIO	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would invest $180 million at its transmission plant in Sharonville, Ohio, for a new line to produce automatic transmissions. The auto maker said the plan would result in the creation of up to 250 jobs. Ford said the investment would include new tools, machinery and other equipment at the plant, which has been in operation since 1958. The line will provide capacity for a new family of transmissions with automatic overdrive for rear-wheel-drive vehicles to be introduced in the late 1990's. The line will have the capability of producing other rear-wheel-drive transmissions.
11/5/1995	A Cab That's a Van!' and Other Reactions to a Test Drive	Mauri Jaffe, cane in hand, approached the cab slowly, opening the rear door and lowering himself gingerly to sit. The seat was a bit higher than he expected, and only then did Mr. Jaffe, 77, seem to notice that the cab he had entered was not a car. He was one of the first people to ride last week in the first minivan to be used as a New York City taxi, and Mr. Jaffe, an architectural designer, was very taken with the model, a Honda Odyssey.
11/5/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 Spyder;  Razzle-Dazzle From the Top Down	IT is unseemly, I guess, for a man of my years to giggle. But when I get behind the wheel of the Mitsubishi 3000GT Spyder, I just can't help it. The mirth is contagious, too, because the sports coupe's shenanigans with its retractable hardtop -- whirring, gaping, lifting, folding, lowering and latching -- make it a sensation whenever you push the button in public, something else I can't help but do.
11/5/1995	Ford Is Recalling Trucks	The Ford Motor Company is recalling 38,300 medium- and heavy-duty trucks from the model years 1993 and 1994 to replace a part of the hand throttle system that might fail. The hand throttle swivel is used to set an engine's speed. There have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the problem, which prevents the engine from returning to idle, Ford said on Wednesday. Of the 38,300 affected trucks, 2,535 were sold in Canada. Ford dealerships will perform repairs at no charge.
11/4/1995	Ford Has 3.6% Sales Decline, Worst Drop Among the Big 3	The Ford Motor Company's October vehicle sales dropped 3.6 percent from a year earlier, more than expected and the biggest decline among Detroit's auto makers. Sales of the Ford Taurus sedan were off 16 percent from a year earlier, despite the debut of an all-new 1996 model. The auto maker attributed the weak sales to shortages of the Taurus wagon and lower sales to rental fleets, but it has started to offer incentives on Taurus leases.
11/2/1995	Auto Projects in India	The Indian Government has approved three auto projects with American and Japanese manufacturers. Mahindra & Mahindra of India has agreed to a 50-50 partnership with the Ford Motor Company for a venture that will cost about $250 million. Siel Ltd. is forming a joint venture with Honda Motor of Japan that will cost $31 million. And Hindusthan Motors Ltd. is allying with the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of Japan in a venture valued at about $174 million. (AP)
10/25/1995	Detroit's Japan-Friendly Cars Go to Tokyo	In years past, American automobile executives came to the Tokyo Motor Show to see the latest competitive challenges they would be facing from Japan. But at this year's show, which opens on Wednesday, the American auto makers will be exhibiting as much as looking. For the first time, the Big Three are displaying numerous models to sell in Japan, beginning in 1996, with steering wheels on the right sides of cars and trucks.
10/24/1995	China Chooses General Motors For Big Venture	China has selected the General Motors Corporation to be its partner in a $1 billion joint venture to manufacture cars in Shanghai, auto executives familiar with details of the project said today. By teaming with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, one of China's most profitable state-owned companies with an expert distribution and servicing network, G.M. will gain a dominant position in China's fast-growing car market.
10/21/1995	Ford Plan in Portugal	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would invest $233 million to expand its Palmela plant in central Portugal. The plant will make compressors for air-conditioning systems in a new installation scheduled to begin production at the beginning of 1998, the company said. The investment will be made over a three-year period, starting this month. Ford, the largest foreign investor in Portugal, said it would create 200 new jobs. (Reuters)
10/19/1995	Ford's Profits Fall 68%, Hurt by Weaker Overseas Sales	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its profits plunged in the third quarter, as its worldwide auto operations slipped into the red because of rising costs and falling sales overseas. In addition, the costs of starting production of its redesigned midsize sedans, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, bit into Ford's profits in the United States. The company said its earnings would sag for the next two or three quarters because of the start-up costs of the Taurus and the new version of its best-selling vehicle, the F-series pickup truck.
10/5/1995	Ford Had 9% Sales Decline For September	Following soft September sales reports from its rivals, the Ford Motor Company said today that its sales for the month fell 9 percent, more than what analysts had expected. The decline was Ford's first monthly sales drop this year and was worse than results at the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation, which reported sales figures on Monday.
9/27/1995	After a birdie, double bogey or hole in one, golfers are encountering subterranean messages.	FOR sheer ingenuity in the advertising business, few people can beat Jim Keenan and John Hoyt. Corporations and entrepreneurs are increasingly planting advertising in surprising places. An ad can be spread across a blimp, tucked away in the middle of a movie scene or disguised as fashion in T-shirts and baseball caps. But only a few promoters, like Mr. Keenan and Mr. Hoyt, have passed beyond that into chutzpah.
9/26/1995	Fiat and Renault Campaign for the Compact-Car Market	It had all the trappings of a carnival, but it was really a declaration of war. For 12 days this month, this smoggy northern Italian city became a burst of bright bunting, music and street theater, as the big Fiat S.p.A. automobile company introduced a range of compact cars bearing the names Bravo and Brava. Earlier, in Barcelona's huge Olympic Stadium, in northern Spain, France's Renault S.A. displayed, with a bit less fanfare but equal hopes, a similar line of cars called Megane. Both car makers have traditionally been linked in European minds with their staples, mini-cars and subcompacts. Their new models, priced aggressively and with a styling that has more Latin flair than northern European stolidity, are a frontal assault on the next level in the European market: slightly larger and sturdier compacts. That is the largest, most profitable segment -- but one that they have all but ceded to Volkswagen A.G., the Ford Motor Company and the Adam Opel A.G. division of the General Motors Corporation.
9/26/1995	Saint-Gobain in Talks on Ford's Glass Unit	Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A. is in talks with the Ford Motor Company to buy the United States car maker's glass operation, Jean-Louis Beffa, Saint-Gobain's chairman, said in an interview.
9/21/1995	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Campaign by Ford for its 1996 cars and trucks will be hard to avoid.	"WHETHER or not there's a Ford in your future, four out of five fortune tellers agree: there's a flood of Ford ads on the way. The Ford Motor Company is preparing a campaign for its Ford division's 1996 cars and trucks that includes the largest efforts ever behind a single model. To promote a drastically redesigned version of the Taurus, the nation's best-selling automobile, Ford and its longtime agency, J. Walter Thompson Detroit, will spend an estimated $125 million through the end of 1995 on emotional advertising that echoes the """"Laverne and Shirley"""" theme song by asserting Taurus is """"making the dream come true."
9/20/1995	Air-Bag Ruling in Fatal Crash Could Influence Other Cases	Nineteen-year-old Rebecca Tebbetts was wearing a shoulder belt and a seat belt when her car struck a tree in Holderness, N.H., on May 15, 1991, but they did not save the woman's life. Her mother's lawyers say an air bag might have, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled yesterday that she was entitled to a trial in civil court. What makes the case interesting, and possibly of far-reaching effect, is that Federal safety standards did not require the car to have an air bag. The Government required air bags beginning with the 1990 cars, and Miss Tebbetts was driving a 1988 Ford Escort.
9/10/1995	SPENDING IT; Some Truth in Lending Comes to Those Murky Car Leases	"WHEN Michael Hoffman, a 36-year-old fund raiser for a charity, leased his fourth new car, it was the icons in Ford's lease that won him over, like the ringing alarm clock that went with the late payment fee. But he also believed that the price for his Taurus was fair. The $347 monthly payment set by Leo Kaytes Ford, in Warwick, N.Y., """"was about $40 less than those advertised locally,"""" he said. But with a closer look, he might have spotted a handy new tool that gives consumers a reliable way to comparison shop -- something that has been all but impossible before now, despite the popularity of auto leasing. Leasing now accounts for some 32 percent of new car transactions, up from 15 percent in 1991."
9/5/1995	Trucks' Popularity Undermining Gains In U.S. Fuel Savings	Americans who might sneer at driving a gas-guzzling Cadillac are tickled to be seen in a Jeep, Range Rover or Chevy Suburban. But the enormous popularity of these light trucks is reversing the nation's impressive gains in fuel efficiency. Because the Government sets a much looser standard for trucks -- including sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups -- they use far more fuel than cars. Light trucks get only 20 miles to a gallon of gasoline, on average, while cars get 28, according to the Department of Transportation.
9/3/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1996 Ford Taurus; Radically New, Easily Familiar	ON the outside, America's best-selling car has been strikingly restyled. Slide behind the wheel, however, and the new Taurus is comfortably familiar, albeit much improved. Park it next to its predecessor -- or beside competitors like the Chevrolet Lumina, Toyota Camry and Honda Accord -- and the Taurus's smooth, flowing lines make everything else look staid and boxy. Take it for a drive and it grabs attention everywhere.
9/3/1995	Ford Presents the Importance of Being Taurus, Act III	TAURUS '96 is no Windows 95, but in the next few weeks it may be difficult to measure the hoopla for one against the hype for the other. While Microsoft enlisted the Rolling Stones, Jay Leno and the Empire State Building to promote its new operating system, the Ford Motor Company will settle for blanketing prime-time television with commercials for its all-new midsize sedan and wagon. And the company's reach will ultimately pass the national borders; Ford will send America's favorite car to the corners of the earth.
8/24/1995	Ford's New Dashboard: Is It a Better Idea?	"IT would be a challenging assignment for any designer: into a space a fraction of the size of a small bathroom, cram a bunch of gauges, a network of ducts for hot or cold air, a pair of air bags, a set of sophisticated audio components, a digital clock, several miles of electrical wire and the knobs, buttons and switches to turn it all on and off or move it up and down. And don't forget the big """"easys"""" -- everything has to be easy to reach and easy to read."
8/24/1995	International Briefs; Ford Layoff in Brazil	With sales sluggish, the truck division of Ford Motor Company's Brazilian subsidiary in Sao Paolo said yesterday that it would lay off 800 of its 3,000 workers. The announcement was made a day after General Motors said it had laid off 1,050 assembly line workers at its two plants in the state of Sao Paulo. Ford said it expected to first lay off 260 workers who had been hired on a temporary basis and whose contracts expired in December. A further 290 would be let go in September and 250 in October. A spokesman also said Ford would do away with the night shift and reduce its monthly output from 140 trucks to 110.(AP)
8/23/1995	FORD TO BUY STAKE IN CHINESE AUTO MAKER	Providing details of an agreement disclosed last month, the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would pay $40 million for a 20 percent stake in the Jiangling Motors Company, a Chinese auto maker, as part of a plan to develop mini-vans and vans for sale in China and overseas. The companies plan to use Ford's designs and trademark and Jiangling's components. Ford's stake in Jiangling will make it the second-largest shareholder in the company, which is based in the Jiangsu province. Jiangling's parent, the state-run Jiangling Motors Corporation, will remain the controlling shareholder with a 51 percent stake. (Dow Jones)
8/20/1995	Detroit Plans Some Grand Openings for '96 Pickups	BOTH General Motors and the Ford Motor Company will soon offer pickups with a significant change in their architecture: an extra door will be available on extended-cab versions of some models that will provide unobstructed access to the area behind the front seats. G.M. will be first to market the feature, which it calls a side-access panel, as an option on the 1996 extended-cab Chevrolet C/K and GMC Sierra full-size pickups that it will introduce in November. Extended-cab versions of G.M.'s compact pickups, the Chevrolet S-series and GMC Sonoma, will offer the feature starting in December. G.M. is expected to price the option for less than air-conditioning, which costs about $800.
8/19/1995	JOINT VENTURE WITH MAHINDRA OF INDIA IS PLANNED	"The Ford Motor Company and India's Mahindra & Mahindra plan to manufacture Ford Escort and Ford Fiesta passenger cars in a joint venture in India, Keshub Mahindra, Mahindra chairman, said yesterday. M.& M. has approved the issuance of about 6 percent of the company's equity to Ford, Mr. Mahindra told a shareholders meeting yesterday. """"The estimated range of the project cost is in the neighborhood of a little over 20 billion rupees, or about $634.92 million,"""" Mr. Mahindra said."
8/17/1995	FORD TO INVEST $135 MILLION IN FUEL-INJECTOR PLANT	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would invest $135 million in a Michigan plant to make new fuel injectors and other parts. The announcement ended speculation that the company would sell the fuel-related parts plant and buy equipment from outside suppliers. Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., said it would start revamping the factory, which is in Rawsonville, near Ypsilanti, at the end of the year. The plant will make less expensive alternators and more efficient fuel injectors and pumps for 1999 model cars and trucks, the company said.
8/10/1995	Mexican Peso Fall Leads To Auto-Sales Standstill	In the aftermath of the peso crisis, Mexico has turned into an incredible shrinking market for new-car sales, and world auto companies are scrambling to adjust. Mexicans are not buying cars. The peso's slide cut deeply into their buying power while interest rates on car loans hover around 46 percent. In the first half of this year, new vehicle sales dipped by 70 percent from the corresponding period in 1994.
8/4/1995	International Briefs; Thai Venture for Ford	The Ford Motor Company and the Mazda Motor Corporation of Japan said yesterday that they planned to build a manufacturing plant in Thailand to produce pickup trucks. The total investment in land and facilities would be about $500 million, Ford said. The plant near Bangkok is to have an annual capacity of about 135,000 vehicles, with production scheduled to start in mid-1998. (AP)
7/22/1995	Ford to Develop Honda Instruments	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would develop automobile instruments with the Honda Motor Company of Japan for a future Honda passenger car. The venture will help Ford in its efforts to increase sales of components to Japanese auto makers, Ford said.
7/21/1995	Ford Is Buying Stake in Chinese Company	"The Ford Motor Company is buying a stake in the Jiangling Motors Corporation, a Chinese light-truck maker, gaining a foothold in China as its United States rivals stumble. """"We are selling 174 million shares, and Ford has agreed to buy 80 percent of those shares,"""" said Fu Guohang, an official at Jiangling's securities department. """"The specifics of the deal haven't been signed yet, but Ford is definitely taking the shares."
7/21/1995	G.M. Rise Bucks Quarter's Auto Earnings Trend	If they ever played Broadway instead of Wall Street, the Big Three auto companies might consider calling their act The Perils of Pollyanna. With their widely varying second quarter earnings reports this week, they demonstrated the danger in their business of excessive optimism. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, which had breathlessly predicted robust sales this spring, built too many cars and trucks and watched their earnings slide in the second quarter as they ladled out rebates and other incentives to entice indifferent buyers.
7/20/1995	For First Time in Two Years, Quarterly Net Falls at Ford	The Ford Motor Company reported its first quarterly decline in profits in more than two years today, attributing the decline to the softening economy and the weak dollar. Ford warned that at least the next quarter was also likely to be weak compared with last year, as the company writes off expensive new factory equipment and reduces production to introduce new cars and trucks, including the new version of the Ford Taurus.
7/16/1995	A Business Deal Makes a Point for China	At first glance, China's selection of Mercedes-Benz over the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company to be a partner in a $1 billion mini-van plant looks like a clear sign that American businesses will pay a steep price for the political bickering between Washington and Beijing. But the mini-van deal, announced on Wednesday, is probably a better sign of something else: China's ability to make a decision for business reasons and, by carefully timing its announcement, have it look politically motivated.
7/13/1995	China Gives Big Van Deal To Mercedes	Snubbing American car manufacturers and fueling suspicion that China would make American industry pay for the diplomatic dispute with Washington, China today gave a much-coveted $1 billion contract to Mercedes-Benz of Germany The decision to award what is one of the biggest automotive deals in China was announced as President Jiang Zemin, on a four-day visit to Germany, toured the Mercedes plant in Sindelfingen, about 100 miles south of here.
7/11/1995	Campaigns for Ford and Mercedes in Southern California seem to cover similar creative ground.	IMITATION in most other businesses is called plagiarism, copyright infringement or even intellectual property theft. Litigation is usually not far behind. In advertising, however, some form of imitation is sometimes inseparable from creativity. Allusions to television, cinema and bygone ad campaigns are standard practice. Copycat ads are typically shrugged off as coincidental by many in the industry but can still embarrass their creators when other ad agencies accuse them of plagiarism, or at least a lack of imagination.
7/6/1995	While Incentives Often Worked, Vehicle Sales Slipped in June	June sales of cars and light trucks showed the power of incentives: vehicles with them generally sold well, while those with none remained for the most part on dealer lots. While figures released today showed that industry sales slipped one-tenth of 1 percent in June from the corresponding month a year earlier, gains like Chrysler's 11.7 percent increase were bolstered by heavy incentives. Indeed, auto makers and dealers combined spent an average of $2,700 a vehicle to promote sales, including cash rebates to customers and incentives for dealer sales forces, according to CNW Marketing/Research in Bandon, Ore. That amount was more than double the year-ago level and the highest since January 1992.
7/6/1995	CANADIAN UNIT AGREES TO ACCEPT FORD'S REVISED OFFER	The Ford Motor Company of Canada said yesterday that its directors had agreed to a new offer from the Ford Motor Company in which the auto maker would pay about $69 million for the 6 percent of its Canadian unit it does not own. Ford, based in Dearborn, Mich., will pay $185 (Canadian), or about $135 (United States), for each of the 511,319 publicly held Ford Canada shares. In April, Ford offered $150 (Canadian) a share.

6/29/1995	China Beckons and Car Makers Pant	China hungers for new cars. American car makers are dying to sell here. At China's annual car show, which opened here on Tuesday, thousands of eager buyers pawed at an array of shiny new models and car sellers did their best to tempt them with glossy handouts, flashy videos and seductively dressed women.
6/29/1995	International Briefs; In Brief	The European Commission said it had cleared an operation under which Philips Semiconductors International, a unit of Philips Electronics, would acquire a 51 percent stake in an I.B.M. microprocessor unit in Boblingen, Germany, near Stuttgart.
6/28/1995	Big 3 and Japan	"Of all the exaggerated claims made by both sides in the trade dispute, among the least credible is that the Big Three auto makers have earnestly attempted to penetrate the Japanese market, only to be blocked at every turn. Despite statements by the United States Government and the companies' own trade organization to the contrary, even Big Three executives concede they have barely tried. """"The biggest strategic mistake that we made over the last 30 years was not aggressively attacking the Japanese market -- from the standpoint of understanding the people that have become your key or toughest competitors,"""" said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of North American operations at the General Motors Corporation."
6/26/1995	Patents; A Federal Magistrate Rejects Decades-Old Infringement Claims Against An Auto Maker	"IN a pungently critical report, a Federal magistrate has contended that the inventor Jerome H. Lemelson should not be permitted to pursue patent infringement claims against the Ford Motor Company that his lawyers said could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The magistrate, Phyllis Halsey Atkins, in United States District Court in Reno, Nev., concluded that Mr. Lemelson's pursuit of new patents that piggyback onto applications he originally filed in the 1950's was """"abusive."""" In a report on June 16, she said Mr. Lemelson should be barred from enforcing subsequent related patents because he unreasonably delayed processing them for several decades."
6/16/1995	Ford Planning Moderate Rise In '96 Prices	The Ford Motor Company said today that it planned moderate price increases, averaging 2.9 percent, for its 1996 model cars and trucks, due this fall. Ford also priced the new model of its best-selling Taurus sedan, which the company plans to begin assembling on Monday. In a bow to the rapid softening in the auto market this spring, Ford said it would raise the price of the most popular Taurus version, equipped with power windows, power locks and other features, by 2.5 percent, to $19,390.
6/14/1995	FIGGIE INTERNATIONAL TO SELL UNIT TO FORD SUBSIDIARY	Figgie International Inc. said yesterday that it would sell a leasing business with $50 million in assets to Associates Leasing Inc. and use the money to pay bank and lease debt. Figgie's leasing unit rents and leases automobiles, trucks and other vehicles, as well as aerial platforms and other equipment. The terms of the sale were not disclosed. Associates Leasing is a unit of Associates Corporation of North America, a consumer and commercial finance company based in Dallas, with assets of $33.6 billion. The Associates Corporation is a part of the Financial Services Group of the Ford Motor Company.
5/21/1995	Roughing It, and Flaunting It, With Eddie, Orvis, et al.	WITH clothes or with cars, it's the image that counts, and that sells. Sports cars evoke youth -- or, perhaps, a midlife crisis. Mini-vans summon up images of suburban parents hauling children to scout meetings and soccer practice. But beyond these blanket associations, auto makers often try to affix to their vehicles brand images established for products far removed from Detroit. Clothing makers and fashion designers have long been asked to put their stamp on cars. Since 1976, Lincoln has offered models that bear the marks of designers like Bill Blass and Valentino. American Motors tried to revive flagging models like the mid-1970's Matador with gaudy designer interiors, and for 1978 it sold a Gremlin Levi's edition that had a denim interior with copper rivets. These vehicles typically featured distinctive paint and trim, with the designer's logo or signature splashed seemingly everywhere.
5/10/1995	Ford Sees 1995 Auto Sales Falling Below Level of Last Year	The Ford Motor Company said today that after lowering its forecasts for the second time in about a month, it expected 1995 auto sales to fall below the levels of last year. The company said it cut it projections again because of surprisingly weak sales in April. But it said it expected its own sales to continue to outperform those of the industry over all.
5/10/1995	Small Cars, Big Comeback; Europeans Rekindle Their Love Affair With Bugs	"Giovanni Grimaldi is in love, and he's not embarrassed to talk about it. """"We used to have a traditional car, you know, with a front and back, but it was big outside and small inside,"""" said Mr. Grimaldi, a 45-year-old sound engineer here. Then he laid eyes on a Twingo, a perky little car built by Renault of France."
5/5/1995	Ford Cuts Its Output Plans	The Ford Motor Company trimmed its second-quarter North American vehicle-production plans today by 2.3 percent, including cutting about 40,000 cars from its United States schedules. Ford's actions follow similar second-quarter cuts by two rivals, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation. Ford said late today that its United States, Canadian and Mexican vehicle output was now seen at 1.17 million for the current quarter, down from 1.2 million estimated a month ago and 1.19 million units produced in the second quarter of 1994.
5/4/1995	Space, the latest mini-van frontier: Chrysler and Ford spar over which model has more room.	THE Chrysler Corporation is not yet advertising the new models of its popular mini-vans, but it is already squabbling with the Ford Motor Company about the virtues the campaign intends to promote. The quarrel illustrates the intensifying fierceness of the fighting in the mini-van market, one of the most lucrative for the automotive industry. While the category had once seemed to offer limitless room for additional competitors, it has begun to tighten up recently.
5/3/1995	FORD GETS 4% PRICE CUT FROM SOME STEELMAKERS	The Ford Motor Company said that some steelmakers, which it would not name, had agreed to cut their prices 4 percent, effective this week, in a joint effort to reduce costs for both the auto maker and its steel suppliers. Faced with rising costs of raw material and a slowdown in United States auto sales, Ford requested the cut while promising to take steps that will mean savings for the steel companies, Ford officials said. Ford, which spends about $2 billion a year for steel, signed three-year agreements with steelmakers last year that raised prices an average of 8 percent in the first year and a total of 5 percent in the remaining two years.
5/2/1995	FORD TO MAKE LEASE-BACKED SECURITIES OFFERING	In a first among the Big Three auto makers, the Ford Motor Company this month is planning to issue securities that are backed by its car leases. The plan by the Ford Motor Credit Company has been two years in the making and may set a standard in the industry. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, is also working on a lease-backed securities offering. An offering from the Chrysler Corporation is farther off, industry analysts said. If Ford makes lease securitization feasible in the market, it will open up a major new category of asset-backed securities, analysts said.
4/20/1995	Earnings Increase at Ford On Stronger Overseas Sales	The Ford Motor Company said today that its earnings jumped in the first quarter, as strengthening sales in Europe and South America compensated for what the company called a surprisingly weak auto market in the United States. The earnings disappointed Wall Street analysts, who had expected a stronger performance from Ford's core North American operations. Shares of Ford rose 62.5 cents, to $27.75, on the New York Stock Exchange today.
4/12/1995	Chrysler and Ford Lower '92 Expectations	Disappointed by the slow pace of sales in the first quarter, the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company said today that they had lowered their expectations and were forecasting only modest growth in industry sales in the United States this year. Citing higher interest rates as a cause, both companies brought their estimates in line with that of the General Motors Corporation, which projected sales of 15.6 million cars and light and heavy trucks this year, up narrowly from 1994 sales of 15.4 million.
4/12/1995	Chrysler Engine Plan Is Sign Fuel May Stay Cheap	Chrysler plans to invest $750 million to build a new eight-cylinder engine plant within an assembly complex here, a sign that it believes gasoline will remain cheap and the light-truck market will keep growing. The engines would power two of Chrysler's most popular products, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, a sport utility vehicle, and the Dodge Ram pickup truck, company officials said today. It was not clear if the engines would also be offered in Chrysler's large cars, or in a new, larger sport utility vehicle.
3/28/1995	Car Makers Gaining Momentum in Brazil	Aiming to make Brazil a leading world car manufacturer by the end of the decade, the four biggest car makers in Brazil are doubling their investment, and new companies are planning to start assembly lines in this country. In rapid succession over the last few weeks, Ford announced a $2 billion investment; General Motors, a $2 billion expansion, and Volkswagen, $3 billion. Fiat said it intended to invest $1 billion in Brazil and $600 million in Argentina. Fiat's operation in Brazil is the Italian company's largest and most profitable.
3/25/1995	Judge Rejects Accord Over Ford's Bronco	"A Federal judge has rejected the Ford Motor Company's proposed settlement of claims stemming from a class-action suit asserting that Ford's Bronco II was prone to rolling over. The judge, Morey L. Sear of Federal District Court here, said the agreement provided huge fees for lawyers but """"zero"""" benefits for Bronco owners."
3/25/1995	International Briefs; 4 U.S. Companies Quit Tokyo Market	Four big United States companies said yesterday that that they would delist their shares from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, citing the low level of interest in trading the stocks and the cost of maintaining the listings.
3/24/1995	Detroit Utility Is Cleared as Sole Supplier to Big 3	Regulators in Michigan yesterday approved a precedent-setting plan under which the Detroit Edison Company is to become the sole supplier of power to 54 assembly and parts plants for the Big Three auto makers for 10 years, in return for which the auto companies will get substantial savings on their electric rates. The trade-off agreement, the largest of its kind so far between a utility and its major industrial customers, is expected to be tried by other utilities.
3/23/1995	FORD OFFERS SHORT LEASE ON 2 CARS WITH DATED DESIGNS	The Ford Motor Company is offering a lease in some markets that allows customers to drive a 1995 Ford Taurus or Mercury Sable for one year before switching to the new 1996 models due this fall. The 36-month program is being offered to customers who have leases on their current cars expiring with the next several months and may shop elsewhere because the Taurus and Sable cars that have been redesigned for 1996 will not be immediately available, a company spokeswoman, Joy Wolfe, said. The offer, good until June 3, will be made in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
3/21/1995	Canadian Rail Strike Denting the Economy	A national rail strike that began in Canada Saturday, idling nearly 35,000 workers, has already started to affect auto makers and other industries dependent on rail shipments and forced commuters to find alternative ways to get to work. Because of a shortage of parts, 6,200 Ford auto workers in Ontario were laid off or working half time. Delays also hit shipments of forestry products and such diverse minerals as sulfur, potash and coal.
3/20/1995	Chrysler Is Target Of Federal Inquiry	"The Chrysler Corporation and its finance unit have been asked for details about consumer lending practices by the Justice Department, which is also investigating whether the Ford Motor Company broke Federal lending discrimination laws. Chrysler and its Chrysler Financial Corporation """"have received an informal request for information from the Justice Department and, as is our practice, we are cooperating fully,"""" Karen Stewart, a Chrysler spokeswoman, said. Ms. Stewart did not have further details about the investigation."
3/18/1995	FORD'S FINANCE UNIT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION	"The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are investigating the Ford Motor Company and its primary finance unit to see if they violated Federal laws that prohibit lending discrimination. The investigation involves whether Ford and its Ford Motor Credit Company complied with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1968 in financing retail vehicle sales, according to a filing by Ford with the Securities and Exchange Commission. """"I can tell you we are cooperating with the investigation, and we believe our lending practices fully support Ford's policy of equal opportunity lending,"""" said Nick Sharkey, a Ford Motor Credit spokesman."
3/17/1995	Producer of Auto Show Details The Steep Cost of Javits Center	"Anyone who thinks automobile prices are high may want to listen to Mark Schienberg, an executive producer of the New York Auto Show. He knows about sticker shock, too. Since it opened in 1986, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has been the site of the auto show, one of the center's largest events each year. But in the description of Mr. Schienberg, the executive vice president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, """"We are longstanding and long-suffering"""" exhibitors at the exhibition hall, which has been plagued by scandal."
3/9/1995	Ford Revises View of U.S. Auto Sales	"The chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander J. Trotman, said today that vehicle sales in the United States this year might fall short of the company's projection of 15.8 million units. Car and truck sales will """"still be in the high 15's,"""" Mr. Trotman said. Auto makers are beginning to retreat from the bullish forecasts they made last year, while increasing the discounts on some models to spur sales."
3/4/1995	Ford's Sales Rose in February; Nissan's Fell	Contributing to the cacophony of signals about the condition of the auto market in the United States, the Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales of vehicles rose in February, while the Nissan Motor Company said its sales fell during the month. Most auto makers reported their sales on Wednesday. Altogether, sales of cars and light trucks fell 4.1 percent, compared with a strong period a year earlier. Light-truck sales edged up, while car sales fell more than 7 percent.
3/4/1995	Mercedes View of Efficiency: Ford Has Pulled Past Toyota	The American auto makers, led by the Ford Motor Company, have surpassed Toyota to become the most efficient auto manufacturers in the world, the chief of Mercedes-Benz's car operations says. The Big Three auto companies routinely say that Toyota's operations set the standards, or benchmarks, for them as they try to increase productivity. But the Mercedes executive, Jurgen Hubbert, said he no longer looked to Japan for guidance, as he did in the 1980's.
2/28/1995	Ford Planning Ethanol Car	The Ford Motor Company will sell an ethanol-powered Ford Taurus sedan starting early next year. Ford expects to be the only auto maker offering a ethanol-powered vehicle for 1996 and will continue to offer a methanol-powered version, the company said today.
2/14/1995	COMPANY NEWS: Reporter's Notebook; For Car Dealers, Familiar Medicine	"It may be of some comfort to anyone who has ever bought a car that few people fall for a sales pitch as easily as auto dealers do. """"They're fish,"""" said Jim Edwards, a Ford dealer from Louisville, Ohio. """"The easiest mark in the world is salespeople, because they're unable to stand the pressure."
2/12/1995	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Explorer; A Wagon for Blazing Trails in Suburbia	IT was one of those rare winter days when the air had just the right bit of nip and brilliant sunshine caused the fresh snow to glimmer: a perfect day for a drive in the 1995 Ford Explorer.I pointed the Explorer north from the Detroit suburbs to an ice festival in the quaint village of Milford, Mich. Driving unpaved, snow-covered roads like these is as close to off-roading as most Explorers ever get. Despite its rugged looks and go-anywhere utility, the Explorer is often found parked in front of the school at dismissal time or in the lot of the shopping mall or supermarket.
2/5/1995	Profile; A Silk Blouse on the Assembly Line? (Yes, the Boss's)	Deborah S. Kent remembers well her first day on the job. There she was, standing at the entrance of the Ford assembly plant here, awed by the cavernous 3.3 million-square-foot building sitting on 419 neatly manicured acres.
2/4/1995	U.S. Vehicle Sales in January Appear to Show Slight Gain	Sales of cars and light trucks in January appear to have narrowly topped last year's level after adjusting the figures for recent changes in the reporting of sales. Seeming weakness in initial figures released on Wednesday led some analysts to conclude that the market had substantially softened. But the recent changes in reporting methods by most auto makers made year-to-year comparisons confusing. As other sales reports trickled in during the last two days, a better, but still blurry, picture of demand has emerged.
2/2/1995	Ford's Profits Conclude Banner Year for Big Three	By announcing today that it had posted a record profit of $ 5.3 billion for last year, the Ford Motor Company made it official. The Big Three auto makers made more money in 1994 -- almost $ 14 billion -- than ever before. And Ford's earnings report illustrated how they did it, even though the market for vehicles constituted about a million fewer sales than at its peak in 1986: emphasizing sales of more profitable mini-vans and sport utility vehicles like the Explorer, loading record amounts of overtime on their workers to increase productivity, and cutting other costs throughout the company.
1/31/1995	Sport-Utility Jaguar Studied	The Ford Motor Company's Jaguar subsidiary is studying the possibility of building a sport-utility vehicle. Jaguar, in confirming a report today in Automotive News, a trade publication, that a study is under way, said competitive pressures were forcing the British luxury car maker to look at market segments beyond large luxury cars because other auto makers, like Mercedes-Benz, are expanding into those markets.
1/21/1995	KOBE EARTHQUAKE DISRUPTS THE FLOW OF GLOBAL TRADE	The flow of world trade has been disrupted and slowed with the closing of the port of Kobe, which before the earthquake on Tuesday was not only the largest container port in Japan but also a hub for the movement of goods to other parts of the Far East. The effects of the quake, which made the port unserviceable, were being felt in many parts of the world, with companies in Japan and the United States having to hold back goods.
1/21/1995	Auto Shares Decline On New Ford Moves	In a move likely to stoke fears that auto sales are flagging, the Ford Motor Company said today that it might close factories that make Windstar mini-vans and Escort small cars for longer than the one week it previously disclosed. And after the New York Stock Exchange closed, the Chrysler Corporation announced that it was expanding rebates on the more expensive versions of its Neon subcompact cars, which have been selling poorly.
1/20/1995	Ford's Move Raises Fears Of Slowdown	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would not make any of its Windstar mini-vans next week, citing a drop in dealers' orders. The production cutback for the Windstar, which is less than a year old and has been one of Ford's most popular products, fanned fears among auto industry analysts that the market for new vehicles may be softening as interest rates climb.
1/19/1995	FORD OFFERS $500 LEASE INCENTIVE FOR ITS WINDSTAR	In a bid to spur sales of its new Windstar mini-van, the Ford Motor Company is offering a $500 discount until April 3 to consumers who lease the vehicles. This is the first time that Ford is offering a national consumer incentive program on the Windstar, which was introduced last March. There have been some regional incentive programs. Ford was forced last month to close its Windstar plant in Oakville, Ontario. The company said that it had run out of some key parts. Ford also used the break to reduce unsold supplies of the mini-vans. As of Dec. 31, Ford had a 94-day supply of Windstars on hand, up from 89 days at the end of November, a company spokeswoman said. A supply equal to about 65 days is considered normal this time of year.
1/16/1995	Ford Plans Plant Expansion	The Ford Motor Company is investing $400 million to expand production at its F-series pickup and Bronco sport-utility truck plant in Wayne, Mich. The expansion, which includes a new body shop, is to accommodate production of all-new models for 1997, Ford, the No. 2 United States auto maker, said on Friday.
1/8/1995	The Best Seller Gets a Makeover	"THE auditorium lights darkened and a thunderous rumble shook the room, causing drinking glasses to quake on the tables. An immense globe rose from the darkness of the stage floor only to be cleaved by flames, clearing a path for the 1996 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable. The Ford Motor Company, in relying on such Hollywood effects for the cars' press introduction at the North American International Auto Show here last week, sought to remind its audience of how the original Taurus and Sable, introduced in 1985, shook the industry. When those cars were introduced as 1986 models, their """"jellybean"""" shape was a radical departure from any high-volume vehicle of the time. Some skeptics wondered whether Ford had gone too far."
1/6/1995	JAPAN KEEPS PACE IN U.S. CAR MARKET	American auto makers are celebrating a banner 1994, a year of ready customers and soaring profits. But one stubborn fact emerged today: The Japanese auto makers, despite offering higher-priced cars against American vehicles of improved quality, did not lose any of their share of the nation's car and truck market last year. In fact, they gained share, and the Big Three auto makers lost some.
1/1/1995	Speed Demons in Disguise	"BUT officer, the school Christmas pageant starts in 10 minutes, and my daughter forgot her halo."""" This excuse for going 45 in a 30-mile-an-hour zone is unlikely to make much headway if you are driving, say, a swoopy new Camaro. But it might work if you are behind the wheel of a Plymouth Voyager, with the built-in infant seat and Raffi tapes in the cassette player. But, then, hardly anyone would be tempted to speed in a mini-van."
12/15/1994	Ford Dealer Group Begins Review	"The Northwest Ford Car Dealers Association has begun a review on its account, with billings estimated at $10 million to $12 million, after 17 years at Cole & Weber in Seattle. """"There has been a little dissatisfaction over the account management in the past few years,"""" said David Lutes, president at Lutes Advertising in Portland, Ore. Mr. Lutes, who was retained to conduct the review, confirmed a report of it this week in Adweek."
12/13/1994	At Jaguar, Spit and Polish for the Balance Sheet	They were madly painting and polishing at the Jaguar Cars plant here one recent day, making the place sparkle for a visit from a loyal customer, Queen Elizabeth II. But the changes at Jaguar of late have been more than cosmetic. After nearly five years in which it has posted nothing but operating losses -- and made its parent company, the Ford Motor Company, look foolish for having paid $2.5 billion to acquire it in 1989 -- Jaguar appears on track to reap something more than a visit from the Queen: a profit.
12/6/1994	Light Trucks' Sales Lift Auto Makers' Records	The sound of breaking records has itself become something of a broken record in Motown, as, month after month, sales of light trucks have topped past performances. November was no exception, the auto makers reported today. All three domestic auto makers set November records for sales of pickups, mini-vans, and sport utility vehicles. The General Motors Corporation sold 167,687 light trucks in the United States during the month -- 13 percent more than its previous record November, which was in 1978.
12/2/1994	FORD AND V.W. ENDING LATIN JOINT VENTURES	"The Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen A.G. are ending a marriage of convenience that created Brazil's largest non-state-owned company and Argentina's second-largest car maker. """"We believe that Ford will be better able to compete effectively in these two markets by operating on its own,"""" W. Wayne Booker, an executive vice president of Ford's international operations, said. Autolatina Brasil S.A. and Autolatina Argentina S.A. were founded in 1987, when market conditions were poor, but Mr. Booker said those conditions had improved. Autolatina was 51 percent owned by Volkswagen, and 49 percent owned by Ford. The separation will be gradual, ending within a year, Ford said. Autolatina Brasil accounts for 47 percent of Brazilian car sales. Autolatina Argentina holds about 30 percent of Argentina's market."
11/15/1994	Ford in Negotiations for Pact On Electric Car Conversions	Like the look of a new Taurus or Windstar, but maybe not what comes out of the tailpipe? Then Ford will sell you one without a tailpipe -- or muffler, catalytic converter, engine, fuel pump or gas tank, for that matter. But only if you qualify. The Ford Motor Company plans to announce today that it is negotiating with U.S. Electricar Inc., a company in Santa Rosa, Calif., that currently converts Geo Prizms and Chevrolet S-10 pickups to electric power.
11/11/1994	Big 3 Want Clinton Aid On Rules	"Saying a Government finding of a safety defect in General Motors pickup trucks """"threatens the entire automotive industry,"""" the chief executives of the Big Three auto makers sent a joint letter to President Clinton today urging him to """"address the intolerable state of regulatory uncertainty"""" that the pickup issue could create. But a White House spokeswoman said Mr. Clinton could not intervene in a regulatory matter."
11/9/1994	Chrysler Switch to New Mini-Vans	The Chrysler Corporation expects to lose about 60,000 sales of its highly profitable mini-vans in 1995 because it will temporarily shut two assembly plants to prepare for new models, company officials said today. Auto industry analysts on Wall Street believe Chrysler makes $5,000 to $7,500 on every mini-van it sells. Taking the lower figure, that means the No. 3 auto maker could lose at least $300 million because of the lost production and sales.
11/4/1994	Detroit Sets Truck Records As Vehicle Sales Jump 8.9%	Drawn by the fresh curves of some 1995 vehicles and the reduced prices on 1994 models, customers continued to flock to new car dealerships in October, buying 8.9 percent more cars and light trucks than were sold during the brisk period a year earlier, the auto makers reported today. During October, the first month of the 1995 model year, sales of cars rose 2.9 percent, to 738,221, while sales of light trucks -- pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- rose 18.8 percent, to 525,285.
10/30/1994	A Small World Car, After All	"IT'S a big country, and Americans are big people. We like Big Macs, Big Gulps and Biggie Fries. We like our cars big, too -- even the small ones. This poses a challenge in building a """"world car,"""" a vehicle that can be made and sold globally with only small concessions to local tastes. The Japanese are masters at this, but Detroit has never been able to make Americans fall in love with Opels adored by Germans, or set foreigners swooning over the Pinto or the Chevette."
10/27/1994	Suit to Block Emission Rules Is Dismissed	A Federal District Court judge in Syracuse has thrown out a lawsuit by the Big Three auto manufacturers to block New York State's adoption of the California low-emission vehicle rules. New York now requires that all new cars sold within the state meet California's tough emission standards. The Ford Motor Company, General Motors and the Chrysler Corporation complained that because New York has not also adopted California's strict standards on gasoline, if they are forced to meet the stricter emissions standards they would have to manufacture a car especially for use in New York. Under the Federal Clean Air Act, other states may adopt California's rules or use the Federal rules, but may not require a third option.
10/27/1994	Ford Profits Up Sharply In Quarter	With car and truck sales climbing in the United States and manufacturing costs falling in Europe, the Ford Motor Company today reported that its earnings had more than doubled to $1.12 billion for the three months ending Sept. 30. Vigorous demand for products like the Windstar mini-van, Mustang sports coupe and four-wheel-drive Explorers enabled Ford to cut marketing costs in the quarter, fattening its profit on every vehicle sold.
10/23/1994	Oct. 16-22: A Bad Week in Detroit; G.M. Trucks Singled Out; Ford Is Recalling Compacts	Transportation Secretary Federico Pena took a highly unusual step Monday: In effect, he accused General Motors of making pickup trucks so defective that 150 people might have died needlessly in fiery crashes. The vehicles are full-sized Chevrolet and G.M.C. pickups produced by the nation's No. 1 car maker from 1973 to 1987. The trucks have fuel tanks mounted outside their body frames. Safety advocates have argued that the tanks leak when struck sideways, spilling gasoline and igniting deadly fires.
10/20/1994	Economic Scene; Big government and the Big 3 pass the air pollution buck.	"FOUR years ago Congress got a big round of applause for requiring the states to reduce ozone air pollution to levels that don't send asthmatics to early graves. But it left the details to the states. And -- no surprise -- regulators in the heavily polluted Northeast, who must answer to diverse interest groups, are at a loss on how to get from here to there. Worse, perhaps, the only Federal agency with the power to drive the bargaining to a conclusion that serves the public is hoping, hoping, hoping someone else will take the political heat. """"The Environmental Protection Agency has abdicated its leadership role,"""" argues Dan Dudek, an economist with the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund."
10/19/1994	U.S. to Aid Big 3 in Cleaner-Car Research	"A year-old Government partnership with the Big Three auto makers has developed """"a road map"""" for building a car that would go 80 miles on a gallon of gasoline with no loss in performance, safety or carrying capacity, Vice President Al Gore said today. But smaller competitors in the race for high-technology clean cars are complaining that the three giants could squeeze them out of the effort. That is because the plan calls for the Government to coordinate its research and development spending by seven Federal agencies with the efforts of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. Much of the research involves using electricity to power cars, a technology that the Big Three have opposed, at least for now."
10/18/1994	Ford Recalls Compacts, Delaying Production	For the second time in two months, the Ford Motor Company is recalling its new Contour and Mystique compact sedans because of a fuel system defect that can cause fires. Because it cannot make corrected tanks fast enough, Ford said it had halted production of the cars for a week, which will worsen dealer shortages of the cars just as Ford is promoting them with a major introductory advertising campaign.
10/13/1994	Ford Official Is Retiring	The Ford Motor Company said today that Allan D. Gilmour, 60, a vice chairman of the company and corporate finance expert, would retire at the end of the year. A Ford employee since 1960, Mr. Gilmour was twice discussed as a candidate to become Ford's chairman and chief executive. The first time, the board instead asked Harold A. Poling to stay beyond normal retirement age, succeeding Donald E. Petersen in 1990. The second time, in 1992, the board tapped Alexander J. Trotman instead of Mr. Gilmour because directors believed Mr. Trotman had more experience in automotive operations.
10/11/1994	U.S. Investigating No-Haggle Car Pricing	As part of a wider antitrust investigation of auto pricing, the Justice Department is looking into the increasingly popular practice of no-haggle selling by car dealers, according to dealers and others who have been questioned in the inquiry. It is not clear what wrongdoing the Government suspects. Besides possible price-fixing arrangements between manufacturers and dealers, the investigators might be looking at possible price-fixing efforts among the dealers themselves or the manufacturers themselves.
10/8/1994	TOYOTA DEALERS IN JAPAN TO SELL FORD IMPORTS	Toyotadealers in Japan will begin selling imported Ford Motor Company cars for the first time, as the American auto maker expands its sales network to about 300 Japanese outlets. Ford said yesterday that it was adding 5 dealers and 13 outlets to its sales network in Japan by November or December, including stores to be operated under a new company formed by the Toyota Katsumata Group, a major owner of the Toyota Motor Company vehicle dealerships. The expansion is not limited to Toyota dealers. It includes a second Ford outlet by a Nissan vehicle dealer that joined the Ford channel in May, new dealerships by three Mazda dealers and an existing Ford dealer, and additional outlets by two other Ford dealers. Since January 1992, when President George Bush visited Tokyo to persuade Japan to open up its market to more United States goods, Japan's vehicle manufacturers have tacitly allowed their vehicle dealers to sell American cars, Ken Brown, a Ford spokesman, said.
10/5/1994	Auto Sales Rose 7.4% Last Month	Sales of cars and light trucks rose 7.4 percent in September, as the Big Three auto makers gained market share from foreign producers by virtue of the surging popularity of pickup trucks, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles. The strong gain in sales, reported today by the auto makers, came despite concerns that higher interest rates could choke off consumer confidence and the ability of consumers to make monthly payments. The report briefly unnerved the bond market, which saw it as a sign that higher rates were failing to moderate growth, and Treasury prices fell. [ Page D15. ] Stock prices were also lower yesterday. [ Page D8. ]
9/25/1994	Ford Recalls 2 New Models To Fix Defect	The Ford Motor Company is recalling its new Contour and Mystique compact sedans because of a design defect that, if uncorrected, could cause a fire during refueling. Only 200 of the cars, which are about to be introduced in a $110 million advertising campaign, have been sold to retail customers. Ford dealers have about 8,000 others.
9/24/1994	Auto Workers Pushed to the Limit	With customers clamoring for cars and trucks, the domestic auto makers have been pushing their hourly workers at a record pace, and the strain is unmistakable. Today, the Ford Motor Company said that partly because workers at a parts plant refused to put in more overtime, it had to stop production this week of some popular pickup trucks and large cars. The General Motors Corporation is facing a threatened strike next week over the exhausting grind at a colossal assembly and parts-making complex known as Buick City.
9/19/1994	Very Late Report Card Finds Iacocca Wanting	"Henry Ford 2d was a blunt man. But on the subject of the decision that caused the greatest uproar during his last years running the Ford Motor Company -- his dismissal of Lee A. Iacocca in 1978 -- Mr. Ford mostly stayed mum. By contrast, Mr. Iacocca, who went on to success leading the Chrysler Corporation, in remarks to reporters and in a best-selling autobiography accused Mr. Ford of being everything from a """"spoiled brat"""" to a racist to a drunk."
9/18/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Ranger Splash; Loads of Attitude	"HIGH driveway quotient,"""" a neighbor said. He was talking about the conspicuous presence in front of my garage of a Ford Ranger Splash pickup, preening in what Ford calls """"vibrant red."""" That is a double-edged compliment, my neighbor explained. It means the truck is at its best when parked, since it can be a nuisance to drive."
9/16/1994	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; A couple of auto makers set out to buff up some rusty brand names.	WITH sales rising and a slew of new models pending, the Big Three auto makers are turning their attention to restoring the images of older brands that have lost their luster, or their way, in recent years. Besides ephemeral advertising heralding 1995 models, the brand-building campaign is taking more tangible, and probably durable, forms: At Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division, it means a less-confusing sign at its dealerships, while at General Motors' Oldsmobile division, it means classier theme music.
9/9/1994	Favored Prince Anointed at Ford	"Ever since Henry Ford 2d stepped down 15 years ago from active management of the auto company that bears his family name, people inside and outside the Ford Motor Company have speculated about which member of the next generation would emerge as leader of the nation's most powerful industrial dynasty. """"There are no crown princes,"""" Henry once grumbled, dismissing the notion that a member of his family must control the company. But the Ford family effectively retains voting control of the auto maker -- indeed, hourly workers still refer to the company as """"Ford's"""" -- and no one here has ever really believed that Mr. Ford meant what he said."
9/8/1994	FORD DECIDES TO INVEST $700 MILLION IN ITS OHIO PLANT	The Ford Motor Company will spend $700 million to build a new range of V8 engines at its Lima, Ohio, plant to power new Ford vehicles starting in 1998. The decision on the Lima plant ends a two-year battle between Lima plant and Ford's Cleveland Plant No. 1, which will need about 1,050 fewer workers by 1996, a company spokesman, Bill Carroll, said. The $700 million investment is for tools, equipment and training at the Ohio plant, where more than 600 jobs will be saved. Those jobs would have been lost because production of two different V8 truck engines will be discontinued at the plant in 1997.

9/1/1994	Insider Selling Trims Auto Stocks	Share prices of the Big Three auto makers tumbled yesterday, as reports of insider selling at the Chrysler Corporation apparently rekindled fears that the peak in auto sales and profits might have passed. Chrysler's stock was the first to get pounded, but investors later broadened their selling to shares of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation as well.
8/4/1994	Detroit Pact For Utility	The Detroit Edison Company said today that it had signed a $2 billion contract that would make it the sole power supplier in the Detroit area to the Big Three auto makers until the year 2004. The agreement, which is subject to approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission, covers 54 car-assembly and parts-manufacturing plants, headquarters and design and technical centers here.
8/3/1994	LTV SAID TO GET 10% PRICE INCREASE FROM CHRYSLER	"The LTV Corporation has won a 10 percent price increase for steel sold to the Chrysler Corporation, setting the stage for similar increases from the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, analysts said yesterday. The LTV-Chrysler agreement was reached late Friday and took effect on Monday. """"This is very big for the steel industry,"""" said Jordan Estra, a metals analyst at Merrill Lynch. """"It's probably the biggest increase in 30 years."""" Last year, steelmakers managed to get price increases of about 2 percent from auto makers, Mr. Estra said. This year, booming auto production and a tight supply of steel have put LTV, based in Cleveland, and other steelmakers in a strong position. Chrysler and LTV declined to comment on the contracts, but Mr. Estra and other analysts said they were able to confirm the 10 percent increase with people close to the negotiations."
7/28/1994	Japanese Offering Ford a Loan	With the Japanese Government struggling to reduce anger over the nation's towering trade surpluses and financially pressed Japanese investors pulling their capital back home, the Export-Import Bank of Japan is negotiating a huge, politically sensitive loan to the Ford Motor Company. The unusual loan being considered by the Government-controlled bank, which could run as much as $300 million, would be aimed at helping Ford manufacture right-hand-drive autos for export to Japan. That, in turn, could help reduce the Japanese trade surplus with the United States, which is expected to be as high as $60 billion for 1994.
7/28/1994	Ford's Profit In 2d Quarter Set a Record	The Ford Motor Company today reported all-time record quarterly earnings of $1.71 billion for the three months ending in June, as strong demand more than doubled the average profit the company made on each car and truck it sold. Ford attributed the results, which amounted to $1.63 a share, to continued robust sales in the United States and a stronger than expected recovery in the European auto market.
7/21/1994	Ford Prices Its New Line Of Compacts	The Ford Motor Company announced prices for its new compact sedans today, saying it expected typically equipped versions to sell for less than $15,000. The cars are scheduled to go on sale on Sept. 29. The prices are substantially above those of the models they replace in Ford's lineup, but below those of the Japanese sedans from which Ford hopes to steal customers.
7/19/1994	FORD INVESTING $555 MILLION AT INDIANAPOLIS PLANT	The Ford Motor Company is investing $555 million to upgrade manufacturing processes at its Indianapolis plant, which produces steering parts for all Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars and trucks, the company said yesterday. The investment, to be completed by 1997, also calls for the No. 2 auto maker to add about 75 jobs to the plant next year as it increases production of parts for Ford's European operations. The plant currently has about 3,200 workers. Ford also announced plans to add 75 jobs at its transmission plant in Batavia, Ohio, as part of an effort to increase output there by 38 percent in the next two years. Ford shares rose 25 cents, to $31.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
7/13/1994	Tweaking the Captains of Industry in Prime Time	"Michael Moore, the counterculture film maker who skewered General Motors and its chairman in the mordantly humorous """"Roger and Me,"""" is at it again -- and this time his camera lens has widened to include all of Corporate America. A few weeks ago, Mr. Moore, accompanied by a television film crew, stood outside I.B.M.'s building in Manhattan, his bullhorn aimed toward the office of Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chief executive."
7/7/1994	Japanese Made Gains In June Vehicle Sales	The leading Japanese auto makers posted strong sales and gains in market share in June, driving up total car and light-truck sales for the month despite a weaker performance by the Big Three. Over all, sales sustained the moderate growth they have managed since easing off in May, sticking to a pace that analysts say bodes well for continued slow growth in the economy. Sales of cars and light trucks rose 6.8 percent compared with a strong period a year earlier.
7/7/1994	Ford Sets Higher Prices For Some 1995 Models	"The Ford Motor Company said today that it had notified dealers that it was raising the prices of certain 1995 model cars an average of 1.2 percent over similarly equipped 1994 models, an increase that Ford described as """"less than half the projected rise in the Consumer Price Index."""" Including the addition of new equipment that was previously optional, the base prices of these Ford models will rise 2.2%, on average."
7/2/1994	CAVEAT EMPTOR;A New Home Equity Deal That May Not Be So Sweet	Recognizing the enormous popularity of credit cards with perks, the Ford Motor Company has extended the concept to a home equity loan. On June 20, a unit of Ford's financial services group began mailing 1.5 million  letters to homeowners in 40 states offering a home equity loan that comes with a rebate on the purchase or lease of new Ford, Lincoln or Mercury cars and light trucks. The interest rates will start at 10.25 percent and rise to 13.25 percent for customers with less attractive credit profiles, said Denny P. Hanysak, the president of Ford's consumer finance unit. Loans of $10,000 or more will qualify for an immediate $500 rebate, and an additional rebate of 1 percent of the outstanding home equity loan balance in each year.
7/1/1994	'95 G.M. Prices to Be 2.5% Above Current Levels	The General Motors Corporation said today that it was raising the prices of its 1995 cars and light trucks by an average of 2.5 percent, or $494, above the current prices of its 1994 models.
6/28/1994	Big 3 Look at Natural Gas	The Big Three auto makers plan to announce on Tuesday that they have formed a research partnership to lower the cost of making vehicles powered by natural gas. By 1998 the partnership aims to halve the cost of making the tanks that store natural gas, a popular alternative fuel because it costs less and burns cleaner than gasoline.
6/26/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Celica GT vs. Acura Integra GS-R; Of Running Shoes and Ruby Slippers	DRIVING the new Toyota Celica is like wearing a fine leather dress shoe. You can't run fast in it, and it costs more than other pumps might. But it's supple and sleek, fitting your foot as if it were custom-made. You feel, and look, great. Driving the Acura Integra is like wearing a well-engineered athletic shoe. You can tear up a track. You feel, and look, macho.
6/24/1994	Chrysler and Nissan Top Auto Production Survey	The Chrysler Corporation is the most profitable and lowest-cost maker of automobiles in North America, while the Nissan Motor Company's plants are the most efficient, according to a survey released here today. The General Motors Corporation has improved its efficiency the most, gaining almost 12 percent from a previous study for 1992.
6/21/1994	Japan Gives U.S. Cars a 2d Look	After years of being derided as overpriced, defect-prone gas guzzlers, something unexpected is happening to American cars in Japan. They are starting to win some consumer acceptance. Sales of passenger cars made in the United States by Ford, General Motors and Chrysler more than doubled here in the first five months of this year, compared with the period a year earlier, even as overall car sales declined amid an economic slump. The gains follow a 37 percent increase in Big Three imports to Japan in 1993 from 1992.
6/16/1994	50,000 Orders For New Fords	The chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander J. Trotman, said today that the auto maker already had 50,000 dealer orders for its new Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique compact cars, which go on sale in the United States in September as 1995 models. Ford will start building the cars next month at a plant in Kansas City, Mo., after a $375 million investment there. The cars, which will also be made at a Ford assembly plant in Mexico, replace the smaller and less expensive Tempo and Topaz compacts.
6/10/1994	Ford Offering Right-Drive Cars in Japan	Making an aggressive push into the Japanese market, the Ford Motor Company began sales here today of its first imported cars with right-hand drive. The Japanese, like the British, drive on the left, and Tokyo has often cited the absence of American cars with steering wheels on the right to counter Detroit's complaints that Japan's auto market is closed.
6/8/1994	COMPANY NEWS; PNC Bank In Mortgage Acquisition	Further expanding its fast-growing mortgage-banking business, the PNC Bank Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the $10 billion mortgage-servicing portfolio of the Associates Corporation of North America, a division of the Ford Motor Company. The acquisition, which will put PNC in the top 10 mortgage servicers with a portfolio of $46 billion, is yet another sign of the increasing attractiveness of mortgage servicing as new mortgage loan originations decline. Mortgage servicing is basically the sending of bills and the collection of payments on mortgages.
6/5/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda Accord Station Wagon; Good for People, But Not for Bureaus	TWO of my lesser charms, or so says my wife, are that I am a pack rat and that I am occasionally lazy. As usual, she is half right. It is true that the last thing I threw away was a water bill from 1959. But I am lazy on more than just an occasional basis, a fact reflected by the bottles and cans that fill one of the rooms in our basement.
6/4/1994	It's Not Quite Indy, but Ford Wins an Electric Car Race	Roberta J. Nichols was skeptical. Three states have mandated an imminent future for electric vehicles, but Dr. Nichols, an official with Ford's electric vehicle program, was saying that compliance might be impossible and the strict timetable counterproductive. Then an electric Chrysler mini-van zipped past her.
5/29/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Aspire; The Price (Hold the Extras) Is Right	WHY does one buy an economy car? Not because it is pretty, fun to drive, smooth handling or restfully quiet. And certainly not because it is the safest thing on the road.But because it is, sigh, economical.Yet Ford now gives us the Aspire, which at its bare-bones basic price of $8,240 is the cheapest car sold in America with standard dual air bags. That's great, but add some optional necessities (rear-window defroster, interval wipers) or a few nicer ones (air-conditioning, power steering), and suddenly the Aspire doesn't seem quite so economical.
5/22/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mustang GT vs. Camaro Z28; Topless Style With American Muscle	LEE A. IACOCCA, who was about to leave the top job at the Chrysler Corporation, was shaking his head. This was a couple of years ago, in his sumptuous office in Chrysler's sumptuous New York headquarters, and he was talking about the electric van I had just driven, which didn't work very well. The problem, of course, was the battery technology, ancient and not ready for an unpolluted brave new world in which everyone will drink Perrier and will have stubbed out the final cigarette.
5/21/1994	G.M. Outlines Its Asian Strategy to Shareholders	The General Motors Corporation displayed its strategy today for taking advantage of rapidly expanding Asian markets by building far more cars and trucks there, especially in China. Company executives said that they would begin production in India and Indonesia by the end of the year, and that they were in final negotiations to make mini-vans and subcompact cars in China. These plans, set forth at the company's annual meeting, held here today, mark G.M.'s latest effort to expand its vastly profitable foreign operations even as its North American automotive units pursue the far more modest goal of showing a net profit this year after repeated losses.
5/5/1994	Market Place; Japanese investors bet that Ford will work its magic on Mazda.	INVESTORS in Japan have been placing their bets on the Ford Motor Company in a different way. They are bidding up the shares of Mazda, the ailing Japanese auto maker of which Ford owns about 25 percent. At a time when Japan's auto industry is experiencing its worst slump since World War II, the Mazda Motor Corporation is one of the sickest of the companies. Its sales in Japan last year plunged at twice the rate of the market as a whole. The Hiroshima-based company is expected to report a loss of 45 billion yen, or about $440 million, for the fiscal year that ended March 31, and losses will continue for at least another year or two.
4/30/1994	Ford Posts $904 Million Profit, Highest Since 1989	Rounding out a spate of positive financial news from the nation's auto industry, the Ford Motor Company today reported its best quarterly results since 1989, posting a first-quarter profit of $904 million, or $1.66 a share. That sum, up 58 percent from a year earlier, reflected an extraordinary charge against earnings of $440 million from the sale of First Nationwide Bank, a savings and loan. A year ago, Ford reported a first-quarter profit of $572 million, or $1.02 a share. On Thursday, the General Motors Corporation posted a first-quarter profit of $853.7 million, or 81 cents a share, a 66 percent gain from a year earlier. Last week, the Chrysler Corporation reported a record quarterly profit of $938 million, up 77 percent from a year earlier. Big Gains in U.S. Like the gains at Chrysler and G.M., Ford's improved results stemmed largely from higher United States automotive sales. Ford also gained from a better performance overseas as well as from its financial services group, absent the First Nationwide write-off. On April 14, Ford agreed to sell First Nationwide to First Madison Bank for $1.1 billion.
4/22/1994	Ford Revamps With Eye on the Globe	The Ford Motor Company today announced its most sweeping reorganization in more than 25 years, in a bid to compete better in the coming decades not only in its established European and North American markets, but in the potentially huge car and truck markets developing in Asia. At the end of the year, Ford's North American Operations and Ford of Europe will vanish, merging into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations, with global reach. Ford's Asian-Pacific and Latin American Operations will remain separate at least until the other, more extensive operations are merged, Ford officials said.
4/18/1994	A Mustang And a Boy Named Bill	For a moment today, he was no longer a President isolated in the back seat of a bulletproof limousine. He was Bill Clinton, car-crazy baby boomer, back behind the wheel of his most prized possession, an ice-blue 1967 Mustang convertible. The Mustang was the classic of Mr. Clinton's generation, and today, 30 years to the day after the first Mustang rolled off the assembly line, he was here to claim a share of nostalgia.
4/18/1994	Ride Into Nostalgia	I AM not a lover of mini-vans, although I've been driving one since 1988. It came in handy to haul all the paraphernalia our first child required. Now with a second child, we wonder if we could ever live without one. My lack of affection for mini-vans has nothing to do with the vehicles; they're practical. But in terms of image, I picture myself speeding down the highway in a red Miata roadster. Practicality wins out, however, when it comes to shuttling between Scout meetings, dance classes and T-ball practice.
4/17/1994	BEHIND THE WHEEL;  Ford's New Van on the Block	Casting a strong vote of confidence in the automobile industry's strengthening recovery, the Ford Motor Company plans to increase its dividend for the first time since 1989 and to split its stock 2 for 1. At a meeting today, Ford's directors signed off on an increase in the quarterly cash dividend of 12.5 percent, to 45 cents a share from 40 cents, or 22.5 cents once the stock splits. In 1991, Ford, the nation's No. 2 auto maker, cut the dividend to its current level of 40 cents a quarter from 75 cents.
4/15/1994	Ford Sets 12.5% Rise In Dividend	"Officials of the Chrysler Corporation said today that the company was working on plans to introduce a credit card to match those of two of its rival auto makers, General Motors and Ford, but that there was no timetable for taking action. """"We can be a little bit more deliberate about it,"""" a company spokesman, Jim Crawford, said. He was responding to an article in USA Today saying that Chrysler, the No. 3 auto maker, would issue the card this fall and that it may offer holders more lucrative rebates than G.M. or Ford do."
4/13/1994	Credit Card For Chrysler	"The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it would team with the Fox Broadcasting Company, the Ford Motor Company and more than 250 radio stations across the country for its largest promotion ever, called """"Red Hot Summer."
4/13/1994	Coke Plans 'Red Hot Summer'	The auction of the Ford Motor Company's First Nationwide Bank unit heads into its final days with three bidders in the running. Ford has set Monday night as the deadline for bids for its savings and loan business and will decide next week whether to sell First Nationwide to the Golden West Financial Corporation of Oakland, Calif.; Madison Financial Inc. of Dallas or to a joint effort by the Great Western Financial Corporation, based in Los Angeles, and Lehman Brothers, the investment banking company in New York.
4/9/1994	Ford Auction Of S.& L. Is Near an End	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has upgraded its investigation of a suspected defect in the steering system of 3.4 million Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable and Lincoln Continental sedans built from 1987 to 1993. The Taurus is the nation's best-selling car. Safety investigators are looking at 134 complaints of broken tie rods, which are steel parts that connect the chassis to the wheels. A Ford Motor Company spokesman said that the inquiry was routine, and that the auto maker was unaware of any defect. Ford said it was cooperating with investigators and did not currently plan to recall the cars.
4/8/1994	Inquiry Upgraded on Possible Ford Defect	IT is lightweight, will not rust and is completely recyclable. Sound like an ideal material for a fuel-efficient, durable, environmentally friendly car? Ford Motor thinks so, which is why the company is about to roll out 20 all-aluminum Mercury Sables for road tests. Ford wants to determine the feasibility of mass producing aluminum cars that would cost about the same as conventional steel models.
4/3/1994	Technology; Aluminum Is Put To the Test by Ford	Japan announced today that it would discontinue its voluntary restraints on exports of automobiles to the United States when its fiscal year ends on Thursday. The restrictions, an example of what is now called managed trade, were begun in 1981, at a time when American car makers were reeling from Japanese competition. But the end of the program comes as Detroit's Big Three have narrowed the quality gap with Japan and are gaining more of the American market.
3/29/1994	Japan to End Restraints on Auto Exports to U.S.	Investors who were counting on the Big Three auto makers to pay generous common stock dividends after regaining healthy balance sheets could be disappointed in this season of prosperity in Detroit. Despite recent increases in sales and cash flow, which have propelled the common stocks of Ford, Chrysler and General Motorsto new highs, several auto industry analysts expect auto makers to increase dividends more conservatively than has been their custom.
3/22/1994	FORD SAID TO CONSIDER OFFERS FOR FINANCIAL UNIT	The Ford Motor Company is considering offers from three savings and loan institutions -- two based in California and one in Texas -- to buy its unprofitable First Nationwide Financial Corporation, officials close to the negotiations said yesterday.
3/4/1994	Bullish Chrysler Moves To Beef Up Auto Plants	The Chrysler Corporation, bullish about its long-term prospects after introducing several highly acclaimed new car and truck models, said today that it would spend $1.8 billion over three years to increase its manufacturing capacity by 17 percent. Chrysler's move could be among the first of many in spirited jockeying among the Big Three auto makers to capitalize on rising vehicle sales -- particularly of sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans -- over the next two to three years. The Ford Motor Company has been trying to squeeze extra capacity from its assembly lines, especially for its hot-selling utility vehicles and light trucks, and the General Motors Corporation recently announced actions to increase truck capacity. Thousands of New Jobs Chrysler said it was undertaking a series of actions, including canceling its plans to shut down one of its two assembly plants near St. Louis. Over all, Chrysler will increase its worldwide vehicle-making capacity to 3.5 million units a year from about 3 million currently. The increase is expected to generate as many as 6,000 jobs in the United States and Canada, the auto maker said. Some jobs will go to laid-off union members but at least several thousand new workers will be hired.
3/4/1994	Surpassing Predictions, Vehicle Sales Jump 19.8%	Automotive sales shot up 19.8 percent last month, compared with February of last year, exceeding even the optimistic expectations of industry executives, forecasters, retailers and Wall Street analysts. Sales of light trucks were particularly strong as the Big Three auto makers capitalized on their advantages over Japanese competitors in mini-vans, pickups and sport-utility vehicles. But the strong sales, combined with recent price increases by the auto makers, could provoke further moves by the Federal Reserve to ward off inflation.
3/1/1994	Ford Motor Creates a Group To Pursue Ventures in China	The Ford Motor Company, seeking to increase its presence in China's nascent automotive market, has formed a new unit to concentrate on that country and has named a senior executive to run it. The new group, Ford China Operations, will be responsible for negotiating joint ventures, component manufacturing and possibly vehicle assembly. Ford expects to announce a joint venture soon for the manufacture of automotive glass in China, a company spokesman said today. The auto maker is also interested in establishing vehicle assembly, possibly as a joint venture with a Chinese company.
2/19/1994	G.M. Gets an Award From Ford	The General Motors Corporation's Saginaw steering gear division has been cited for high quality and productivity by an unlikely source -- the Ford Motor Company. G.M. said its Plant 21 in Athens, Ala., had been given the Ford Q1 Preferred Quality Award for steering pumps that the plant supplied to Ford. The Q1 Award is given to suppliers that Ford says demonstrate commitment to continuous improvement in quality and productivity.
2/12/1994	Detroit's New Wrinkle: Leasing of Used Cars	"IN the old days financing a new car was relatively simple. Then came lease contracts, with jargon like """"residual value"""" and warnings in fine print about """"mileage limitations"""" and """"normal wear and tear."""" The latest wrinkle, announced earlier this month by the Ford Motor Company, is the leasing of low-mileage used cars. The practice is reminiscent of the move by dealers a few years ago to sell """"almost new"""" cars, which had spent a few months as rental cars, for substantially less than new models."
2/10/1994	In Record Turnaround, Ford Had $2.5 Billion Profit in 1993	Underscoring the domestic automotive industry's recovery, the Ford Motor Company today reported the biggest year-to-year financial turnaround in its history, posting a profit of $2.5 billion for 1993. The rebound, driven by Ford's growing auto sales in the United States and record profits from financial services, represented more than a $3 billion swing from the 1992 loss of $502 million, excluding one-time gains and charges. Revenue grew 8.4 percent in 1993, to $108.5 billion.
2/6/1994	Will the Big 3 Stay on the Road To Success?	"WHAT a difference a recovery can make in Detroit. Only yesterday, it seems, the Big Three chiefs and President Bush flew to Tokyo complaining about """"getting our brains beaten in,"""" to use Lee Iacocca's vivid expression. Today the Big Three, exemplified by Chrysler's stunning turnaround, are selling cars almost as fast as they can build them. With improved American quality and Japan's higher prices, Detroit's models indeed represent superior value, a claim that is finally holding water."
2/4/1994	Auto Sales Jumped 13.8% Last Month	United States automotive sales surged 13.8 percent in January, despite the effects of the Los Angeles earthquake and severe winter weather, suggesting that the demand for new cars and light trucks is outpacing bullish forecasts. Car buyers seem to be moving up their purchases of new cars faster than auto makers and economists had expected. The reasons for this are the high average age of cars and trucks on the road, as well as increases in employment, personal income and consumer confidence.
1/28/1994	Ford Plans Lease Program for Used Cars	The Ford Motor Company is hammering out the details of a program to lease used Ford vehicles through its dealers. The auto maker said it might announce the plan within a week. Tom Rhoades, a spokesman for Ford, said the program, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal, was in the works.
1/16/1994	After a 15-Year Run, the Old Mustang Yields to a Fresh Colt	MADONNA was jogging when she spotted the car, so she stopped by. Larry Hagman, breakfasting instead of acting, also noticed, and he came out for a look. And Ross Roberts was there at Tavern on the Green in Central Park, too, although that was less surprising. Roberts is the head of Ford Division, and he was trotting out the company's new Mustang, an important replacement for the long-of-tooth car whose previous incarnation hadn't really changed since it first appeared as a 1979 model.
1/14/1994	NISSAN TO SELL FORDS IN JAPAN AND MOVE SENTRA TO U.S.	The Nissan Motor Company said early today in Tokyo that its largest dealer was planning to sell cars made by the Ford Motor Company in the Tokyo area. Tokyo Nissan, a dealer in which Nissan owns a 25 percent stake, is now talking with Ford, a Nissan spokesman said. In 1992, Nissan pledged to sell 3,000 Ford cars a year through its dealers in Japan. But nothing came of the pledge, partly because Ford wanted to concentrate its sales through Autorama, a Japanese dealer network it owns with the Mazda Motor Company.
1/11/1994	Ford Ousts Driver Who Praised Rival	The Ford Motor Company has dismissed a test driver who praised a pickup truck built by the Chrysler Corporation in a recent newspaper article. Ford said the worker had a history of absences and was unwilling to work seven days a week. The driver, Roland Davis, said he had worked for Ford from Jan. 19, 1993, until he was discharged on Wednesday, the first day he was asked to report to the test track since the article appeared in The New York Times on Dec. 21.
1/11/1994	FORD RAISES PRICES ON 1994 MODEL CARS AND TRUCKS	The Ford Motor Company raised prices on 11 car and 6 truck lines yesterday, resulting in an average price increase of five-tenths of a percent, or $97 a vehicle. Truck price increases average between $50 and $280 a vehicle, Ford said. Ford is the second of the Big Three auto makers to raise prices for the 1994-model year, which began on Oct. 1. The General Motors Corporation raised its United States car prices an average eight-tenths of a percent, or $164, as of Jan. 3. G.M. truck prices were increased six-tenths of a percent, or $131.
1/5/1994	Auto Makers' Sales Rose 8.4% in 1993	The American auto industry finished 1993 on a strong note with sales in December roughly 5 percent ahead of 1992 levels and overall sales for the year up about 8.4 percent. Several foreign manufacturers, including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, had not finished tallying their numbers late today, preventing an exact accounting. However, sales analysts at the Ford Motor Company estimated total industry sales of 8.6 million cars for 1993 and 5.6 million light trucks for a total of 14.2 million vehicles, the best year since 1989 and up from 13.1 million in 1992.
1/2/1994	Hey, Rusty Wallace and Roger Penske, Have You Driven a Ford Lately?	If you want to pinpoint the allegiance of stock-car fans, the standards of longitude and latitude are easy. First, ask whether they love or hate Dale Earnhardt. Then, determine whether they are Ford or Chevy fans. The Earnhardt polarity is understandable. His intimidating driving style has been compared to the Oakland version of Raider football.
12/28/1993	Mazda Gives Ford Motor More Control	With its losses growing and its basic strategy gone awry, the Mazda Motor Corporation today made what would have been an unthinkable announcement for a major Japanese auto maker just a few years ago: It said it was ceding more control to its largest shareholder, the Ford Motor Company, and that it expected Ford to help shape its future. Ford has owned nearly 25 percent of Mazda for 14 years, and the two have a number of ventures focusing on production of specific models, like the Ford Probe and Mazda pickup trucks. But today's announcement, which caught analysts by surprise, appeared to go far beyond the old arrangement.
12/17/1993	Ford to Build New Compacts At U.S. and Mexican Plants	"Eager to expand its production capacity and exploit the favorable regulations under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Ford Motor Company said today that it would build its new compact cars in Mexico, as well as the United States, and greatly increase its exports to Mexico. Ford's plans will touch off a series of production shifts in Mexican, Canadian and American factories, the company said, resulting in the creation of the equivalent of 550 jobs in the United States and Canada, and 300 jobs in Mexico. Ford projected that the total number of jobs, or """"job equivalents,"""" could climb to 6,000 when additional work at its suppliers' plants in the United States and Canada was taken into account, as well as overtime work."
12/13/1993	Ford Will Build Cars for Export	The Ford Motor Company will begin building right-hand-drive versions of its Probe coupe for export this week, the first time since the early 1900's that it has produced a vehicle in the United States with the steering wheel on the right side.
12/7/1993	Big 3 Offer Compromise, Promising Cleaner Cars	In a plan that would sidestep a requirement for electric cars in the Northeast, the Big Three American auto makers proposed a compromise on pollution standards yesterday. General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler offered to produce gasoline-powered cars that would be cleaner than the ones the Federal Government plans to require. But such vehicles would not be as clean as those that meet California's stricter emission standards, which New York and Massachusetts have adopted and other states are considering.
12/4/1993	Ford's European Operations Chief to Retire	The Ford Motor Company said today that William H. Fike would retire as president of its troubled European operations at the end of the year and that his position would be eliminated. The announcement followed reports that Mr. Fike, 57, was being recalled to the United States because Ford's top management was unhappy with Ford of Europe's financial performance. The subsidiary had losses of $1.3 billion in 1992 and $711 million in 1991. David Healy, an S. G. Warburg & Company analyst, estimated that Ford of Europe would show a loss of about $500 million for 1993.
11/16/1993	Reshaping Mexico's Auto Future	Of all the Mexican businesses that would be reshaped by a North American Free Trade Agreement, none is more likely to undergo a transformation than the automotive industry. In that sector, a trade accord may well alter the way cars are made and sold on both sides of the border. For Mexico, the stakes are high. Cars are its biggest export business after oil, employing 60,000 people directly and more than 300,000 indirectly in parts manufacturing and distribution. Together, the Chrysler Corporation, the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation, Nissan and Volkswagen built more than a million cars in Mexico last year, making it one of just a few developing countries in the world to reach that mark.
11/13/1993	Ford Salaried Workers Get Raise	Thanks in part to the improving fortunes of the Ford Motor Company, its salaried workers will get raises averaging 5 percent in 1994 and benefits that shrank in recent leaner years will be restored to previous levels, the company announced today. The changes are similar to the white-collar wage and benefit package announced Thursday by the General Motors Corporation.
11/2/1993	Lear Buys Ford Unit	The Lear Seating Corporation, a subsidiary of Lear Holdings Inc., said today that it had completed the previously announced purchase of most of the Ford Motor Company's Favesa S.A. de C.V. automotive seating and seat trim operations. Terms of the sale were not disclosed. Annual sales of Favesa were estimated at $600 million, Lear said. Lear and Ford announced an agreement on the sale in August. Included in the transaction are five Ford plants in Juarez, Mexico, which employ about 6,085 workers. The sale leaves Ford with one major seat and interior trim plant in the United States.
10/28/1993	Ford Reports a $463 Million Profit for 3d Quarter	With profits in the United States at their highest level for the period since 1988, the Ford Motor Company today posted third-quarter earnings of $463 million, in contrast to a loss of $272 million during the quarter last year. While Ford's stock surged immediately after the announcement, it receded a bit after Wall Street analysts looked more closely at the numbers. In addition to a one-time favorable tax adjustment of $140 million, Ford's profits were buoyed by sales in Latin America, a market that some analysts consider too volatile to support investors' hopes for future prosperity. Other analysts worried that Ford was continuing to cut the profit margins on its vehicles too fine.
10/25/1993	Auto Workers Gain Contract With G.M. Increasing Pensions	The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers tentatively agreed early this morning to a three-year labor contract that raises wages, enriches pensions and preserves health care benefits that are fully paid by the company. The agreement, reached at 1 A.M. after a 16-hour bargaining session, hews to the pattern negotiated at the Ford Motor Company five weeks ago, the president of the union, Owen F. Bieber, announced. The Chrysler Corporation agreed to a similar contract on Oct. 1.
10/24/1993	Viewpoints; With a Rare Opportunity, Ford Blew It	THIS is a story about what is wrong with American business. After five years and an investment of $3 billion, the Ford Motor Company introduced its new Taurus/Sable midsize cars in late 1985. With their radically aerodynamic shape, neatly functional dashboards of German austerity and highly advanced engineering, the new cars looked different from all other offerings. And they were.
10/24/1993	IDEAS & TRENDS: A Genteel Conspiracy Theory; Is It Just Possible That Ford Wants to Beat G.M.?	TO hear normally buttoned-up auto industry analysts sound like conspiracy buffs surveying the grassy knoll, ask them this: Is the Ford Motor Company quietly trying to overtake the hobbled General Motors Corporation and become the No. 1 automaker in the United States? Odd that the question should have to be asked. In other industries, companies like Pepsi, Avis, Apple and United make no bones about their eagerness to knock off the big guy. But one of the peculiar aspects of relations among the Big Three automakers is that they are publicly quite genteel. Perhaps because they focus their hostility on the Japanese, no one here talks much about crushing the domestic competition and becoming No. 1.
10/22/1993	No Settlement, or Deadline, For G.M. and Auto Workers	The delicate labor contract negotiations between the United Automobile Workers union, which is trying to preserve an industrywide pact, and the General Motors Corporation, which is pressing for concessions, have reached a strangely upbeat standoff with no agreement but also no strike deadline. Both sides have been predicting an imminent settlement for a week. So far, G.M. has agreed to most of the basic package of wages and benefits in the pattern-setting contract negotiated with the Ford Motor Company last month, Owen F. Bieber, the U.A.W. president, told union leaders today in a closed meeting. But G.M. is still haggling over two expensive and complex issues: pension benefits and job security funds.
10/19/1993	He's Driven One Lately	"To the Editor: You do readers a disservice and mislead by criticizing the new chairman and the former chairman of Ford Motor Company for not owning cars (""""Blissful Ignorance in Detroit,"""" editorial, Oct. 8). You incorrectly imply that they are not familiar with the problems of buying, owning and getting a car serviced just because they don't own one."
10/17/1993	Don't Lay the Burden of Health Care Reform on Small Business; Good for Big Business	"To the Editor: Re """"Business Leaders Voice Skepticism on Health Plan"""" (news article, Oct. 8): Although all of us don't agree with every detail in President Clinton's plan, we believe he deserves great credit for his bold effort finally to bring health care reform to the United States. Additionally, we believe there is much in the plan that is good for American competitiveness."
10/16/1993	Ford Reaches Accord on U.A.W. Pact	The Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union have settled a last-minute dispute about a holiday provision in their new labor pact, and now plan to sign the contract, officials on both sides said today. The agreement clears the way for negotiators to wrap up industry bargaining at the General Motors Corporation, where the union has been seeking to replicate the pattern contract it negotiated at Ford last month. G.M. appears likely to accept the basic package of wages and benefits, with some modifications.
10/14/1993	At the Wire, U.A.W. Balks On Ford Pact	Two hours before they were to formally sign a three-year contract negotiated last month with the Ford Motor Company, top officials of the United Automobile Workers union notified Ford that they were unhappy with the company's view of one provision and would not sign. Ford officials said they were caught off guard Tuesday night by the union's objection, which deals with a section giving workers a four-day weekend around Independence Day. Ford and the union had scheduled a signing ceremony at 10 A.M. today, which they called off at 8 A.M. No new date for signing the agreement was scheduled. No Longer Settled It was a highly unusual, perhaps unprecedented, move by the U.A.W., since the Ford agreement had already been ratified by the union's members at the No. 2 auto maker by a 2-to-1 margin, and the union had publicly treated it as a done deal. Furthermore, the U.A.W. is now locked in negotiations with the General Motors Corporation.
10/11/1993	Essay; Son Of Synfuels	Who is the most powerful business executive in the United States today? She is Dr. Mary Good, President Clinton's Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, who has quietly been designated czar of the U.S. automobile industry. The heads of her divisions -- G.M., Ford and Chrysler -- are delighted with the Government's friendly takeover. These newly middle managers no longer bear responsibility for R.& D., can relax about antitrust, and can forget about the old competition among one another and from abroad. Fatigued by the stress of capitalist risk? Dr. Good will see you now.
10/8/1993	Blissful Ignorance in Detroit	Neither the next chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander J. Trotman, nor the man he is to replace, Harold A. Poling, owns an automobile. They drive company cars. This revelation does not explain Detroit's slump in the 1970's, nor its buoyant comeback in the 1990's. But it bespeaks an alarming indifference to one of the basics of consumer research -- namely, to know something about consumers, it helps to be one. For those unfortunates who don't have a company car, here's how it works. You get a new one every year. If it goes on the fritz, another one magically appears. You never have to visit a showroom, haggle with a dealer or face the awful truth that what you thought would be a simple tune-up is, in fact, a $500 transmission job.
10/7/1993	New Ford Chief Hasn't Bought One, Lately	The next chairman, president and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, a man with the ultimate responsibility for making and selling more than three million vehicles a year, does not own a car. Alexander J. Trotman, who will assume his new responsibilities next month, cannot remember the last time he bought a car, Ford or otherwise. While he has bought cars overseas, he has never had the experience of buying from an American dealer, haggling over price and trade-ins, or fussing with matters like auto insurance or registration.
10/5/1993	English-Born Auto Planner Will Be New Ford Chairman	Alexander J. Trotman, an English-born car and truck planner who spent most of his career with the Ford Motor Company overseas, will become chairman and chief executive on Nov. 1, replacing Harold A. Poling, who is retiring, Mr. Poling announced today. Mr. Trotman, now president and chief operating officer of Ford's worldwide automotive group, will also hold the post of president of the company, which is now unoccupied.
9/30/1993	AUTO UNION WORKERS APPROVE NEW CONTRACT WITH FORD	Hourly workers at the Ford Motor Company approved the three-year labor contract negotiated by the United Automobile Workers and Ford two weeks ago. About 67 percent of workers voted for the agreement -- a narrower margin of victory than in many past settlements. Some workers said they were unhappy that the contract reduces starting wages for new hires and extends the length of time it takes for them to reach the full wage level. The U.A.W. is negotiating a similar contract with the Chrysler Corporation against a strike deadline of 11:59 P.M. today.
9/29/1993	Washington Joins Big 3 Auto Venture	"The White House and the Big Three auto companies will announce today a radical new approach to car technology and Government-industry relations, under which Washington will give Detroit technology that originated in weapons programs, and Detroit will strive to build a car that goes three times farther than current models on the same amount of fuel. Washington is already working with the auto makers on various technologies, but the new agreement, to be announced at a White House ceremony with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and the chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, will set a unifying 10-year goal: very high fuel economy that far exceeds the regulatory requirements. 'Rewriting the Book' """"We think it's an enormous breakthrough,"""" Mr. Gore said of the partnership in a telephone interview last night. """"The goal has been consciously set at a point that lies beyond what we know how to do with current systems."
9/29/1993	Jaguar Recapitalized	The Ford Motor Company has recapitalized Jaguar, its British luxury auto subsidiary, by investing $:300 million ($450 million), The Financial Times reported today. As a result of Jaguar's continuing heavy losses, $:180 million of intercompany debt was transformed into equity to strengthen its balance sheet. Jaguar is likely to increase output to 29,000 cars this year from 22,500 last year, the newspaper said.
9/27/1993	Ford Sets Its Sights on a 'World Car'	With their sleek contours and high-tech features, the cars rolling off the production line at the Ford plant here would never be mistaken for a Model T. Yet they represent the most ambitious effort so far by the American auto industry to accomplish what Japanese auto makers -- and Volkswagen with the Beetle -- have done in the decades since the Ford Motor Company's Model T epitomized mass production: design a car that can be built and sold in pretty much the same form all over the world.
9/21/1993	U.A.W. Sights Are Now Set On Bargaining at Chrysler	Having negotiated a tentative three-year labor contract with the Ford Motor Company, the United Automobile Workers will seek to replicate it at the Chrysler Corporation before moving on to the industry's financially troubled giant, the General Motors Corporation, Owen F. Bieber, the president of the U.A.W., said today. The decision was expected, because if the U.A.W. locks up agreements with both Chrysler and Ford, it will have greater bargaining leverage with G.M., which is expected to put up the biggest fight to alter the agreement to suit its needs.
9/18/1993	Health Cost Payment in Ford Pact	The tentative labor contract negotiated this week between the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union contains a provision under which workers would forgo a small portion of their wage increases partly to help pay for their health care. According to one estimate, the change could be worth about $180 million to Ford over the life of the three-year contract, and $400 million to the General Motors Corporation should a comparable provision be negotiated there. Last year, Ford spent $1.5 billion on health care for its blue-collar workers.
9/17/1993	Detroit Seeks to Monitor Japan's U.S. Auto Sales	Detroit's Big Three auto makers have quietly asked the Clinton Administration to set up an elaborate system for monitoring the prices and sales of cars and trucks imported from Japan and are threatening to seek steep tariffs on the imports if the Administration turns them down, three people involved in the issue said today. The auto industry's request is the latest step in Detroit's yearlong effort to win Government help against Japanese competition. The latest request is based on the rapid appreciation this year of the yen, which gives the industry a fresh argument to try to win tariffs on imports by filing complaints with the Commerce Department.
9/17/1993	For Ford, a New Contract but Little New Ground	Abandoning efforts to frame a fundamentally different agreement with the United Automobile Workers, the Ford Motor Company reached a tentative three-year contract with the union late on Wednesday that increases wages and preserves benefits, including health care fully paid by the auto maker. The few changes appeared more likely to benefit Ford than the industry's ailing giant, the General Motors Corporation, with which the U.A.W. will seek a similar agreement in coming weeks.
9/17/1993	An Idea Whose Time May Have Passed	In reaching a tentative agreement on Wednesday night that calls for lower wages for new workers, the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers are turning to a cost-saving measure that seems to have fallen out of favor recently among management and labor negotiators in other industries. When it came to prominence in the airline and supermarket businesses a decade ago, the two-tier wage system was hailed by some companies as an innovation that would allow them to maintain or expand work forces more cheaply. It allowed unions to make concessions without hurting current members.
9/16/1993	U.A.W and Ford Agree on New Contract	The United Automobile Workers union reached a tentative agreement late tonight with the Ford Motor Company on a new three-year labor contract, successfully fighting off the company's efforts to force workers to pay more out of their own pockets for health care. The agreement, which came nearly 24 hours after the old contract expired, was announced after a round-the-clock negotiating session. The union had authorized a strike but chose to continue negotiating after the contract expired.
9/16/1993	The Edsel is back, though on a smaller scale, and so is the over-hype that preceded the car in 1957.	"DESTINED for automotive history."""" """"A breed apart."
9/15/1993	U.A.W. and Ford Bargain Past Deadline for a Strike	Unable to resolve issues that have dogged labor negotiations for months, leaders of the United Automobile Workers continued talking with the Ford Motor Company early today as they passed a midnight deadline, rather than striking its plants. For days, union and company officials had predicted they would sign a new labor agreement before the deadline. But in a marathon session on Tuesday negotiators found they still could not agree on answers to such thorny questions as how to control health care costs, how long the contract should run and how to preserve and create more jobs at Ford.
9/15/1993	Shifting Burdens: Business and the Health Plan - A special report.; Companies Big and Small Tally Effects of Clinton Health Plan	President Clinton's plan for reshaping the health care system would cause a vast shift in financial burdens among American corporations. Health costs would ease for companies, most of them manufacturers, that now offer generous benefits, and rise for those that do not, among them not only small neighborhood shops but also corporate giants like Wal-Mart, Sears and Wendy's. How those burdens would be reapportioned emerges from a look at insurance costs and prospects at four companies representing the variety of corporate experiences: Ford Motor Company, an older manufacturer; Apple Computer, a young high-tech company; Lehigh Valley Racquet and Fitness Centers, a small Pennsylvania business that uses part-time instructors, and Manpower Inc., the nation's biggest supplier of temporary workers.
9/15/1993	FORD TO EXTEND BUYER REBATES ON SOME '94 MODELS	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would extend buyer rebates to some 1994-model cars and trucks. The offer expires on Jan. 10. In many cases, however, the rebate is lower.
9/14/1993	Both Sides Voice Optimism About Avoiding Ford Strike	With the deadline closing in on them, officials on both sides continued to predict today that the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union would sign a new labor contract by Tuesday night, avoiding a strike. Even if they miss the deadline, which falls at 11:59 P.M. Tuesday, negotiators are likely to continue talking, officials said, since they have not reached an impasse.
9/14/1993	Retirees Figure Big in Detroit Math	If one man reflects the hopes of the nation's automobile workers and the fears of its auto makers as they haggle over this year's labor contract, he could well be J. D. Dotson. Mr. Dotson, 92, has richly enjoyed himself since retiring from the General Motors Corporation in 1967. Come hunting season, he still bags his limit of deer, or at least claims to. He still travels, to northern Michigan or to visit his son in Los Angeles.
9/13/1993	Both Sides Optimistic on Talks at Ford	Officials of the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers said today that they expected to avoid a strike and sign a new contract by the time the current one expires just before midnight on Tuesday. Some issues, such as how the company and union will rein in health care costs, remain unresolved. But officials on both sides said such lingering differences were not unusual for the bargaining process, in which the top negotiators sit down in the final hours of the old agreement, weigh the results of bargaining by subcommittees on specific issues and begin the serious horse-trading.
9/12/1993	Conversations/Douglas A. Fraser; He Always Gets Restless When the Union Is Bargaining	"THEY have no sense of strategy!"""" thunders Douglas A. Fraser, former president of the United Automobile Workers and a skilled negotiator, watching the Big Three negotiate new three-year labor contracts with auto workers in this country and Canada. The immediate object of his ire is his longtime employer, the Chrysler Corporation, which, he argues, frittered away a precious bargaining chip by announcing before negotiations began that it would expand a plant in Canada."
9/6/1993	Auto Talks Hang on Health Costs But Workers Are Loath to Chip In	Since learning last year that he had multiple sclerosis, Andy Torok has become less and less steady on his feet, and his worries have accumulated along with the hand prints on his apartment's white walls. But as Mr. Torok has shuttled among specialists, sampling different steroids and undergoing test after test, he has not had to give a single thought to how much his health care costs.
9/3/1993	Chrysler Is Union Target In Canada	The Canadian Automobile Workers today selected the Chrysler Corporation as the lead company in negotiating a new labor contract, which will then serve as a pattern in bargaining with the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation. The decision was expected by automobile executives and union leaders here, since the popularity of the L/H cars and mini-vans that Chrysler makes in Canada gives the union greater leverage in bargaining than it would have with the other companies. Anxious to keep the production lines humming, Chrysler may prove more willing than Ford or G.M. to accede to the demands of the union, which include more paid holidays, better pensions and higher wages.
9/2/1993	Honda to Hold Base Price on Accord Model	Honda is maintaining the base price of its new 1994 Accord family sedan at $14,330 -- the same as the current model -- which could provoke protectionist pressure by the Big Three auto makers, which say they expect Japanese car makers to raise prices to reflect the stronger yen. Preparing to defend against possible attacks by Detroit's auto makers, Honda executives and engineers here explained today how they cut costs to avoid a price increase on the stripped-down Accord, modestly raised prices on other models and still expect to remain profitable.
9/2/1993	CONTRACT WITH FORD LIFTS CODE-ALARM'S STOCK PRICE	The stock of Code-Alarm Inc. surged almost 21 percent after the company announced that it had signed a contract worth more than $21 million with the Ford Motor Company. Shares in the car- and home-security company closed up $1.75 yesterday, to $10.25, after hitting $10.75, a 52-week high.
8/31/1993	Union Settles on Ford as Target in Contract Talks	"The United Automobile Workers union picked the Ford Motor Company today to be the lead company in negotiating a new basic labor contract with the Big Three auto makers. In choosing the No. 2 auto maker over the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation, the union settled on the financially strongest American auto maker, indicating that it has little interest in giving back gains it has made on issues like health care benefits and job security. That is bad news for G.M., which is in worse shape than Ford and had hoped to lead the negotiations, a position that might have allowed it to tailor the industry's contract to reduce its own burdens. Resistance Expected at G.M. Indeed, the selection of Ford caused some analysts today to predict that G.M., which can ill afford the new pension benefits or job-security provisions the union wants, will resist significant parts of whatever Ford and the union hammer out. That could make it more difficult for the union to preserve its """"pattern bargaining"""" tradition, and perhaps provoke a strike at G.M."
8/30/1993	Auto Union Set to Aim at One of Big Three	Douglas A. Fraser, the former president of the United Automobile Workers, vividly remembers the moment his union discovered it could no longer squeeze more money and benefits out of the nation's auto makers by playing one off another during contract negotiations. It was 1958, and the auto makers were presenting their three-year contract proposals to the union in different locations at the same time.
8/29/1993	Technology; One Car, Worldwide, With Strings Pulled From Michigan	"WHEN the Ford Motor Company rolls out its new Ford Contour and the sibling Mercury Mystique this fall, the cars will have the same engines and drive trains found in Ford's new European model, the Mondeo. Ford sees this """"world car"""" approach to design as the key to the company's future -- though it expects the next global project to cost nothing near the $6 billion it poured into developing the Mondeo family."
8/27/1993	Honda's Star Gets Another Sequel	Since January, when the Ford Taurus eclipsed the Honda Accord as the nation's best-selling car model, the auto industry has been waiting for Honda's counterpunch, the new Accord. The first public demonstration of that model takes place Wednesday at a Honda assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. Even rivals concede that the Accord has been the benchmark against which family sedans are measured, raising this question: Can the Accord do it again?
8/26/1993	Ford Offers Union a Contract Plan	Leading off for the Big Three auto makers, the Ford Motor Company offered a 15-page contract proposal to the United Automobile Workers union today that addressed the concerns of the company, from controlling health care costs to freeing Ford to buy more components from nonunion plants. While saying the negotiators were making significant progress, Ernest Lofton, the vice president of the U.A.W. who leads the union team at Ford, received the proposal coolly.
8/26/1993	BUDGET PLANS TO RENT U.S.-MADE CARS IN MOSCOW	Budget Rent a Car plans to open two locations in Moscow next month that will rent cars made in the United States by the Ford Motor Company. The locations, owned and operated by the AM-MOS Corporation of New York, will be at the terminal of Moscow International Airport and at a separate site in southwest Moscow. Additional locations in Moscow are planned, as well as locations in the Russian cities of St. Petersburg and Kiev in 1994 and 1995, Budget said yesterday. Budget's initial rental fleet will consist of 50 Ford vehicles, including Lincoln luxury cars, as well as the Ford Taurus and Tempo, Aerostar van and Explorer sport-utility vehicle. The Hertz Corporation and Avis Inc. have each had rental locations in Russia for several years, but they offer only European-made vehicles.
8/24/1993	Cars That Are Not Are Hot	"The Big Three's singular ray of sunshine these days comes from the mushrooming popularity of noncar cars: the pickups, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles that are classified by the Government as """"trucks"""" for purposes of energy and safety regulations. Because trucks are one of the few segments that Japanese rivals have been slow to exploit and because they are more profitable than cars, Detroit's auto makers are devoting ever more money and thought to developing them and to thinking about the reasons they are so popular."
8/24/1993	FORD IS TRYING OUT A NEW LONG-TERM LEASE PROGRAM	The Ford Motor Company is testing a new long-term leasing program that would give customers a new vehicle to use every two years during the 12-year period of the lease, a trade publication said. The program, intended to preserve brand loyalty, would fix monthly payments at the same rate through 2005 and would allow customers to drive away the sixth vehicle at the end of the lease without any additional payment, Automotive News reported yesterday.
8/2/1993	Big Three Tell Labor the Glass Is Half Empty	When General Motors, Ford and Chrysler last week collectively reported profits of $2.34 billion for the second quarter, they found themselves walking a tightrope. The Big Three want to persuade bankers and investors that they have cut costs and capitalized on the recovering demand for automobiles and that their recession-ravaged treasuries are on the mend. At the same time, auto executives must persuade the United Automobile Workers union, with which they are negotiating new contracts, that the glass is still more than half empty.
7/29/1993	Net Surges At Chrysler And Ford	Providing more evidence of the strong rebound in auto sales, the Ford Motor Company reported today that its earnings had doubled in the second quarter, while the Chrysler Corporation said its profit was nearly four times the level of a year ago. Ford and Chrysler each benefited from the recovering automotive demand in North America. But Ford, which relies heavily on overseas operations, said it lost money in Europe, where auto sales were off drastically from a year ago. Chrysler, which does not have significant European operations, escaped the negative impact of Europe's weak economy. Earnings Meet Forecasts The General Motors Corporation, the largest auto maker in the world, is expected to announce improved earnings on Thursday but, like Ford, will almost certainly be hurt by poor sales in Europe. The three principal nonautomotive subsidiaries of G.M. posted healthy earnings reports today.
7/29/1993	Ford Plant in Poland	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would invest $50 million in building a plant in Poland to produce car seat covers and create up to 1,000 jobs. The plant will produce about 1.1 million covers by 1995. The covers will be exported to Ford's car plants or the company's car seat suppliers, and used by the fall of 1994 for the Escort and Orion models and in 1995 for the Fiesta, Ford said.
7/27/1993	Detroit Pushes Leasing but May Pay Later	Over the last century Detroit has pushed durability, tailfins and apple pie to persuade Americans to buy new cars. But now the nation's auto makers are enjoying their first surge in sales after three bleak years thanks in part to a fresh approach: persuading Americans not to buy at all. Instead of buying, the companies argue, their customers should lease -- paying for the value of the car they use up over two to three years, then returning it to lease a new one. For the consumer, they say, leasing means no fat cash payments in lean times and no aging hulks depreciating -- without warranty -- in the driveway. Leases Get Popular For the manufacturers and dealers, it means brisk business at last, as Americans in growing numbers seize the offer.
7/25/1993	New Life for an Old Critter	I WAS going to say that the latest car to come trotting my way was a new Ford Mustang, but then I realized that that wasn't right. Aside from being a cheap play on words, the car actually came galloping with a great amount of thunder. But that doesn't quite work either. No, this thing came snarling. Unfortunately, snarling is out, too. I have owned both horses and Fords, and none of them snarled. Slithered, that's what.
7/14/1993	Big 3 Rebuffed on Minivans	Detroit's Big Three auto makers lost another round today in their attempt to convince trade officials that the Japanese were selling minivans below cost in the United States. The United States Court of International Trade, which serves as an appeals tribunal in trade issues, rejected arguments by the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation that Japanese manufacturers had inflicted financial harm on them by selling minivans at less than fair market value, which is called dumping.
7/9/1993	FORD TO OPEN TECHNICAL CENTER NEAR TOKYO	The Ford Motor Company plans to open a $50 million technical center near Tokyo by mid-1995 to bolster its efforts to sell more American-made parts to the Japanese auto industry. Construction of the Ford Technology Development Center will start next year; the center will employ about 80 people.
6/21/1993	Market Place; Sluggish European Sales Affect the Big 3 in Different Ways	UNFORTUNATELY for investors in American auto stocks, the budding automotive recovery in the United States has been undercut somewhat by a prostrate European market. The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company depend heavily on earnings from Europe, while the Chrysler Corporation has little manufacturing there and minimal exports. Not surprisingly, the stocks of G.M. and Ford have been penalized by the European market, while the strongly performing Chrysler shares have not.
6/17/1993	FORD MOTOR UNIT LAYS OFF 680 WORKERS IN MEXICO	The Ford Motor Company de Mexico has laid off 680 auto workers from its Cuautitlan plant on the outskirts of Mexico City, company officials said. The plant, which employs 5,200, makes Cougar, Thunderbird, Grand Marquis and Topaz models for the Mexican market.
6/15/1993	Promotion at Ford	The Ford Motor Company announced today that John A. Hall had been elected vice president for employee relations, succeeding J. Craig Hausman, who will retire at the end of the year. Mr. Hall will immediately assume the responsibilities of the position, and Mr. Hausman will go on special assignment to study employee issues.
6/14/1993	Ford Cuts Prices of Big Cars	The Ford Motor Company is cutting the prices of its large Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis sedans by about $3,500 on certain well-equipped models. Ford cut the price of its Crown Victoria by 15.6 percent, to $17,945, for a model that includes air-conditioning, power windows and door locks, cruise control and a driver's air bag. Prices of the Grand Marquis were cut about 15 percent, to $19,990 for the GS model and $20,850 for the more luxurious LS model.
6/4/1993	Vehicle Sales Rose 15% in May	United States sales of cars and light trucks rose 15 percent in May, compared with May 1992, the leading auto makers reported today. The big gain, which included sales of domestic and imported vehicles, came as the Ford Motor Company said it had record truck sales for the month. In addition, the Chrysler Corporation reported its best overall May sales in five years.
6/4/1993	BUSINESS DIGEST	Companies Car and truck sales rose in late May, extending a string of increases and suggesting strengthening demand.

5/29/1993	FORD TO LIFT PRICES ON SELECTED CARS AND TRUCKS	The Ford Motor Company is increasing prices on selected United States cars and trucks by an average four-tenths of 1 percent, or $68, effective immediately. A Ford spokeswoman said the increases were made to partly recover product-related costs. She declined to be more specific. Ford's price increase, announced on Thursday, was widely expected by analysts, who expect the General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, to follow with one of its own soon. The third-ranked Chrysler Corporation raised prices on several popular models by as much as $200 late last month.
5/26/1993	Clinton Says U.S. Car Makers Are 'Winning the Quality Race'	Sales of domestically built cars and trucks rose 18.4 percent in mid-May as consumers put aside fears of economic weakness and responded to low interest rates on financing, the auto makers said today. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 7.4 million for the period of May 11-20, up from 6.4 million in early May and up from 6.7 million for the same period a year earlier.
5/26/1993	Low Interest Rates Help U.S. Vehicle Sales	Sales of domestically produced vehicles rose 30.2 percent in early May, the nation's auto makers said today, extending the strengthening automotive market into a fourth straight month. Demand for light trucks, which include mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, showed particular strength, with a 44.4 percent sales gain in the period from May 1 to May 10, to 126,324, compared with 87,497 in the comparable period a year ago.
5/14/1993	Sales of U.S.-Produced Vehicles Up	ONE of the bad things about driving a passel of cars is that they all run together in the mind. Ask anyone who travels a lot and rents a different car at each airport. They'll say they liked the last car, really liked it. They'll say it was a Pontiac Grand Am. Or, wait, maybe a Toyota? It may be a failure of concentration or just ennui. But what it amounts to is multihued confusion, even when you're paying attention, and I can guarantee my own occasional fuddle.
5/9/1993	Ford's SHO, an Ocelot in Bull's Clothing	The Associates Corporation of North America said yesterday that an affiliate had agreed to acquire substantially all the assets of Mack Trucks Inc.'s truck financing division. Associates, part of the Financial Services Group of the Ford Motor Company, did not disclose terms. The sale is expected to be completed within 90 days, the company said.
5/4/1993	FORD UNIT TO BUY ASSETS OF MACK TRUCKS FINANCE DIVISION	The chief executives of the Big Three auto makers asked top Administration officials today for help on a broad range of issues including international trade, regulations, technology and health insurance. John F. Smith Jr. of General Motors, Harold A. Poling of Ford Motor and Robert J. Eaton of Chrysler urged the joint development of a comprehensive plan to help the auto industry regain its global preeminence.
4/29/1993	Auto Makers Ask White House for Broad Range of Help	The Ford Motor Company reported improved first-quarter earnings today, far exceeding analysts' estimates, but still short of what the auto maker said it would deem acceptable. That was the sort of talk investors loved to hear, and Ford shares rose $1.875, to $54.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. More than three million shares traded hands.
4/29/1993	Ford First-Quarter Profit Is Better than Expected	DOUGLAS & LOMASON CO., Farmington Hills, Mich., has received a contract from the Ford Motor Co. to supply seats for the replacement to the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz models to be introduced in 1995. The contract is expected to generate $74 million in annual revenue. OFFSHORE PIPELINES INC., Houston, said its domestic and international operating companies and joint ventures had been awarded several offshore construction contracts valued at $76 million.
4/23/1993	COMPANY NEWS	In a deal that would increase American car exports to Japan, the General Motors Corporation has tentatively agreed to make up to 20,000 cars a year in the United States for sale by the Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan under the Toyota brand name. The arrangement, confirmed by G.M. today, would be a reversal of the usual pattern in which Japanese companies have made cars in Japan that are sold to American consumers as G.M., Ford and Chrysler cars.
4/15/1993	Sales Rise For Vehicles Built in U.S.	Sales of domestically built vehicles excluding those built by the Ford Motor Company rose 14.8 percent in early April from the corresponding period a year ago. In a deviation from its pattern of reporting on the same day as other auto makers, Ford said it would release its 10-day sales figures on Thursday. The Chrysler Corporation does not provide partial monthly figures; its sales are estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports. 'Demand Is Only So-So' Some analysts cautioned that demand could be slightly better or slightly worse once hard data from Ford and Chrysler were available.
4/14/1993	Clean-Air Laws Push Big 3 To Cooperate on Electric Car	In an extraordinary collaboration by Detroit's auto makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are discussing jointly building an electric car to meet the requirements of the clean-air law first enacted in California and recently adopted by several Northeastern states. Officials of the companies said yesterday that they were considering the project because of impending deadlines.
4/14/1993	Auto Makers In Joint Patent	The Big Three auto makers said today that their research consortium had been awarded its first patent. The patent covers technology that one day may permit auto makers to substitute parts made of lighter-weight plastic composite materials for parts made of steel, thus improving fuel economy. The United States Council for Automotive Research, which was started by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler last year, said the patent represented the first time the auto makers together had produced an original technology.
4/8/1993	DECEMBER INTRODUCTION SET FOR NEW MUSTANG MODEL	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would start selling an all-new version of its Mustang car on Dec. 27, with production to start at the auto maker's Dearborn, Mich., plant on Oct. 4. It will be the first completely new design for the Mustang since 1979. About 6.1 million Mustangs have been sold since the original model was introduced in 1964.
4/3/1993	FORD EXTENDS REBATES ON MOST OF ITS AUTOS	The Ford Motor Company yesterday extended retail buyer rebates on most new cars and trucks until May 3 and increased discounts on several newer models. Rebates range from $200 to $3,000, as under the previous offer that expired March 31. Discount financing with an annual rate of 6.9 percent on loans up to 48 months is offered in lieu of rebates on most models. That rate was previously 3.9 percent to 5.9 percent, depending on the model. Ford increased the rebates on its Aerostar vans to $1,000 from $750, and added a $400 rebate to its newly redesigned Ranger pickup trucks with automatic transmissions.
3/21/1993	America's Newest Industrial Belt	"WALK down the long rows of huge machines, newly installed in the freshly painted Ford Motor Company factory. Stop to examine the futuristic control panels that will run this automated factory. Watch Mexican engineers fine-tuning the new machines. And it becomes easy to imagine -- except for the Spanish and the low salaries -- that this most modern of engine plants is really in Dearborn, Mich., and not here on an arid plateau in northern Mexico. Staffing the plant are people like Eleazor Faudoa, a 32-year-old technician equal in skill and motivation to the best in Dearborn, but earning only $1,000 a month, one-fourth the wage of an American counterpart. Currently, Mr. Faudoa heads a team completing the installation of machines that will grind the connecting rods for a new four-cylinder, multi-valve engine. Illustrating the sort of initiative often sought from American workers, Mr. Faudoa had a say in the machinery's design. """"The manufacturers agreed to incorporate some of our suggestions,"""" he said, """"like those for a simpler electrical system and for easier access for maintenance."
3/17/1993	Ford in Shanghai	The Ford Motor Company has signed a letter of intent to set up an auto parts joint venture in Shanghai. Ford and its partner, the Shanghai Yanfeng Automobile Interior Trimming Factory, will invest about $90 million in the project, Wang Zhukang, director of the Shanghai Foreign Investment Commission, said.
3/14/1993	The Clinton Fuel Tax Finds a Few Unexpected Allies	ORDINARILY, big companies are not eager for their customers to pay higher taxes any more than the customers themselves like it. But President Clinton's proposed energy tax is demonstrating that, among big auto-makers, refiners and utilities, politics is thicker than oil. If enacted as proposed, the tax would raise gasoline prices by at least 8 cents a gallon, and a typical homeowner's electric bill by $1.50. However, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have decided they support the higher fuel tax, and, broadly speaking, so do the chairmen of Arco, the refining company, and Southern California Edison, the utility. Other companies the tax would hurt have hinted that they are not entirely against it.
3/9/1993	Ford Motor Unit Prices Notes	The Associates Corporation of North America, a Dallas-based unit of the Ford Motor Company, yesterday priced $300 million of seven-year notes through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. The notes, which are due in 2000, have a 6 percent coupon and are priced at 100 to yield about 54 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
3/4/1993	Mazda Ends Idea of a Ford Pact for Europe	The Mazda Motor Corporation said today that it had given up the idea of establishing joint European automobile production with the Ford Motor Company because the two companies could not agree on a plan. The decision, the latest setback among hard-pressed Japanese automobile makers, could make Mazda the only major Japanese manufacturer without a plant in Europe and could lead to restrictions on its sale of cars there, in light of increasingly stringent quotas on imported Japanese vehicles.
2/20/1993	Ford to Pay Shoemaker	BILL SHOEMAKER and his family will receive $1 million from Ford Motor Co. as the result of a 1991 accident that paralyzed the former jockey, according to settlement papers made available yesterday in Los Angeles. Shoemaker was driving a Ford Bronco II near San Dimas, Calif., when he veered off the highway and tumbled down an embankment. Shoemaker, who rode more winners than any other jockey in thoroughbred racing history, is a quadriplegic. He is now a trainer.
2/19/1993	Auto Makers in Paint Deal	The Big Three auto makers formed a consortium today to share technology and costs for developing low-emission paint systems aimed at reducing air pollution at more than 50 automotive assembly plants in the United States. The consortium will work to develop powder-based primer and clear-coat systems through the improvement of materials, equipment and operations, said John Young, chairman of the low-emission paint consortium who is an executive engineer at the Ford Motor Company.
2/12/1993	Ford and Citibank Issue Card	Moving to counter the General Motors Corporation's entry into the credit-card business, the Ford Motor Company and Citibank introduced a rival program yesterday. Under terms of the Ford Citibank Visa and Mastercard program, card holders would earn rebates on new Ford, Lincoln or Mercury vehicles equal to 5 percent of their total annual purchases, as much as $700 a year and accumulating for up to five years. That's a faster rebate program than offered by the G.M. card, which allows $500 in rebates a year for up to seven years.
2/11/1993	Ford Lost $7.4 Billion Last Year	The Ford Motor Company posted an $840.3 million fourth-quarter loss today and a $7.4 billion loss for the year, largely reflecting accounting changes and one-time charges against earnings. Without the special charges, however, Ford's yearly results were an improvement over 1991, when the nation's No. 2 auto maker also posted huge losses.
2/10/1993	Big Three Won't Seek Car Tariffs	Under pressure from foreign auto makers and facing some opposition from the Clinton Administration, the chief executives of Detroit's Big Three announced today that they had decided not to file complaints of unfair trade that would seek steep duties on imported cars. The decision is a boon for consumers, to the extent that they are spared higher prices, and for the Clinton Administration, which would have been forced by Federal law to decide the cases quickly. The Administration is being accused both by some in the United States and by many abroad of protectionist leanings.
2/8/1993	G.M. May Not Join in Move Against Japan	"The General Motors Corporation may not join its two big American rivals in filing broad """"dumping"""" complaints against Japanese car makers, G.M.'s chief executive says. John F. Smith Jr., the president and chief executive of G.M., said that he was not sure the cases could be won and that he was concerned about consumers' reaction to pleas for Government relief at a time when the Big Three are trying to convince the public they can compete with Japanese auto makers in areas like quality, value and customer service."
1/10/1993	The Cousins Who Would Be King	"In recent years Edsel B. Ford 2d has occasionally muttered in the presence of co-workers at the Ford Motor Company that """"my family owns the place and I'm not even a vice president."""" Those who hear this say his words sound less bitter than wry, or even half joking. No one is laughing, though. When Mr. Ford last expressed vexation with the progress of his career, and that of his cousin William Clay Ford Jr., the company narrowly avoided a nasty spat between the Ford family and Donald E. Petersen, the chief executive. Even so, Mr. Petersen retired early, tension with the Fords contributing to his exit. No one wants to risk a replay, because even though the Ford family doesn't own the whole place, it owns enough of it that it cannot be ignored."
1/7/1993	With Money No Object, Ford Beats Honda	The Ford Motor Company celebrated with a parade today as its Taurus model finished first -- by a stadium lot full of cars -- to win an industry rivalry for the nation's best-selling car. Only instead of the age-old fracas between Ford and Chevrolet, this time it was a showdown with the dreaded Japanese and the celebrated Honda Accord, which has been the American favorite for three years running.
1/5/1993	Playing a Game of Numbers; Race For No. 1 Nears End For Taurus and Accord	In the contest to outsell a rival model, the winner is often the auto maker that reports last. Fearing this, the Ford Motor Company suggested to the Honda Motor Company that the two auto makers exchange sales totals on Wednesday morning to make sure there are no last-minute additions. Honda's answer: No thanks.
12/17/1992	Ford to Cut $7.7 Billion From Net	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would account for its future costs for retiree benefits by taking a noncash after-tax charge of $7.5 billion in one huge swoop. The fourth-quarter charge means the auto maker is likely to have a 1992 net loss of between $6 billion and $7 billion, an American corporate record. Ford's accounting decision was included in a package of bookkeeping adjustments, including the one-time cost of eliminating 10,000 jobs next year from its European operations, which are struggling in the face of a worsening sales slump. Had Warned of a Loss In all, the nation's No. 2 auto maker said the special charges would reduce its 1992 income by $7.7 billion, which will be spread over the four quarters of 1992. Ford said results for the first three quarters would be restated to reflect the charges.
12/17/1992	Europe's Auto Industry Is at the Edge of a Crisis	The Ford Motor Company's decision today to slash production and eliminate nearly 10,000 jobs in Britain and Germany next year, came as several European car makers warned that they would suffer from rapidly falling sales as the European auto industry confronts the effects of a sharp economic downturn. Ford said it estimated that the overall European car market would shrink next year by 7 percent, to 11.9 million vehicles. Most European nations are suffering because of recession or lackluster economic growth, and consumer purchases of big-ticket items like cars have particularly suffered.
12/9/1992	Leasing Is Main Weapon In Battle for Top-Selling Car	WILL the Ford Taurus overtake the Honda Accord as America's best-selling car? With just a few weeks left in the year, Ford has its work cut out. Through the end of November, Ford was lagging by roughly 15,000 cars. But perhaps more interesting than the ultimate winner of these bragging rights is the marketing strategy of both auto makers of using low-cost leases to pump up sales. Although the lease deals are fairly close at first blush -- $199 a month for the Accord and $248 a month for the Taurus -- they are yielding different and noteworthy results in satisfying consumers.
12/5/1992	Ford's Chief Says Japanese Still Lag on Parts Purchases	"The chairman of the Ford Motor Company says Japanese auto makers are in danger of failing to meet commitments they made during President Bush's visit in January to increase their purchases of American automobile components. """"We're not moving as rapidly as desirable,"""" Harold A. Poling, the chief executive of the second-largest American car manufacturer, after General Motors, said in an interview on Thursday during a business trip here. """"I think it's in jeopardy,"""" he said of the goal."
12/2/1992	G.M. Retreats on Claims About Fatal Truck Fires	The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it may have provided Federal highway officials with potentially misleading statistics to bolster its claims about the safety of millions of pickup trucks now under investigation. Federal officials are deciding whether to recall about five million Chevrolet and G.M.C. full-sized pickup trucks made from 1973 to 1987 because a possible flaw in their fuel tanks makes them a fire hazard.
11/28/1992	FORD PLANS TO IDLE THREE PLANTS NEXT WEEK	"The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it planned to idle assembly lines at two truck plants next week """"to balance inventories,"""" which means sales were slow, and plans to idle a third plant for retooling. Ford said it would halt production of its F-250 and F-350 pickup trucks for two weeks, starting Monday, at its Norfolk, Va., plant, and would stop making full-size vans next week at its Lorain, Ohio, plant. The auto maker also plans to idle a third factory next week, its Dearborn, Mich., car plant where it makes Mustangs, for retooling to accommodate design and production changes."
11/26/1992	Honda Cut From U.S. Auto Group	"The United States auto makers' main trade organization today ejected its only Japanese member, the Honda Motor Company. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association explained that it was limiting membership to the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation """"to focus on the common issues and interests that are unique to the domestic manufacturers."""" The action signals that the Big Three plan to strengthen their lobbying efforts on trade and other issues."
11/13/1992	Ford Official Is Put in Line For Top Job	The Ford Motor Company promoted Alexander J. Trotman yesterday to president and chief operating officer of Ford's worldwide automotive group, putting him in line to succeed Harold A. (Red) Poling next year as chief executive. But Ford's directors passed on the chance to give Mr. Trotman the company's No. 2 job as corporate president and chief operating officer, which would have more strongly formalized his designation as heir-apparent.
11/8/1992	Viewpoints; The Big Three and Black America	As the General Motors Corporation strives to redefine itself and the Ford Motor Company struggles with a series of quarterly losses, the question must be asked: Does it really matter whether the Big Three supply most of the vehicles sold in the United States? Is it really a cause for concern if imports or the so-called new entrants -- American-based assembly and manufacturing plants owned by foreign auto companies -- sell the lion's share of vehicles here? No matter where you stand on this issue, there is one particularly critical, and often unacknowledged, asset of the traditional industry: the Big Three are a major source of jobs and income for minority Americans.
10/29/1992	Ford Registers a Loss for the Third Quarter	"The Ford Motor Company, hurt by weak automotive volume in North America and Britain, reported today that it lost $158.9 million in the third quarter, narrowing from a loss of $574.4 million in same 1991 period. Harold A. Poling, chairman and chief executive, singled out """"instability in European currency markets"""" that """"has led to lower sales in most of Ford's European markets, and will continue to affect the operating environment for the near term."
10/23/1992	FORD EXPECTS TO POST NARROWER 3D-PERIOD LOSS	The Ford Motor Company expects to report next week that its third-quarter loss narrowed to about $174 million, from $574 million in the year-earlier period. The auto maker included the estimate as it amended a Securities and Exchange Commission filing to lift its preferred-stock offering to $1 billion from $875 million to meet what it expects to be strong demand. Ford said in an Oct. 8 S.E.C. filing that weak market conditions in the United States and Europe could cause it to lose money in the fourth quarter as well. Analysts had expected Ford to earn 30 cents to 70 cents a share in the fourth period.
10/19/1992	Europe's Blitz on U.S. Earnings	As European currencies churned and heads of state squabbled a few weeks ago, the United States calmly stood back, an ocean away from the turmoil. For America's largest manufacturers, however, the United States now seems like an unsafe haven from European recessions and currency woes. Companies like Ford and I.B.M., which depend heavily on Europe, have begun reporting pinched profits and crimped sales.
10/11/1992	Moving Out the Cars With a 'No-Dicker Sticker'	Robert Fisher watched sales at his two Reading, Pa., dealerships slide for a couple of years. It was time to change or go out of business. He cut his sales force to three people from nine and on Labor Day began selling his Chevrolets and Oldsmobiles in a new way: no negotiating over the price. In the first month, sales rose to 207 vehicles from 115 the previous month. And while he made less money on each car -- an average of $700, down from $1,100, he said -- overall profits rose because he increased volume and cut his payroll by so much. For example, he said, his Bob Fisher Chevrolet dealership earned $13,000 in September, compared with a loss of $1,190 in August.
10/6/1992	G. M. Productivity Trails Domestic Rivals'	A study of the United States automobile industry's manufacturing productivity, due to be released this week, showed today that the General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, has fallen further behind its domestic rivals during the last two years. The Ford Motor Company continues to lead G.M. and the Chrysler Corporation in productivity, but since 1989 Chrysler has pulled away from G.M. and closer to Ford, according to James Harbour, president of Harbour & Associates of Troy, Mich., manufacturing consultants.
9/30/1992	COMPANY NEWS	FORD MOTOR CO., Dearborn, Mich., and Nissan Motor Company of Japan issued separate recalls to fix faulty brakes and seat belts on about 3,500 of their jointly built Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest mini-vans. GRUMMAN CORP., Bethpage, L.I., has been awarded a $7.9 million contract that could be worth $220 million from the Army to make intercom systems for combat vehicles. UNISYS CORP., Blue Bell, Pa., and California Republic Bank, Bakersfield, Calif., announced an agreement for a 10-year information systems outsourcing contract valued at $56 million.
9/27/1992	Happy Hoofbeats Out of the Past . . .	THERE are people like me in Detroit! Or at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, at least. If I was unsure before, I know it now that I have put in some time at the wheel of a new Mustang convertible, the one with the big 5-liter V8 and the huge tires and .... Ah. And the eye-popping red body with the pristine white roof and the white leather upholstery and the white wheels with the chrome horses in their hubs. This car is not only properly old-fashioned, it is dressed up like a tart on the town. And I love it.
9/13/1992	Stubborn Taurus Tramples on the Heels of the Accord	"They're calling it """"Showdown in Motown,"""" a title bout between the Honda Accord, champion for three consecutive years, and the Ford Taurus, the leading contender for best-selling car in America. When a slightly restyled Taurus was introduced a year ago, some reviewers criticized the Ford Motor Company for not undertaking a more far-reaching overhaul. But the model has sold far better than the critics expected, and the Taurus has continued to close in on the Accord, whose sales peaked at 417,000 in 1990, a year when Ford sold 313,000 Tauruses."
9/9/1992	At Ford, a Surprise in the Wings?	As the Ford Motor Company gets ready to name a new chief executive, a once-remote prospect, Alexander J. Trotman, has suddenly emerged as the favorite to succeed Harold A. (Red) Poling when the 67-year-old chairman retires next year. Executives familiar with Ford's prospective plans to realign top management say they think that Mr. Trotman, who is 59 and is currently executive vice president of North American operations, will receive a promotion putting him closer to that job at a board meeting on Thursday. But they said it was not clear what his new title would be.
8/22/1992	Patents; Applying Math To Tire Traction	The Ford Motor Company has invented a computer algorithm for an advanced traction-control system that prevents a car from spinning its wheels if a driver steps too hard on the gas. Traction-control systems, still in their infancy, are the opposite of computerized anti-lock brakes, which stop a car from sliding into an uncontrollable skid. A basic traction-control system, available on some luxury cars, monitors wheel rotation to determine when the wheels are spinning faster than the car is moving, and then slows the engine enough to let the tires regain their grip.
8/12/1992	The Talk of Detroit; Iacocca's Ford-Size Dreams Run Into 90's Reality	"Lee A. Iacocca has been many things in his storied automotive career. But one important goal has eluded him. For what he wants most is to be like Henry Ford 2d, who ruled the Ford Motor Company as if it were a fief whether he was in the executive suite or in retirement. When Mr. Ford was preparing to retire in the late 1970's, Mr. Iacocca wanted to succeed him. He knew the company, the industry and what needed to be done. """"In terms of everything that really counted,"""" Mr. Iacocca wrote in his autobiography, """"I was more important than Henry."
7/30/1992	Ford Posts $502 Million Net, But Stock Dips on Outlook	The Ford Motor Company today posted a $502 million second-quarter profit, compared with a loss last year of $324 million, and its revenue rose 12.5 percent. The results were Ford's best in two years, but company executives expressed caution, noting that the nation's economic recovery and those of key overseas markets remained fragile. And that caution was clear among investors, as Ford stock fell $1.50, to $44.25, in New York Stock Exchange trading, on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 45 points.
7/19/1992	From Ford, the Latest Pretty Face	"Steve Odell had to catch a plane at 4 o'clock, but just now we were on our way to lunch, and his question surprised me. """"You know what makes me unhappy about this car?"""" he asked. Well, no. The car was a 1993 Probe GT, out now for about a week, an all-new Ford hatchback whose gestation Odell has lived with for years. He has been Ford Motor Company's specialty car marketing manager, so unhappiness should not have been part of the fatherly equation."
7/16/1992	Ford Raising Retail Prices Average of 2.9% on '93 Cars	The Ford Motor Company said today that it was raising retail prices on most 1993-model cars an average of 2.9 percent, or $599, and on most 1993-model light-duty trucks by an average of 3 percent, or $563, over comparably equipped 1992 models. The increases are effective immediately.
6/25/1992	U.S. Trade Agency Turns Down Car Makers' Complaint on Japan	The Federal Government's trade agency ruled today that Detroit's auto makers had not suffered significant harm from imported Japanese mini-vans, a verdict that prevents the Commerce Department from proceeding with plans to impose tariffs on the imports. The decision by the independent agency, the International Trade Commission, to reject a highly political case is a landmark in American trade policy. It reflects the presence of a new majority, more skeptical of industry claims, on the little-known body, which has the power to block American industries from receiving Commerce Department protection from imports. A Former Member's Analysis Three new commissioners -- two Republicans and a Democrat -- have joined the six-member body in recent months, and the two Republicans appear to be taking a much narrower interpretation of the nation's trade law than their predecessors. Their terms will last as long as nine years.
6/23/1992	When It Pays to Complain: Detroit's 'Secret Warranties'	"When an auto maker decides to repair defects no longer covered by warranty -- without directly notifying owners -- does this demonstrate good will or a cynical policy of trying to save money by compensating only those who complain? The Ford Motor Company, like other auto makers, has faced this issue before. Now a consumer advocacy group is accusing Ford of maintaining a """"secret warranty"""" to cover what it says are a large number of defectively painted Ford full-size pickup trucks, the auto maker's best-selling model and one of the most popular vehicles of any kind sold in the United States."
6/20/1992	FORD LIFTING PRICES ON ITS KOREAN-BUILT FESTIVA	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it was increasing prices of its Korean-built Festiva subcompact car by an average 1.9 percent, or $156, for the 1993-model year. Prices will start at $7,097 for the L model, and $8,136 for the GL model. Ford said it was raising prices partly to recover increased production and distribution costs of the Festiva.
6/18/1992	Ford and Chrysler Outpace Japanese in Reducing Costs	Ford and Chrysler have increased the efficiency of their factories and workers so much in recent years that their basic cost of producing a car is now less than that of their Japanese rivals, according to a study published today. Auto analysts have long recognized the productivity improvements at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation. But the assumption within the industry has been that a production-cost gap remains between Detroit's second- and third-largest auto makers and the Japanese car companies, especially the Toyota Motor Corporation, generally regarded as the low-cost producer worldwide.
6/15/1992	Bronco II Accidents Pose New Questions For Ford on Safety	For much of the 80's, the Bronco II, a rugged little vehicle, was one of the Ford Motor Company's most popular products. Then statistics showed that a large number of people -- about 70 a year -- were killed in accidents in which Bronco II's rolled over. All along, Ford insisted that the Jeep-like vehicles were safe, and in 1990 Government regulators decided that a recall was not necessary. While the Bronco II is no longer made, 700,000 are still in use.
6/10/1992	MERCURY VILLAGER MINI-VAN STICKER: $16,504 OR $21,798	The Ford Motor Company said its Mercury Villager mini-van, to go on sale next month as a 1993 model, would be priced at $16,504 for the GS version and at $21,798 for the LS version. The front-drive Villager is the first mini-van to be sold by Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division, and the first front-drive van from Ford to compete with the Chrysler Corporation's popular Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. The Villager is the result of a $1 billion project started in 1988 with the Nissan Motor Company, which will have an almost identical version called the Quest. The vans, which have Nissan engineering and drive trains, went into production in April at Ford's plant in Avon Lake, Ohio.
6/9/1992	Accord on Auto Research	The Big Three auto makers said today that they had agreed to form a consortium to share technology for controlling auto emissions. The agreement by Chrysler, Ford and General Motors is the eighth such cooperative accord the auto makers have signed in the last few years. Their goal is to share noncompetitive technology in order to save costs and compete more effectively with foreign auto makers. A 1969 consent decree barring car makers from sharing research and development expired in 1987.
6/6/1992	A 2d Ford Plant Will Build Popular Sport-Utility Vehicle	The Ford Motor Company plans to convert its St. Louis plant to a second production site for its popular Explorer sport-utility vehicle by 1995, a company official said today. The executive, who declined to be identified, said the No. 2 auto maker would also end production by 1995 of its rear-drive Aerostar van, now made in St. Louis.
5/31/1992	Ford Caps Its Line of Crown Victorias	EXCEPT for New Orleans, where the cabs are as flamboyant as the food, you are not likely to see a spiffy taxi in most cities, much less in New York. So I was surprised when I got into one last week that had both a fresh wax job and a newly polished interior. Another surprise was that the car was a Ford, a rarity on potholed streets that are the special province of the Chevy Caprice. My comment on the oddities produced a conversation with the driver, who was genuinely pleased to hear that Ford has resumed its sale of rear-wheel-drive fleet vehicles after a 14-month hiatus.
5/27/1992	The Democrats, Standing Small	The European Community has taken what might be a historic step against protectionist farm policies. How are House Democratic leaders responding to this dramatic opportunity for trade? They're proposing a giant leap backward, sponsoring a bill that could victimize American workers in Japanese-owned auto factories, provoke Europe to retaliate against U.S. exports and undermine trade talks. Dan Rostenkowski, the usually sensible chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, as they anticipate the elections are eager to portray their party as standing tall, ready to bully trade partners into submission. That's an ignoble purpose. Protectionism would jack up car prices and shower Chrysler, Ford and General Motors with windfall profits. It won't create jobs or prosperity.
5/27/1992	Company News: Leasing Without Debt; Know How to Buy a Car? Ford Has Another Idea	Car buyers used to be easily divided into two groups: those who took out loans and those who paid cash to avoid debt. But new leasing programs are blurring this neat division and creating a numbing array of choices. The Ford Motor Credit Company added another wrinkle yesterday with an option that allows a customer to pay up front, in cash, all the monthly payments for a car lease.
4/30/1992	Ford Turns Profitable In Quarter	The Ford Motor Company, reversing a string of five money-losing quarters, today became the second Big Three auto maker to post a quarterly profit. Ford said it earned $338 million, or 60 cents a share, for the first quarter, compared with a loss of $884.4 million last year. The big swing to a profit reflected a 33 percent jump in sales of cars from Ford to its dealers in the United States as well as a more profitable mix of vehicles like the popular Ford Explorer utility vehicle and light- truck models.
4/21/1992	Ford's Jaguar Bet: Payoff Isn't Close	"To Ford Motor Company shareholders wondering when to expect a decent return from Ford's $2.5 billion acquisition of Jaguar, the British luxury car maker, Nicholas Scheele's words will not be comforting. When asked when that time might come, Mr. Scheele, Jaguar's new chairman, replied: """"My boss at Ford said it took us close to 40 years to get any benefit from the acquisition of Lincoln. I hope it doesn't take us 40 years to get any benefit out of Jaguar."
4/18/1992	Ardent Preacher of Radical Change	"Michael Hammer is preaching to yet another flock of managers about casting off their old hierarchies and redesigning departments to """"find imaginative new ways to accomplish work."""" This time, the former M.I.T. professor, technology expert and now one of nation's hottest industry consultants, is in Manhattan mesmerizing a group of Time Warner executives and senior managers. As he prowls the stage, he tells them they had better rethink how they do everything, from buying notebooks to responding to customers' complaints -- or else."
4/16/1992	Ford to Take 50% Share in Mazda Plant	The Ford Motor Company agreed in principle today to buy a 50 percent interest in the Mazda Motor Corporation assembly plant in Flat Rock, Mich. The move would draw the two auto makers closer in their worldwide affiliation. Mazda, which is 25 percent owned by Ford, started production at the plant in 1987, building its own MX-6 model and its twin, the Ford Probe. Mazda later added another model, the 626, but the factory has not operated near its capacity of 240,000 vehicles annually.
4/15/1992	Ford Unveils Cleanest-Running Cars for California	California state smog officials and the Ford Motor Company unveiled two new automobile models today that they said were the cleanest-running cars ever approved for mass production in the world. They were updated versions of the Ford Escort and the Mercury Tracer, engineered to meet pollutant emission standards California has set for 1997 models, four years ahead of schedule. The new cars are to go on sale at Ford dealers in California starting May 21, when the 1993 models are introduced.
4/14/1992	Ford Plans $3 Billion Outlay To Raise Production Levels	The Ford Motor Company announced a $3 billion investment in new machinery and plant space today, some of which will be used to build a new mini-van in late 1993. When auto sales were brisk in the 1980's, Ford was tightly constrained by too little production capacity, and today's announcement is a step to correct that problem. The No. 2 auto maker's actions will affect a number of plants in the United States and Canada and should result in 1,300 new jobs at Ford's truck plant in Louisville, Ky., a spokesman said. Before the recession, Ford's hourly employees typically worked a great deal of overtime to meet demand for vehicles.
4/10/1992	Ford Cut Pay Of Its Chief to $1.14 Million	The Ford Motor Company's chairman, Harold A. Poling, took a 6.6 percent pay cut in 1991, earning $1.14 million in salary and other compensation, the company disclosed yesterday. While the base salary for the top five officers of the No. 2 auto maker did not change in 1991 from 1990, cuts were made in non-salary compensation like allowances for overseas assignments and club memberships.
3/24/1992	Supreme Court Roundup; Justices Will Hear Appeal of Animal Sacrifice Ban	Accepting a case it could use to redefine the constitutional limits of government interference with religious practice, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide the validity of a Florida city's ban on animal sacrifice. The case is an appeal by followers of Santeria, an ancient African religion practiced by thousands of Caribbean immigrants to the United States, in which animal sacrifice plays a central ceremonial role.
3/13/1992	THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters; Hurt and Angry Car Workers Say Brown Speaks for Them	Day by day, week by week, the turn of events eats away at the working men and women of this blue-collar city. They're losing their livelihood, the giant General Motors plant here. They've already lost half their jobs at the two neighboring Ford plants. Now they've even lost their Presidential candidate, with the withdrawal this week of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
3/13/1992	Ford to Expand Offer Of One Price for Escorts	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it was expanding nationwide a marketing program for its Escort LX that has won over many reluctant shoppers: one price, no haggling. The pricing strategy has increased sales during a five-month test among dealers in the Northeast, Southeast and West. Dealers say consumers appreciate the simplicity of the one-price program, in which the 1992 LX models -- including four-door sedans, two hatchback models and station wagons -- are sold for $9,999. The models are equipped with many options, including air-conditioning, but an automatic transmission costs $732 extra.
3/10/1992	Argentina Deal Seen for Ford	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it was negotiating to sell 65,000 Ford Tempos to an association of taxi drivers in Argentina. If completed, the deal would be among Ford's largest export orders ever. Ford bid $550 million for the deal, according to Phoenix Plus, a Toronto-based vehicle sales and leasing company that is acting as the intermediary.
2/27/1992	Detroit Leaning on Japan, in Both Senses	"When Lee A. Iacocca, the outspoken chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, demands that America take a stand against Japanese car imports surely he must not be talking about car No. 11AMRXML2D19W-C06, which rolled off the line here the other day. The car was produced by teams of Japanese workers all wearing neat uniforms with """"Mitsubishi Motors"""" emblazoned on the back. But the sporty. bright red model is a Dodge Stealth, made by Mitsubishi, and sold in America starting at about $17,000. And the only thing that makes it seem American is the word """"Dodge"""" etched in the front bumper. Mr. Iacocca made no mention of Mitsubishi's Nagoya plant when he visited Japan with President Bush in January, and these days people at the plant say as little as possible about Mr. Iacocca. Confused Feelings """"We feel a little funny about him,"""" Kozo Naruse, the deputy general manager, conceded the other day, shaking his head. """"Here he is talking about keeping Japanese cars out of America, and every day we come to work and make very good Chryslers."
2/23/1992	It's Flash, It's Dash and It's Out of Detroit	"Detroit is once again turning heads with its car designs the striking forms of the Cadillac Seville, Buick Skylark and Chrysler's new family of mid-size sedans. The change has energized the Big Three's studios, where designers still wince at the memory of a 1983 Fortune magazine cover showing four General Motors models, one indistinguishable from the next. That image sent home the point -- """"signed, sealed and delivered,"""" as one designer put it: car styling, a traditional American strength, had become a weakness. In recent years, even while battling the incursions of foreign car makers and retooling to meet ever-stricter Federal standards, they have kept a wistful eye on design. And in recent months, they have rolled out the fruits of their new visions, designed to distance themselves from the drab decades, to return to the days when the whole car -- not just the vanity plate -- made the statement of who you are. It's hardly a return to the be chromed land yachts of the 1950's, but it is a world of """"cab forward"""" design, cat-eye headlights and even plastic cladding around the bottom, an upscale image borrowed from Europe that lends a racy line (as well as protecting the paint job from road debris)."
2/22/1992	Ford Discloses Engine Outlay	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would invest $1.2 billion to develop and build a new line of V-6 engines at its Cleveland Engine Plant No. 2 by the mid-1990's. Plans by the nation's No. 2 auto maker to build the new line of V-6 engines in Cleveland were first announced in February 1990. Today's announcement confirms the size of the investment, which includes $700 million to refurbish the Cleveland plant.
2/14/1992	Ford Loses $475.7 Million In Quarter	"The Ford Motor Company, capping a year with its largest deficit ever, posted a fourth-quarter loss of $475.7 million today on revenues of $21.98 billion. The latest results actually improved on last year's fourth quarter, when Ford lost $518.5 million on revenues of $24.19 billion. The narrower loss from a reduced sales volume """"indicates that our efforts to reduce costs without compromising our product plans are working,"""" said Harold A. Poling, the chairman and chief executive. """"Not Out of the Woods"
2/14/1992	Vehicle Sales Post Sharp Rise	"Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose a robust 23.8 percent in early February, auto makers reported today. Although analysts had expected a gain over the sluggish period a year earlier, they said sales for the first 10 days of the month were the strongest sign of improvement in the auto industry since last summer. """"We're off the bottom, and there seems to be genuine improvement in retail demand,"""" said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst with Furman Selz in New York."
2/12/1992	Japanese May Raise Auto Prices	"Some Japanese auto makers said today that they were considering raising their prices in the United States. Such a move could prove costly to consumers, but analysts said it could provide an opportunity for the Big Three to win back market share and perhaps relieve some trade tensions. Executives of the American sales arm of the Toyota Motor Corporation said they were considering a price increase """"due to the continued appreciation of the Japanese yen, which has risen 9 percent since last summer."""" A stronger yen erodes the value of profits made in dollars. Toyota has already raised the base price of its redesigned 1992 Camry sedan by almost 18 percent from the 1991 level, to $14,368."
2/11/1992	Detroit Slows Minority Plan	The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company have slowed their minority dealer training programs until they can find dealerships for already qualified candidates, the auto makers said today. Ford has about 200 black dealerships, down from 277 in 1989, a company spokesman, Thomas Rhoades, said.
1/28/1992	U.S.-Japan Auto Parts Rift Grows	"In tones reflecting the increasingly combative exchanges between Japan and the United States, the head of a Japanese auto group said today that it was """"incomprehensible"""" that Detroit had not accepted Tokyo's offer to buy $19 billion more in American-made auto parts. He said top Japanese executives """"have no intention"""" of discussing the issue again with the Big Three. The comments by Yutaka Kume, the president of Nissan Motor Company and the chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, virtually erased any hopes of continuing discussions among the world's biggest auto makers about how to close the trade gap between the countries."
1/24/1992	Sales of American Vehicles Dropped 1.9% in Mid-January	"Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America declined 1.9 percent in mid-January, auto makers reported today. Industry analysts said the figures suggest that the market is neither improving nor worsening. """"It's a continuation of the malaise,"""" said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in Manhattan. """"We're probably going to bump along the bottom of this trough another six to eight weeks."""" Consumers 'Overly Cautious'"
1/24/1992	The New Buy-American Auto Sweepstakes	Maybe it was President Bush's mixed success in Japan, or the Japanese official who said that American auto workers were lazy and illiterate. Maybe it is the deep slump in Detroit. But all of a sudden, companies around the United States are saying it would be good for America to be good to G.M., and they are offering inducements to their employees to buy from General Motors, Chrysler or Ford. Some, groping to define just what constitutes an American car, are authorizing employees to buy autos made at the Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio, or Nissan's factory in Smyrna, Tenn. But other companies have ruled out cars carrying American nameplates if they are manufactured in Canada or Japan.
1/22/1992	Assembly Plant For Ford Exports	The Ford Motor Company said it planned to export to Europe 6,000 Explorer utility vehicles assembled at its plant here, beginning next year. The No. 2 United States auto maker -- which said it had total export orders for a record 51,500 vehicles in 1991 -- said Explorers intended for sale in Europe would be modified to meet European Community standards at a plant in which it was investing more than $500,000.
1/10/1992	A Trade Mission Ends in Tension As the 'Big Eight' of Autos Meet	"President Bush's hopes of returning home with what he called an """"action plan"""" to help Detroit began to unwind late this afternoon, in one of the most unlikely business meetings in the history of Japanese-American industrial rivalries. The chief executives of the world's eight largest auto makers -- three American, five Japanese -- gathered face to face in a hotel room in downtown Tokyo, with everyone in the room clearly understanding, and no one saying, that the American industry will probably never gain back the ground it has lost to Japanese imports and to Japanese cars made in American plants. A Tense Hour It was apparently the first time executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met directly with their counterparts at Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, which together now control more than a third of the American auto market. After a tense hour, during which the Japanese told their guests that American industry needed to transform itself radically, and the Americans warned that the time was long past when """"mere declarations of intent"""" to open markets would suffice, Lee A. Iacocca, the fiery head of the ailing Chrysler Corporation, finally spoke up."
1/9/1992	Chill Persists Between U.S. Car Makers and Japan	As trade negotiators argued all day and then froze for a moment after President Bush's collapse, the heads of America's three largest auto makers came face to face for the first time Wednesday with the commitment from Japan for the giant $8.4 billion superconducting supercollider in Texas, raising neand the Japanese agree on virtually nothing -- certainly not on how the American auto industry was driven to the brink, or on whose responsibility it is to fix it. As the auto executives simmered, however, negotiators for the United States and Japanese Governments appeared close to an agreement on Japanese purchases of American-made autos and auto parts. While the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced at midday today that a basic agreement had been reached, American officials were not yet confirming that. There was still considerable contention over the wording of the final agreement, and many key details have not yet been disclosed. Unimpressed Executives The auto executives who accompanied Mr. Bush have been unimpressed by a blitz of concessions and new import-purchase plans announced in recent days and they spent much of Wednesday warning the Japanese that failing to lower the trade deficit quickly would bring a hail of protectionist legislation from Congress.
1/8/1992	Right-Hand Ford Model Set for Japan	The Ford Motor Company, in a move intended to increase the appeal of its vehicles to the Japanese, said today that it would begin building right-hand-drive Ford Probe sporty coupes for export to Japan and Britain. This will be Ford's first model adapted specifically for sale in Japan. It will take the company 20 months to re-engineer the car, which will be produced at the Mazda Motor Corporation's Flat Rock, Mich. plant, said Alex J. Trotman, executive vice president in charge of North American operations. Ford owns 25 percent of Mazda.
1/7/1992	Don't Brake for Detroit	"When President Bush arrives in Japan today with an entourage of frustrated American businessmen, he will demand that Japan buy more American autos -- and pressure the Japanese Government to further restrict Japanese auto sales in the U.S. For the Americans, the $30 billion U.S.-Japan auto trade deficit is a result of Japanese unfairness rather than superior competitiveness. In June, Robert Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce, asserted that """"in virtually all cases [U.S. auto parts] have been shown to be just as good as"""" Japanese auto parts."
12/17/1991	Debut for Mercury-Nissan Mini-Van	"The Ford Motor Company will introduce the Mercury Villager mini-van on Tuesday in the hope of giving Mercury dealers a much needed way to attract families to their showrooms. And the model, built by Ford but designed by the Nissan Motor Company, further raises the competitive stakes for the Chrysler Corporation, whose dominance of the mini-van market may be further eroded. Frank J. Buban, sales manager of Bob Dusseau Lincoln-Mercury in Farmington, Mich., said the Mercury Sable station wagon had attracted some families, """"but if they have three or more children, they tend to want a mini-van."
12/14/1991	Patents; An Inventor Wins, but Isn't Happy	Having just won his second big patent battle against the automobile industry, Robert W. Kearns is well on the way to becoming a very rich man. One would think the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper might finally be at peace. Mr. Kearns's device, which sweeps the windshield of light rain or mist every few seconds, has become a common auto fixture, and his long struggle against the industry has resulted in victory against Ford and this week against Chrysler. But Mr. Kearns still feels the patents system has failed. It is not just that he feels the payments he has received are far less than he had argued were fair compensation. The bigger issue, he said, is lost time.
11/30/1991	Chairman Is to Retire From Ford of Britain	Derek Barron, 62 years old, who has been the chairman of Ford of Britain for five years, is to retire on Dec. 31. Mr. Barron, who has been with the company for 40 years, was appointed chairman in 1986. He will be succeeded by Ian G. McAllister, who became managing director of Ford of Britain in September 1991, following a period as general marketing manager of the Lincoln Mercury division in the United States.
11/23/1991	Ford Shutdowns	The Ford Motor Company said it would close its car plant in Oakville, Ontario, for two weeks starting on Monday and would extend the closing of its Atlanta car plant another week because of slow sales. The Oakville plant makes about 4,800 Tempo and Topaz models a week. Ford's Atlanta plant produces about 5,000 Taurus and Sable cars a week. Ford's Escort car plant in Wayne, Mich., and the Thunderbird/Cougar plant in Lorain, Ohio, will be closed for a second week, also starting on Monday, as previously announced. This week, 8 of Ford's 16 car and truck assembly plants are closed because of a lack of dealer orders.
11/10/1991	All About/Pickup Trucks; Will Detroit Lose Control of the Reliable Pickup?	Automobiles go through a metamorphosis every new model year. But pickup trucks are a constant. Though options have been added, the basic models have changed very little through the years. Such steadfastness has been good for Detroit. Pickup trucks, which account for about 18 percent of all vehicles sold, are one of the last segments of the market in which the Big Three still hold a substantial edge. Intensely loyal buyers make Ford and Chevrolet's full-size pickups their best-selling vehicles year after year, outselling even their most popular cars. Detroit dominates the compact and intermediate pickup categories as well.
11/9/1991	S.& P. Cuts Ratings on G.M. and Revises Outlook on Ford	"Large and continuing losses at the nation's two largest auto makers prompted the Standard & Poor's Corporation today to lower the ratings on the preference and preferred shares of General Motors and revise its ratings outlook to """"negative"""" from """"stable"""" for the bonds and preference shares of Ford. S.& P. said it had lowered the G.M. ratings by one notch. It also warned that it might reduce the ratings on $90 billion of the company's debt, the ratings of which were last lowered in February. The rating on $110 billion worth of Ford debt was affirmed."
11/3/1991	Automatic? Then Why a Tach?	Dear Sir: This letter is prompted by your article on the '92 Ford, which had special interest for me because I have a '91 Ford Taurus. You mention that the instrument panel has a 7,000-r.p.m. tachometer. What is its purpose, especially in a car with an automatic transmission?
10/31/1991	Ford Engines Returning to Indy	The battle between auto industry giants, Ford and Chevrolet, is once again off to the races with the imminent return of Ford engines to the Indy-car circuit after an absence of 20 years. Cosworth Engineering and Ford Motor Company announced yesterday the formation of a new Indy-car team to provide engines for the 1992 season.
10/27/1991	Fuming Over Ashtray Remark	"To the Sports Editor: Your car reviewer, Marshall Schuon, spends most of his time ogling the dashboard of the Ford Taurus (""""Ford Rounds Off a Few More Edges,"""" The Times, Oct. 20). He writes, """"it ought to be said that the ashtray is excellent."
10/25/1991	Ford and Mazda Warn Consumers About Defect	The Ford Motor Company and Mazda Motor of America today warned consumers of a potential transmission defect on several pickup, minivan and utility vehicle models built at Ford's plant in Louisville, Ky. The defect could allow a vehicle to roll even if the shift lever is in the park position. Ford said it had not figured out the exact nature of the defect and was advising affected drivers to use the parking brake when their trucks were not in use. Ford officials said they hoped to announce a recall before the end of the year, when the company would repair or replace defective parts.
10/23/1991	Big Losses For Top 2 In Detroit	The General Motors Corporation posted a $1.1 billion third-quarter loss today and the Ford Motor Company recorded a $574 million loss as the recession-ravaged United States auto industry skidded toward its worst year in history. The Chrysler Corporation is not scheduled to announce third-quarter results until next week, but auto analysts say it, too, will post a sizable loss, which would push total industry losses for the first nine months of the year to about $5 billion. In 1980, its worst year ever, the American auto industry lost $4 billion.
10/20/1991	Ford Rounds Off A Few More Edges	I WORK nights and I don't do mornings. But sometimes, against better judgment, I find myself at breakfast. And it was one of those times, talking to some Ford guys, that I had my eyes opened wide. I hate that. What did it was the statement that the company had spent $3 billion to develop its new Taurus. This was back in 1985, mind you, and I scribbled it down through eyes that were as red as my bloody mary. Three billion dollars? That is three thousand million. I mean, for what?
10/16/1991	Iacocca Urges U.S. Limits on Japanese Car Sales	"Lee A. Iacocca said today that the Big Three auto makers should consider promoting Federal legislation to limit the Japanese car industry to a fixed percentage of the American market. Speaking at the dedication of the Chrysler Corporation's $1 billion technology center outside Detroit, Mr. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said: """"We've never favored a complete restriction, but we'll have to decide our collective position. We have to deal with our own self-interests. At some point, you have to decide what you stand for."
9/26/1991	India Approves Ventures With Americans	India's Commerce Minister announced today that his Government had approved two joint ventures between American multinationals and local companies, and preliminary plans for two others. The minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, said India had given final approval for a joint venture by I.B.M. and the Indian conglomerate Tata Industries to produce I.B.M. Personal System 2 computers and computer programs, and by the Indian auto maker Maruti Ltd. and the Ford Motor Company to produce aluminum radiators for cars.
9/20/1991	Ford Light Trucks Will Get Air Bags	"The Ford Motor Company will install driver-side air bags on all its light-duty trucks by 1994, its chairman, Harold A. Poling, said at a news conference. Ford will put more than a million """"air-bag-equipped light trucks on the road by the end of 1995,"""" Mr. Poling said. It will begin installing passenger-side air bags in all light trucks in the middle of the decade, he said."
9/5/1991	Ford Tinkers With Design of Taurus	So few models introduced by the American automobile industry in the 1980's qualify as success stories that it is little wonder the Ford Motor Company has been slow and cautious in revamping its formidable Taurus family sedan. Sure enough, the new 1992 Ford Taurus and the twin Mercury Sable shown to journalists here today have only a few cosmetic exterior changes, like narrower headlights and a more sloping hood. The cars carry engines and transmissions nearly identical to those in the models they replaced. The biggest changes are redesigned interiors that are sleeker and more modern-looking.
8/31/1991	Ford Incentives	The Ford Motor Company is offering rebates of $500 to $750 and loans with 7.9 percent interest rates for purchases of certain 1992-model cars and light trucks. The incentives are in effect for orders placed through Sept. 25, the day before most of the models are to be officially introduced, Ford said. Cars covered in the incentive program include the Escort, Tracer, Tempo, Topaz, Taurus, Sable, Thunderbird, Cougar, Mustang, Probe, Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis. Trucks and vans include the Ranger, Aerostar F-series and Bronco. Not
8/15/1991	Ford Registers To Offer Notes	The Ford Motor Company has filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for up to $2 billion in notes. The proceeds will be used to retire some debt and purchase receivables.
8/6/1991	Chase to Sell Most of Its Leasing Operation	The Chase Manhattan Corporation announced plans yesterday to sell most of its leasing businesses in the United States and Canada to four finance companies, including subsidiaries of the General Electric Company and the Ford Motor Company. The sales will reduce Chase Manhattan's asset size by about $2.2 billion and help strengthen the company's financial condition.
8/1/1991	Sony Buys Site	The Sony Corporation of America said it had acquired a 38-acre parcel of land from the Ford Motor Company in San Jose, Calif., for about $22.8 million. The site will be developed into an office for Sony's computer, professional broadcasting equipment and other non-consumer businesses. The company plans to complete a 500,000-square-foot building by 1993.
7/26/1991	G.M., Ford Again Post Big Losses	The nation's two largest car companies reported big losses yesterday, G.M. for the fourth consecutive quarter and Ford for the third, reflecting lower production and weak demand for cars and trucks in most markets -- particularly the United States. The General Motors Corporation said it lost $785 million in the second quarter. The No. 2 auto maker, the Ford Motor Company, posted a quarterly loss of $324 million.
7/24/1991	Prices Are Up 3.7% On '92 Ford Cars	The Ford Motor Co. said it would raise its pre-introduction prices an average 3.7 percent on its 1992-model cars, and its truck prices by 3.9 percent. Pre-introduction prices, a summertime rite in Detroit, are used for large fleet purchases, like those by car-rental companies. Dealers may take orders on vehicles at pre-introduction prices, which gives an auto maker an idea of initial production runs for the vehicles.
7/16/1991	Ford-Volkswagen Portugal Venture	The Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen A.G. of Germany signed contracts with the Portuguese Government for a $2.8 billion project to make a new multipurpose van in Portugal starting in 1994. The deal, which represents the largest single foreign investment in Portugal, calls for the auto makers to each own half of the project. They said the factory would be the most modern in Europe and would produce 180,000 vehicles a year, more than 90 percent for export. The project should create 5,000 jobs directly and 7,000 indirectly. Work on a 240,000-square-yard factory will start immediately.
7/16/1991	Bankruptcy Tarnishes Ford's Shining Image	The horse farm cited as an example of excellence in a widely seen television image-advertising campaign for the Ford Motor Company has become a business failure. Calumet Farm, which produced champion horses like Whirlaway and Citation, last week filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws. Calumet, based in Lexington, Ky., was the subject of one of two spots in the campaign, which was broadcast from February until recently.
7/16/1991	Ford Executive Named A Dean at Boston U.	Louis E. Lataif, once a fast-rising young star at the Ford Motor Company, will be leaving Ford in September to become the dean of Boston University's School of Management, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1961. Mr. Lataif, who is 52 years old, succeeds George McGurn, who stepped down earlier this year after five years in the post.
7/12/1991	Ford Studied Chrysler	Executives of the Ford Motor Company contemplated buying the Chrysler Corporation last winter but decided against a bid because their company had enough financial problems of its own, The Wall Street Journal said today. The newspaper quoted unidentified people familiar with the situation as saying that Chrysler's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, asked Ford's former chairman, Donald E. Petersen to act as an intermediary in talks between the auto makers. Mr. Iacocca, a former Ford executive, approached Mr. Petersen after Chrysler's talks with the Italian auto maker Fiat S.p.A. fell through, The Journal reported. But the newspaper said it was not clear whether Ford and Chrysler officials held any direct meetings. Officials at Ford and Chrysler, along with Mr. Petersen, declined to comment on the matter.
7/11/1991	Van-Dumping Study Voted	The International Trade Commission voted today to continue investigating complaints by the Big Three American auto makers that Japanese competitors were illegally dumping mini-vans on the United States market. The three-member commission unanimously found reasonable grounds to believe that the American industry had been damaged by the Japanese trade practices.
7/4/1991	Vehicle Sales Dip, but Selling Rate Picks Up	Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 10.1 percent in late June compared with an unusually strong period a year earlier. On a seasonally adjusted basis, however, the results provided new evidence that the sluggish American automotive market is gaining strength. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 7.4 million for the June 21-30 period, the highest rate since late December. The late June rate compared with an 8.1 million rate a year earlier and a 6.5 million rate in mid-June.
6/18/1991	Ford Offering Credit Cards In Effort to Lure Car Buyers	In the latest skirmish in the credit card wars, the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that one of its financial services units would offer a credit card as a marketing tool to help retain old Ford customers and attract new ones. But the Chrysler Corporation may also be planning to enter the credit card business, according to The American Banker, a trade publication. Unlike the Ford program, Chrysler's effort would be for private-label cards that would not carry the Chrysler logo but rather the name of a furniture store or similar issuer, the publication said.
6/12/1991	Ford Pulls Commercials From Audubon Show	"The Ford Motor Company has pulled its television commercials from """"New Range Wars,"""" an episode of the National Audubon Society's series of specials on TBS. The society said Ford had responded to pressure from ranchers and others who were angry about the program's exploration of the conflict between ranchers and animals on the range."
5/30/1991	U.S. Auto Makers' Research Venture	The Big Three auto makers formed a research consortium to study automotive electronics. The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation said the High Speed Serial Data Research and Development Partnership would conduct research and develop devices that electronically process data from components like brakes and direction sensors. The venture must be approved by the Justice Department, but little opposition is likely.
5/16/1991	Nissan Offers a Look at Its New Mini-Van	The Nissan Motor Corporation today showed a final prototype of the new luxury mini-van that will be manufactured by Ford, and said it would be called the Quest. The new van is the latest step by a Japanese auto maker to design, engineer and build vehicles in the United States. Seven Japanese auto companies have assembly plants in the United States, and several are adding to their American design and engineering abilities.
5/16/1991	Where Car Makers Fear to Cut	"Auto executives traditionally do not discuss future car and truck models for fear buyers might put off a purchase until the new ones arrive. But the Chrysler Corporation took that risk by recently allowing dealers, journalists and others onto its test track to give them a glimpse of the 1993 mid-size models on which Chrysler is pinning its hopes for a recovery. The slump in car sales and the national recession, which coincide with yet another big push by the Japanese for American market share, is squeezing Detroit and causing a torrent of cash to flow out the door. All of the auto makers are cutting costs and conserving resources. What they are struggling to avoid, though, are any deep cuts that would delay or eliminate new products. A Matter of Perceptions Chrysler, like the others in the Big Three, does not want investors, suppliers or lenders to get the idea that it is paring spending for new models, a perception that would only worsen its problems on the showroom floor. The pressure to spend, even when money is scarce, is a matter of market share for the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and a matter of survival for Chrysler. All three are striving to avoid having their need to save money force them into canceling or delaying important vehicle projects. G.M. on Monday announced plans to float an issue of preference stock to raise $600 million, partly to pay for future vehicle models, among them eight new-car and thee new-truck models in the next year. """"Spending for new products must go on in good times and bad,"""" said James B. Fitzpatrick, a G.M. vice president for communications and marketing. """"It is our lifeblood."""" Cash generated internally at G.M. has shrunk from $10.08 billion in 1987 to an estimated $5.27 billion this year, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Japanese auto makers can develop a new vehicle in far less time than Detroit can, and they are invading market niches in the United States where they have never been before. Today, for example, Nissan showed journalists its first mini-van, named the Quest. It was designed in California and will be built at a Ford plant near Cleveland starting next April. Last year, Nissan withdrew from the market its Axxess station wagon that was meant to attract mini-van buyers but was a flop. American auto makers know they cannot compete unless they compress their normal five-year product-gestation period to three years, like the Japanese, and bring out more new cars more frequently. Indeed, the most scathing criticism that could be leveled at the American auto industry would be to say that it was mortgaging the future by scrimping on new-product development. But new products take money. Depending on the extent of the redesign, the cost of bringing a new car to dealer lots ranges from $500 million to $1 billion. While G.M. has been able to keep most models on schedule, it has acknowledged a few delays. Rumors among parts suppliers say G.M. has delayed its redesigned S-10 Blazer utility vehicle to 1995, from 1994. Taking on More Debt As for Ford, it borrowed $800 million in the first quarter of the year, raising its debt to $8.2 billion; a year ago, debt stood at $4.4 billion. Ford's debt-to-equity ratio on March 31 was 38 percent, compared with 16 percent a year ago. Ford is trying to keep most future models on schedule, but analysts and suppliers say it has delayed the redesign of the Taurus and the Sable models for one year, to 1995. After Ford announced a first-quarter loss of $884 million, David N. McCammon, vice president-finance, said projects """"are basically intact, but we always are making timing adjustments"""" to cut costs and looking for ways """"to get a dollar's worth of new products for every 80 cents we spend."""" Chrysler, which has suffered critical losses and has little financial cushion, has the least borrowing power among the Big Three, the lowest relative stock price, and the least ability to put money into new products. But Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., said Chrysler more than any other American auto maker might be trying to pull spending forward. Perhaps because of its well-publicized financial weakness, the No. 3 auto maker must go to the greatest lengths to prove that its $3 billion in cost-cutting is not hampering development of new models. The company renegotiated a $1.5 billion line of credit after the lowering of its debt ratings made borrowing from the public too expensive. """"The fear is that Chrysler is cutting into muscle and bone,"""" said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. """"But I hope not, because I love the way the L/H looks."""" He was referring to the code name for Chrysler's 1993 mid-size sedan, which will be sold by the Eagle, Dodge and Chrysler divisions; it will be built, starting next year, at a factory in Bramalea, Ontario. Other Chrysler vehicles badly need replacement, too. The full-size pickup truck -- referred to by some Chrysler engineers as """"Festus,"""" the grizzled codger in the """"Gunsmoke"""" television western -- has not been redesigned for more than 15 years. Chrysler is planning to replace it in 1993. No Profits, No Cash In economically healthy times auto makers pay part of their new-product costs with cash from current sales. But with no profits, auto makers must increase borrowings or sell equity. In the last six months, the Big Three have been forced to trim dividends and drastically cut costs to strengthen balance sheets enough to finance new-product spending. One-time expenses have also been a drain on cash. G.M., for example, was obligated on March 1 to buy $600 million worth of its class H stock from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as part of the renegotiated terms of the sale of Hughes Aircraft to G.M. in 1985. The three-year labor contract negotiated in the fall with the United Automobile Workers union has become a huge financial burden as well. Under its terms, the Big Three must pay most workers even if they are laid off, a situation that makes labor costs akin to a fixed expense. In previous recessions, labor expenses went down as sales and production dropped, allowing auto makers to keep losses in check. In 1982, under an earlier labor agreement, the industry was operating at only 62 percent of capacity, yet auto makers were breaking even. But last year, utilization was at 78 percent and still the industry lost about $5 billion in North America, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. The Cost of Competition Of course, foreign imports and transplants -- Japanese cars made in America -- were not as much of a factor during the last recession. Vicious competition is hurting the Big Three's ability to maintain prices. Even with much lower production, the auto makers have been forced to continue offering large rebates on most car and truck models -- another drain on cash. Shorter development cycles for cars like Chrysler's L/H model should help to cut costs, analysts say. Chrysler will have brought the L/H out in 42 months, a 30 percent reduction in the typical development time, helping produce a 25 percent cut in development costs, according to an estimate by Sanford C. Bernstein. Chrysler believes the length of the cycle will be about 39 months, said Glen Gardner, who heads the project; that compares with the Japanese average of about 36 months. """"The trick is going to be to get the rest of our projects on this schedule,"""" he said."
5/14/1991	Ford Recalls Million Vehicles With a Variety of Problems	The Ford Motor Company said today that it was recalling more than one million cars and trucks for safety and pollution problems. The company said about 270,000 1988-89 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars were being recalled because of wiring wear that could cause a fire in the passenger compartment.
5/12/1991	Technology;And Now, the Modular Auto Engine	Since Henry Ford started mass-producing internal-combustion engines in 1913, the United States automotive industry has been constrained by a seemingly immutable rule: Each engine line can produce only one type of engine. But at a refurbished tractor factory in Romeo, Mich., the Ford Motor Company has embarked on an ambitious project that would allow it to make different versions of the same engine on a single line.
5/11/1991	Ford Shifts Top Posts in Sales and Marketing	The Ford Motor Company announced a shuffling of some top sales and marketing executives yesterday as part of its effort to improve domestic car sales. Robert L. Rewey, vice president of Ford's North American Sales Operations, announced that Thomas J. Wagner, former head of the Ford division, would become vice president and general manager for the Ford Parts and Service division.
5/4/1991	Ford Aids Workers	The Ford Motor Company borrowed $150 million from a $473 million reserve left over from the 1987-90 labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union to help pay benefits for laid-off workers. The transfer was announced earlier this week to local union officials by Ernest Lofton, U.A.W. vice president and head of the union's Ford Department, and confirmed by Ford.The auto maker and the union signed a contract last fall requiring Ford to pay up to $1.6 billion in supplemental unemployment benefits. The money will be paid out as needed.
5/3/1991	Fiat Takeover of Ford Unit	The European Commission today approved the takeover of the Ford Motor Company's European farm machinery subsidiary by Fiat S.p.A. after the Italian company made a key concession. It approved the deal for Ford New Holland after Fiat agreed to end its exclusive supply deals in Italy, enabling competitors to enter that country.
5/1/1991	Big Losses For Ford And G.M.	The nation's two biggest auto makers announced huge first-quarter losses today. The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest car maker, reported a net loss of $377 million. It would have reported a $1.1 billion loss except for one-time gains from an accounting change and the sale of the G.M. Building in New York.

4/27/1991	Ford Plans to Cut Staff in Europe	"The Ford Motor Company said it would cut its salaried support staff in Europe by 30 percent over the next three years. The cuts mostly involve clerical and accounting workers and will not affect manufacturing and production staff, the company said. A Ford spokesman declined to give the number of jobs to be eliminated from Ford's total of 21,000 salaried workers in the auto maker's Ford of Europe subsidiary. """"We're reviewing our cost structure and need to make ourselves more competitive,"""" the spokesman said. """"Things are tough at the moment."""" Ford's total European work force was 126,300 in 1990. Staff workers in Britain totaled 44,000 in 1990, compared with 76,000 in 1979."
4/12/1991	Ford Slashes Dividend As Bad Times Worsen	As worse news piled on top of bad in the automobile industry recently, the Ford Motor Company tried hard to hold its dividend steady, even as G.M. and Chrysler passed some of the pain along to shareholders. But Detroit's third shoe dropped today as Ford, saying business conditions were even tougher than those usually encountered when car sales are soft, cut its quarterly payout nearly in half. Directors meeting at Ford headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., declared a second-quarter dividend of 40 cents a share, down from 75 cents, which had been paid since the first quarter of 1989. A dividend cut had been widely expected, and on the New York Stock Exchange today, Ford's shares were unchanged at $31.875.
4/11/1991	Ford Planning An Electric Car	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would build up to 100 electric-powered test cars by 1993 before going into mass production. Although the General Motors Corporation has said it will mass-produce electric cars and the Chrysler Corporation has built test vehicles, Ford said it would take a more cautious approach, with full-scale production not planned until the second half of the decade.
4/10/1991	Edsel Ford Becomes Finance Unit President	A familiar name was heard yesterday in the announcement of an important promotion at the Ford Motor Company. Edsel B. Ford 2d, the 42-year-old son of the late Henry Ford 2d and the great-grandson of the company's founder, was named the president of the Ford Motor Credit Company, the financing arm of the nation's No. 2 auto maker.
4/9/1991	Ford Reports No '90 Bonuses	Executives of the Ford Motor Company did not receive bonuses in 1990, according to the auto maker's annual proxy statement released today. More than 5,000 of the company's senior executives ordinarily receive bonuses when the company prospers. But profits plunged 77.6 percent last year, to $860.1 million, or $1.86 a share, on revenue of $97.65 billion.
4/5/1991	Japanese Improve Share as U.S. Car Sales Decline	Against a backdrop of sluggish sales in March, Japanese auto makers improved their share of the American automotive market at the expense of the Big Three domestic auto makers. In late March, car sales in the United States were off 7.8 percent, to 232,240, compared with 279,996 a year earlier. Light-truck sales were off 8 percent to 130,213, from 157,185 last year. There were 9 sales days in the latest period compared with 10 last year; percentage changes are based on the average daily rate.
4/2/1991	In Europe, Too, Auto Sales Sag	Executives of Europe's major car manufacturers speak of the Germans these days with reverence, and for good reason: The booming German market is all that separates the European car industry from disaster. Those who speak most reverently are executives of Volkswagen A.G. and the General Motors Corporation, whose companies are the strongest there. But with sagging markets elsewhere, those companies depending on the rest of Western Europe for most of their sales are threatened with a tough, if not terrible, year.
4/2/1991	First Nationwide Bank In Pact With Regulators	First Nationwide Bank, the savings institution owned by the Ford Motor Company, has signed an agreement with Federal regulators requiring it to overhaul its management practices and correct possible violations of savings rules. The accord, known as a supervisory agreement, also requires First Nationwide to take steps to assure that it will have adequate capital through the end of 1994 and that it will hold more board meetings and increase the board's supervision over management transactions.
3/30/1991	Auto Layoffs Decline	The Big Three auto makers plan to lay off just 12,050 hourly workers next week, the smallest weekly number of the year. The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation said Thursday that they would close all or parts of just six assembly plants to bring their products into balance with inventories.
3/29/1991	Ford's First Nationwide Bank Faulted	The Ford Motor Company said yesterday that a subsidiary, the First Nationwide Bank in San Francisco, had been criticized by Federal regulators after an examination and that it expected to sign an agreement soon to change some business practices and to pay a fine. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Ford said the agreement proposed by the Office of Thrift Supervision would include commitments by the bank to keep its capital base strong, maintain adequate reserves for loan losses, modify transactions with affiliates and change overall management policies.

The effort is the third of its kind by the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, which are also involved in joint research in plastics and batteries.
3/26/1991	U.S. Says Import Relief Is Unlikely for Detroit	White House officials said today that the Administration was unlikely to ask Japan for further restraints on auto exports to the United States to ease the financial plight of domestic auto makers, but that it could offer such assistance as a temporary easing of some regulatory requirements. The statement was made as the White House confirmed that the heads of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler met President Bush last Wednesday in an unannounced session. The auto executives met with Mr. Bush just a few hours before the President welcomed the Japanese Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, and agreed upon April 4 in Los Angeles for the next meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
3/24/1991	About Cars; Ownership, Through the Looking Glass	There is a delicious sense of voyeurism here. We are comfortable in the dark, a bunch of car writers and Ford executives, all of us fixated on the one-way mirror that allows us to watch and hear a dozen people talking about the pluses and minuses of their new cars. This is a clinic, one of a multitude that Ford and the other manufacturers do whenever they introduce a new car. In this case, the car is the '91 Escort, Ford's $2 billion replacement for the compact that has been a leading seller ever since the original rolled out of its first showroom in September 1980.

3/15/1991	Ford Tightens Terms On Rental Fleet Sales	The Ford Motor Company today revised the terms under which it sells cars to car-rental companies, reflecting a growing concern that new-car sales are being damaged by growing inventories of slightly used cars. Ford stipulated that rental fleets must keep cars in service for at least six months or 15,000 miles before they can be sold to Ford dealers, who then sell them to the public. Rental fleets must now keep cars for only four months, and many of them land on dealer lots with only a few thousand miles on them.
3/15/1991	Ford Plans to Revise Alpha Project	The Ford Motor Company said today that it planned to revamp its Alpha project, an advanced manufacturing program, by combining it with part of its product and manufacturing engineering operations. The action is tied to the retirement of John A. Manoogian, 69 years old, who was Alpha's general manager. David F. Hagen, 55, will move from his current post as general manager of Ford's engine division to head the enlarged organization, called Alpha Simultaneous Engineering.
3/2/1991	Auto Makers' Layoff Plans	The Big Three auto makers will have 38,950 auto workers on layoff next week as all or part of 17 assembly plants are closed because of slow sales and model changeovers. The number is down slightly from the 41,000 workers who were on layoff this week.
3/1/1991	Ford Plans to Reduce Salaried Work Force	"Faced with mounting losses, the Ford Motor Company announced plans today to cut its salaried work force through layoffs and early retirements, in an effort to save $3 billion by the end of the year. Speaking by closed-circuit television to the company's 53,000 salaried employees in the United States, Ford's chairman and chief executive, Harold A. Poling, said, """"It's becoming increasingly clear that some salaried layoffs are inevitable in the short term."
2/25/1991	Ford Leads in Car Layoffs	More than half of the 41,000 auto workers scheduled for temporary layoff this week will come from the Ford Motor Company. The Big Three auto makers said last week that they planned to shut down all or parts of 21 assembly plants, all because of lagging car and truck sales. Workers from the General Motors Corporation, Ford and the Chrysler Corporation who are affected by the shutdowns are eligible for benefit packages intended to give them 95 percent of their regular wages while laid off because of sales slowdowns. About 22,050 Ford assembly plant workers will be laid off this week. A Ford spokesman, Joel H. Pitcoff, said car plants in Chicago; Dearborn and Wayne, Mich., and Lorain, Ohio, would be shut down. Truck plants in Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis; Wayne; Norfolk, Va.; St. Paul, and its medium-duty Kentucky truck plant in Louisville will be closed. Truck plants in Edison, N.J., and Lorain will be working on one shift each instead of the usual two. G.M. is closing car plants in Linden, N.J.; Doraville, Ga.; Oklahoma City, and Ste. Therese, Quebec, and laying off one of two shifts at its Ypsilanti, Mich., factory. The only truck plant affected by a closing is the Scarborough, Ontario, van plnt, which will go to one from two shifts next week. In all, 14,000 G.M. workers will be laid off. Chrysler will lay off about 4,900 workers when it closes its car plants in Bramalea, Ontario, and St. Louis and its truck plant in Warren, Mich.
2/18/1991	Truck Slump Adds to Woes Of Big Three	The woes of the domestic automobile industry are being aggravated by a decline in the sales of some of its most profitable products: full-size pickup trucks and vans. Sales of light trucks, which include pickup trucks, vans and sports-utility vehicles, declined 7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, while automobile sales rose 1 percent. In the most recent 10-day sales period, sales of light trucks were off 31.2 percent.
2/15/1991	Big Losses For G.M. And Ford	Saying that war and recession had shattered consumer confidence, the nation's two biggest auto makers today reported huge fourth-quarter losses. General Motors, with a $1.62 billion deficit, and Ford, with $519 million, said sales had dried up faster than they could cut costs. Both companies said losses seem likely to continue for several months as they had seen no signs of a rebound in sales yet. Both also said they would intensify efforts to cut costs.
2/9/1991	More Cost Cutting Expected at Ford	"A senior executive of the Ford Motor Company said the automobile maker would intensify cost cutting in response to the industry's recession but would not lower capital spending as the General Motors Corporation has decided to do. Alexander J. Trotman, executive vice president of the No. 2 car maker and head of its North American operations, declined to elaborate on how Ford would further reduce costs but said, """"It's not business as usual."""" G.M., Ford and the Chrysler Corporation began cost-cutting programs in the late 1980's but have accelerated and deepened them as the American economy turned sour last year. Mr. Trotman's comments came at a press preview of the Chicago Auto Show, which opens on Saturday."
2/7/1991	S.&P. Cuts Ratings of Detroit's Big 3	Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit ratings of all three top domestic auto makers today, underscoring the rapidly unraveling conditions in the industry and raising the prospect of higher borrowing costs. Analysts said the impact of the downgrades would be minimal for the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, although borrowing may become marginally more expensive for the No. 1 and No. 2 domestic auto makers.
2/7/1991	Jaguar Is Planning To Cut Production	The Ford Motor Company's Jaguar subsidiary said it planned to stop production for two of every three weeks until the end of March to cope with declining sales. The decision means all 8,000 hourly production workers will be laid off during the halts at the luxury auto maker's three plants in Coventry and Birmingham, a company official said. The plants make a total of about 800 cars a week. Jaguar's worldwide sales were off 9.8 percent, at 42,754 cars, in 1990, the company said. Jaguar is scheduled to begin negotiations with trade unions on Thursday in a bid to cut about 1,000 jobs.
2/4/1991	Shutdowns Set By Car Makers	The nation's Big Three auto makers plan to shut 24 car and truck assembly plants this week, temporarily idling more than 62,000 workers because of a shortage of dealer orders, the companies said last week. The General Motors Corporation said that it would stop production at 11 of its United States and Canadian factories and that output at two plants would be cut in half. In all, 39,000 workers will be idled. The Ford Motor Company said 16,200 employees would be on temporary layoff as it shuts 10 North American car and truck assembly plants. The Chrysler Corporation said three plants would be closed, idling 7,150.
2/1/1991	3 Auto Makers In Battery Plan	"The Big Three United States auto makers said they had formed a joint effort to share the costs of developing batteries for electric vehicles. The Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation said they had pledged $35 million to the project. They said they want to raise $100 million annually by 1993 from the Government and electric utilities to support advanced battery research. The venture, called the United States Advanced Battery Consortium, plans to contract with battery manufacturers and other organizations to conduct research on advanced battery technology. The consortium, which had been expected, reflects a growing push by local governments in the country's most polluted areas to require """"ultra-clean"""" cars by the end of the century. Before auto makers can manufacture and market electric cars, however, they need batteries with enough power to accelerate vehicles to highway speeds and with enough storage capacity to keep vehicles running for 100 miles or more. John R. Wallace, director of Ford's electric vehicle programs, said the venture was inspired partly by a race with the Japanese."
1/25/1991	Ford Cash Search To Exclude Mazda	The Ford Motor Company, sitting atop a dwindling pile of cash, is intensifying a search for new sources of money, but it does not intend to sell its share of the Mazda Motor Corporation of Japan, a spokesman, Dick Routh, said. Mr. Routh was responding to a report in The Wall Street Journal today that Ford might reduce its dividend or sell all or part of its 25 percent Mazda stake to raise money. On June 30, 1988, Ford had $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand. By Sept. 30, 1990, the amount had been reduced to $5.6 billion, largely because of a $2.5 billion purchase of the British luxury carmaker Jaguar P.L.C. and the $3.35 billion acquisition of the Associates Corporation of North America, a lending company. Ford's results for the fourth quarter of last year and all of the year are due next month.
1/14/1991	Ford Extends Shutdowns	The Ford Motor Company will continue temporary shutdowns among its 16 United States assembly plants through the first quarter of this year as dealer orders trickle in at a feeble pace, the auto maker's chairman said last week. Most of the plants are expected to be included in the shutdowns, which should amount to a combined 36 weeks for the first three months of the year, the chairman, Harold A. Poling, said. Ford, like the other automobile makers, decides on a weekly basis which plants remain open. Last week, 11 of the 16 plants were shut down, and one was operating at half capacity. About 20,000 of Ford's 100,000 assembly plant workers covered by the United Automobile Workers contract were laid off.
1/11/1991	Ford Maintains Dividend, But May Cut Future Payouts	"The Ford Motor Company did not cut its dividend this time, but a top company official said it might do so in the future. Amid predictions that it might trim its quarterly payout, the company today declared the regular dividend of 75 cents a share for the first quarter of 1991. Allan D. Gilmour, Ford's executive vice president in charge of automotive operations, was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying the nation's No. 2 auto maker might consider lowering the dividend """"if the recession is a lot worse than normal."""" Speaking to reporters at the North American Auto Show in Detroit, Mr. Gilmour said it was """"too early to predict what's going to happen to the economy."""" Bonuses Are Canceled Although Ford will maintain its dividend, """"it doesn't appear likely at this point"""" that the company will make profit-sharing payouts to its hourly employees for 1990, Mr. Gilmour said."
1/10/1991	Debt Warning On Car Makers	"The Standard & Poor's Corporation said today that it had put the Big Three auto makers on notice that their corporate debt ratings could be lowered because of a worsening economic picture and specific problems at each company. Standard & Poor's placed the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation on its """"credit watch"""" list. Any subsequent lowering of the debt ratings would make it more difficult and more expensive for the companies to borrow money."
1/9/1991	Ford's Pockets Are No Longer Full	Just a couple of annual reports ago, the Ford Motor Company was selling cars and trucks so briskly and profitably that union officials moaned about the crush of overtime and some investors fretted that the nation's No. 2 auto maker was not investing its multibillion-dollar hoard of cash quickly enough. Ford executives have not heard such complaints lately. Now, like the rest of the domestic car industry, Ford is idling assembly lines and laying off workers in response to slow sales. Its financial strength, once the envy of corporate America, has declined to the point that Ford directors, who are to meet at company headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., on Thursday, are facing a tough decision on whether to conserve cash by cutting the dividend on common stock.
1/9/1991	Ford Retirement Mystery: One Explanation	Senior executives of the Ford Motor Company say that two years ago the company's board, anticipating the hard times that have since arrived, set in motion an executive succession plan that led to the early retirement of Donald E. Petersen, Ford's chairman and chief executive. In a leadership change that seemed mysterious at the time to all but a few insiders, Mr. Petersen announced his early retirement in early 1989 at age 63, about 18 months earlier than had been planned. Harold A. Poling, the company's chief operating officer, was promoted to take his place.
12/25/1990	Auto Makers Cutting Output	The Big Three auto makers plan to build 8.2 percent fewer cars and trucks in the first quarter of 1991 than they had originally projected, according to a published report. Ward's Autotmotive Reports, an industry newsletter, said G.M., Ford and Chrysler had reduced the output estimates made in December by 212,000 vehicles. The production cuts, which follow sharp declines in fourth- quarter output, would put first- quarter production about 1 percent below the first quarter of 1990, a weak period for American car and truck production. Industry analysts believe further production cuts are likely before the end of March. Last week, the General Motors Corporation and Chrysler said they would extend holiday vacations for about 41,650 workers because of big inventories and low orders. While none of the Big Three assembly plants are open this week because of the Christmas and New Year's holidays, the Ford Motor Company is the only American car maker that will not extend its shutdowns.
12/21/1990	Ford-Fiat Venture	The Ford Motor Company and Fiat S.p.A. of Italy signed agreements to form a company merging their Fiat Geotech and Ford New Holland Inc. tractor units. Fiat will own 80 percent of the company, while Ford will receive an undisclosed cash payment and retain 20 percent. The Fiat Geotech and Ford New Holland brand names will continue to be used. The new company's headquarters will be in London. Fiat Geotech has more than 13,000 employees worldwide, while Ford New Holland has about 18,000 workers around the world.
12/13/1990	G.M. and Ford Wary on '91; Gulf Outcome Called a Key	The clouded economic outlook is forcing the nation's two biggest auto makers to hedge their bets for 1991, with sales projections trimmed and the level of dividend payments perhaps in question. A crucial issue for the economy and Detroit, top executives of General Motors and Ford agreed today in year-end news conferences, will be the outcome of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
12/11/1990	Ford Curbs Customer Rebates	In a significant shift in marketing, the Ford Motor Company said today that it would stop offering cash rebates to buyers of most of its vehicles starting on Tuesday. Instead, discounts will be given to dealers for the next two and a half months, allowing them to choose whether to provide cash payments to buyers or use the price break in other ways. Ford executives said the company was halting most customer rebates, at least temporarily, because they had not proved effective in raising sales in what is currently a soft market for vehicles. Ford will continue rebates on five, mostly small models.
12/8/1990	A Ford-VW Mini-Van for Europe	The Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen A. G. of Germany are nearing agreement on a joint venture for European production of mini-vans. The vehicles' popularity is growing rapidly in Western Europe. Volkswagen's supervisory board approved plans for the factory on Nov. 16, and the tentative agreement will go to Ford's board of directors next week. The British newspaper The Financial Times said the plant was expected to have a production capacity of 150,000 to 200,000 vehicles a year and could involve an investment of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Ford and Volkswagen would not comment on those figures.
11/30/1990	Ford-Volkswagen Plan for Portugal	The Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen A.G. are negotiating to jointly produce a new multipurpose vehicle in Portugal, the president of Ford of Europe said. Lindsey Halstead said a final decision on the $2.5 billion project depended on continuing economic feasibility studies by the car makers, as well as support from the European Community. Mr. Halstead and Paul Weber, Volkswagen's director for foreign investment, met today with the Portuguese Prime Minister, Anibal Cavaco Silva.
11/15/1990	A Windshield Wiper Inventor Settles Suit Against Ford	"The inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper ended a 12-year-old patent-infringement lawsuit against the Ford Motor Company today by accepting $10.2 million from the auto maker. A Ford lawyer called the settlement """"extremely reasonable,"""" adding that the agreement resolved all disputes between the company and the inventor, Robert Kearns."
11/1/1990	LOSES $1.98 BILLION	The General Motors Corporation, acknowledging that it would not soon recapture lost ground in a glutted market and wary of harder times in the industry, moved today to close up to nine factories that employ tens of thousands of workers. The closings, which will cost G.M. billions of dollars, resulted in its biggest quarterly loss ever. G.M., the nation's largest company, said it would close four assembly plants permanently and established financial provisions that made the closing of five more likely over the next three years. Because of the enormous cost of shutting down the factories and laying off workers, the company reported a loss of $1.98 billion.
10/31/1990	Ford Reports 78.7% Decline In Earnings	The Ford Motor Company turned in its worst quarterly performance since the 1982 recession, it said yesterday, a 78.7 percent drop in third-quarter profit caused by weak automotive business and by a $44.6 million loss at First Nationwide, its savings and loan subsidiary. Ford's worldwide automotive business was hit by a variety of problems: costly incentives in the United States, production losses in Europe and anti-inflation measures in South America.
10/30/1990	DEVICE IN AIR BAGS PROMPTS RECALLS	The Ford Motor Company and three other manufacturers are recalling more than 55,000 late model cars after the discovery that scores of air bag inflators may fail to work in a head-on crash and may also release dangerous gases. Federal highway safety officials said late Friday that they knew of no incidents in which the problem air bags had failed. But they urged owners of the affected cars to limit use of the vehicles until they are inspected or repaired.
10/30/1990	Auto Makers May Take Big Charges	Financial analysts are speculating that the nation's two largest automobile companies will announce substantial quarterly write-offs this week, cutting into their already weak earnings. The Ford Motor Company, which announces its third-quarter results on Tuesday, may announce a charge against the earnings of First Nationwide Financial Corporation, a savings and loan association acquired in 1985 for $493 million. Analysts said they expected the First Nationwide write-off might be $100 million to $200 million, possibly depressing Ford's profits. Ford officials were not immediately available for comment today. Big G.M. Charge Seen The General Motors Corporation, to announce its earnings on Wednesday, may write off $750 million or more, as a one-time charge against its third-quarter earnings to cover the costs of closing four assembly plants that were idled indefinitely during the last three years.
10/29/1990	Jaguar Battle at a Turning Point	The new leaders of Jaguar Cars Ltd. are hoping that their first major victories are at hand in the battle to turn the antiquated British company into one of the world's biggest, most efficient makers of luxury cars. Early this week, the company's 9,000 production workers are expected to vote on labor contracts that would do away with practices that are ancient history at most other car companies. Management seems confident that a generous pay offer will persuade workers to accept the contracts and has hinted that the factories could be closed and Jaguars built elsewhere if they do not.
10/28/1990	Can Europe Save Ford's Future - Again?	OVER the years, the Ford Motor Company's European operations have been the goose that lays the golden eggs. Now, a question being asked inside and outside Ford is whether the goose is ailing and whether potential problems at Ford could cripple it. In the early 1980's, when Ford's North American car operations racked up billions of dollars in losses, the highly profitable European division saved the world's No. 2 car company.
10/25/1990	Ford's Credit Rating Drops a Notch	Moody's Investors Service yesterday lowered by a notch the long-term rating on about $45 billion in securities issued by the Ford Motor Company, the Ford Motor Credit Company and subsidiaries. The change leaves the car maker's rating at a high investment grade, but still serves as a signal that Moody's is concerned about the weakness in auto operations, the company's large capital requirements and the sizable acquisition debt that Ford accumulated during the year.
10/23/1990	Market Place; Are Auto Payouts Likely to Be Cut?	THE depressed state of the Big Three auto makers' shares is sparking a debate among analysts over whether investors now have an opportunity to reap unusually attractive dividends. The bullish perspective focuses on the relatively strong financial positions and liquidity of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler as evidence that auto makers will be able to pay dividends, despite prolonged softness in vehicle sales.
10/14/1990	Tense Talks at Chrysler	LEAD: Claiming the company has no money to meet union wage demands is a time-honored tactic of collective bargaining. But this time there seems to be little doubt that Chrysler Corporation management is telling autoworkers the truth about its precarious position.

9/14/1990	Early-Month Vehicle Sales Up by 2.5%	LEAD: Large rebates on many models drew buyers and lifted car sales above the trend for the year, as sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks increased 2.5 percent in early September over relatively weak sales a year ago. But sales of light trucks fell, a sign to some analysts that higher gasoline prices were beginning to take their toll.
9/14/1990	G.M. Seen as Nearing Agreement With Auto Workers on New Pact	LEAD: The General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers appear close to a three-year labor agreement that could improve job security benefits for the company's 300,000 hourly employees.

8/27/1990	Ford Plant Stays Closed	LEAD: The Ford Motor Company said Friday that an engine parts shortage would force it to extend a two-week shutdown of its Dearborn assembly plant for another two weeks, until Sept. 10. Initially, the factory, which makes Mustang automobiles, was closed because of a shortage of dealer orders. The shutdown this week was attributed to the parts shortage.
8/20/1990	Shutdown at Ford Plant	LEAD: The Ford Motor Company will extend last week's shutdown of its Dearborn assembly plant through this week because of a shortage of 2.3-liter engines for the Mustang model. A Ford spokesman, Jay Meisenhelder, said the shortage was a result of a switch to a slightly different 2.3-liter engine made in the company's Lima, Ohio, engine plant.
8/16/1990	Talking Deals;   Loral's Fast Move Wins a Ford Unit	LEAD: WHEN the Loral Corporation beat out giant competitors like Westinghouse Electric and Hughes Aircraft last month in bidding for the aerospace unit of Ford Motor, the victory had the air of David triumphing over Goliath.

KEARNS won a $5.2 million verdict against the Ford Motor Company for infringement on his patents for the intermittent windshield wiper.

LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about negotiations between the Big Three auto companies and the United Automobile Workers referred incorrectly to the union membership of workers at United States plants owned wholly or partly by Japanese car makers. At some plants, hourly workers are indeed represented by the United Automobile Workers. LEAD: Contract negotiations between the Big Three auto makers and the United Automobile Workers union, which have historically been fractious, show signs of being much tamer this year. But the apparent calm may be deceiving.

Is Backed On Plant Closing	LEAD: An arbitrator ruled that the General Motors Corporation was within its rights under a labor contract with the United Automobile Workers union in 1988 when it closed an assembly plant in Pontiac, Mich., that produced the Pontiac Fiero. But the subject of plant closings and job security will probably be a primary issue when Big Three and union negotiators begin bargaining for a new contract later this year.
3/30/1990	New Incentives Offered by Ford	LEAD: The Ford Motor Company fattened cash rebates and lowered interest rates on some company-financed loans on six car and truck lines.

1/5/1987	RECALL IS SOUGHT ON SOME FORD VANS	LEAD: The Government has intensified its investigation into reports of fuel tank fires on ambulances, but a consumer group said today the inquiry should be expanded to cover more than 320,000 vehicles in private use as well.
12/29/1986	A BRAZIL-ARGENTINA CAR GIANT	Despite the contrasting market conditions in Brazil, where new cars are in great demand, and in Argentina, where the automotive industry is in a slump, the Ford and Volkswagen subsidiaries in both countries have one thing in common: they are operating deeply in the red. Hoping to forge strength out of weakness and, above all, profits out of losses, the two giant corporations announced plans in November to pool their resources and merge their subsidiaries in South America's two leading economies in what some industry analysts have described as a creative attempt to remain in business. Owned 51 percent by Volkswagen and 49 percent by Ford, the new company will be known as Autolatina, potentially the world's 11th-largest car manufacturer, with a productive capacity of 900,000 vehicles a year, and a market share of 61 percent in Brazil and 34 percent in Argentina. The combined auto company will have assets worth $1.8 billion, annual sales of $4 billion and 75,000 employees working in 10 factories in Brazil and five in Argentina.
12/25/1986	Ford Recalling 1982 Escort And Lynx Autos for Pollution	The Ford Motor Company has begun recalling 226,000 Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx automobiles from the 1982 model year that exceed Federal and California air pollution standards, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday.
12/23/1986	Ford, Nissan Said To Plan Venture	The Ford Motor Company is discussing a United States-based joint venture with the Nissan Motor Company to produce V-8 and V-6 engines in the 1990's, American Metal Market-Metalworking News said.
12/20/1986	State 'Lemon' Law Is Upheld by Judge	The Ford Motor Company and other car manufacturers must abide by a state law extending warranties on all new cars but do not have to reimburse customers who already paid repair bills, a state judge ruled yesterday. Attorney General Robert Abrams began the lawsuit in March because Ford's warranty covered only the first 12,000 miles on an automobile, but charged $100 to fix breakdowns that occurred later.
12/12/1986	FORD AND CHRYSLER GIVE PLANS ON INSTALLING AIR BAGS BY 1990	Two of the top three United States automobile makers said today that they planned to equip at least half of their 1990 model cars with air bags. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation said in a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee that their plans to install inflatable bags to proect the driver in a crash as standard equipment were contingent on the Federal Government extending its 1989 deadline for protective devices for both front-seat occupants. The Transportation Department has already said it would grant the extension to induce auto makers to equip cars with air bags at least on the driver's side while continuing the development of bags or belts to protect the other front-seat passenger.
12/11/1986	S.&P. Increases Ratings for Ford	The ratings on the Ford Motor Company's short- and long-term debt were raised yesterday, the Standard & Poor's Corporation announced. Long-term senior debt of the auto maker and its financing subsidiary was raised to AA- from A. Ford Credit's subordinated debt was raised to A+ from A-, and its commercial paper was raised to the highest A-1+ from A-1. The rating agency noted that Ford, whose ratings were reduced earlier this decade, increased its earnings 39 percent in the first nine months of this year and is sustaining a return on capital of about 30 percent.
12/9/1986	Ford Recalls 74,000 Autos For Emission Control Flaws	The Ford Motor Company is recalling 74,000 1986 Ford Escort EXPs and Mercury Lynx cars because of emission control problems, the Environmental Protection Agency said today. The agency traced the problem to a change in engine calibration while the cars, all equipped with automatic transmissions, were still on the production line. Ford began notifying owners of the problem today and said dealers would repair the cars by rerouting vacuum lines and making several other changes.
12/8/1986	Ford-Nissan Talks Reported	Ford and Nissan have held talks involving a possible joint venture to build automobile engines in the United States, an auto industry official said here today. Two Japanese newspapers had reported that the Nissan Motor Company and the Ford Motor Company were negotiating on an agreement that would involve the production of V-8 engines, designed by Nissan, for Ford cars.
12/3/1986	COURT FAULTS E.P.A. ON RATING FUEL EFFICIENCY	A Federal appeals court panel held today that the Environmental Protection Agency erred when it revised its formula for measuring fuel efficiency in a way proposed by the nation's two largest car makers. The court ordered the agency to make adjustments in the fuel efficiency ratings that could cost the car makers about $300 million. The decision was by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. It was ruling on one of six separate legal actions that have been filed against the Reagan Administration by groups challenging efforts to weaken Federally mandated fuel economy standards for automobiles.
11/25/1986	Ford, VW to Link In South America	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would join forces with Volkswagen A.G. in Brazil and Argentina to form a new company that would be known as Autolatina. The new organization, based in Brazil, will merge car, truck and credit operations. Although the plans for the joint venture have been approved by the companies' respective directors, details have not been worked out. Ford said, however, that the venture would be an equal-management partnership, but that Volkswagen would control 51 percent of the venture's equity.
11/22/1986	TRANSPORTATION DEPT. URGES DELAY IN AIR BAG RULE	The Department of Transportation today proposed extending by as many as four years its deadline for installation of automatic restraint systems, such as air bags, in passenger cars. It also modified its restraint requirement. Currently, automobile makers are required to install automatic restraint systems, either air bags or automatic belts, in both the front driver and passenger seats on all cars by the model year 1990. That would be modified under the new proposal, which would require manufacturers to install only manual seat belts on the right front passenger seats if air bags are installed on the driver side.
11/22/1986	Ford Offers New Incentives	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would offer low-interest financing or a $300 rebate on 1986 and 1987 Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx models in response to a similar offer announced earlier by the Chrysler Corporation. ''This incentive is designed to maintain our strong sales momentum and protect our market share,'' said Louis Lataif, Ford vice president.
11/21/1986	Ratings Revised For Auto Makers	Duff & Phelps Inc., a Chicago-based rating service, has lowered debt ratings of the General Motors Corporation and its finance subsidiary, while raising ratings of the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and their finance subsidiaries. Ratings for G.M. and its subsidaries were reduced to D.&P.-4 from D.&P.-3, the equivalent of a drop to AA- from AA.
11/18/1986	G.M. and Ford To Cut Output	The nation's two largest auto makers said today that they would cut fourth-quarter production from earlier estimates. The General Motors Corporation attributed its cutbacks to slack demand following the end of bargain-basement financing deals on new cars.
11/12/1986	Ford Tractor Plant	The Ford Motor Company said it would close its last agricultural tractor plant in the United States by 1988 and transfer all tractor operations to Europe. Ford said the closing of the 12-year-old plant in Romeo, Mich., would cut costs and reduce capacity in the troubled agricultural tractor industry. The jobs of 650 hourly and 175 salaried workers would be eliminated, Ford said, but the division's headquarters would remain in Troy, Mich.
11/8/1986	G.M.'S OBSESSION WITH SIZE	''I have always believed in planning big, and I have always discovered after the fact that, if anything, we didn't plan big enough.'' Alfred P. Sloan Jr., ''My Years With General Motors.'' No company anywhere has celebrated the virtues of sheer bigness more than the General Motors Corporation, the world's largest auto maker. It was a philosophy shaped and spelled out by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the company's legendary chairman, who fashioned a loose confederation of struggling car ventures into America's largest industrial enterprise - one that supplied a car for every taste and pocketbook. By 1962, General Motors made one out of every two cars sold in America.
11/7/1986	FIAT BESTS FORD IN BID FOR ALFA	Italy's largest privately held corporation, Fiat S.p.A, won the battle for control of Alfa Romeo S.p.A. today, defeating a bid from the Ford Motor Company. The two state enterprises through which the Italian Government owns Alfa, announced this afternoon that their boards had voted unanimously to accept Fiat's offer to fully purchase the debt-ridden auto maker. Fiat executives said they proposed an investment of about 8 trillion lire, or $5.7 billion, to purchase Alfa's assets, pay its debts and turn around its fortunes.
10/24/1986	FORD NET MORE THAN DOUBLES	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its third-quarter earnings more than doubled, rising to $693 million, while the Chrysler Corporation's profits fell 25.7 percent, to $234.9 million. Ford's earnings increase, which exceeded most analysts' estimates, came on increased unit and dollar sales that reflected the addition of the Taurus and Sable midsize cars to its model lineup. The result was also enhanced by a one-time gain of $102 million from the sale of paint-making operations and an interest in the Starnet communications system. Unlike the other two leading auto makers, Ford did not mention the impact sales incentives had on third-quarter earnings. The General Motors Corporation, which reported its earnings Wednesday, said the incentives were a major contributor to its large operating loss. Chrysler said it was also hurt by cut-rate financing.
10/24/1986	ALFA ROMEO FIGHT INTENSIFIES	Despite the Ford Motor Company's size and international prowess, Fiat S.p.A. seems to be enjoying a distinct home field advantage in the contest to determine which of them takes over Alfa Romeo S.p.A., the state's ailing auto maker. The contest began early this month, when Ford announced that it had offered to link up with Alfa. Fiat said it would respond with a counteroffer, which it is expected to formally announce Friday.
10/22/1986	Ex-Ford Officer Joining Wells, Rich, Greene	William P. Benton, 62 years old, is joining Wells, Rich, Greene as its third vice chairman.
10/20/1986	Ford Recalls 1987 Lincolns	The Ford Motor Company has recalled about 6,200 1987-model Lincoln Town Cars to repair an engine wiring harness that the automaker said could cause a short circuit and fire.
10/2/1986	FIAT VOWS COUNTEROFFER	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it had offered to link up with Alfa-Romeo, Italy's state-owned car maker, presumably by acquiring a substantial interest. Fiat S.p.A. immediately stated that it was preparing a counteroffer. Alfa, best known for high-performance sports cars and stylish sedans, has registered 13 years of consecutive losses, including a loss of about $130 million in 1985. Neither Ford nor Alfa would release details of the proposal, but when negotiations between them began on May 21 Ford said it would seek a ''substanital share'' of Alfa's capital ''with an eventual option for the majority.''
10/2/1986	Technology; Automation That's Flexible	MORGAN WHITNEY calls it his ''technological sandbox,'' a place for engineers to play. It is the Ford Motor Company's robotics and automation applications consulting center in Dearborn, Mich., where Mr. Whitney is director. The work that goes on with a staff of 25 engineers is at the leading edge of a relatively new field known as flexible automation. ''The term means programmable equipment, as opposed to hard automation,'' Mr. Whitney said. ''It includes robotics, machine-vision systems, computer integrated techniques and artificial intelligence.''
9/20/1986	FORD AND TOYOTA TO RAISE '87 PRICES	Preliminary price increases on the Ford Motor Company's 1987 cars range from 3.2 percent to 9 percent above prices at the end of the 1986 model year, the company said today. Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., a subsidiary of the Japanese auto maker, said prices on 1987 models will average 3.3 percent more than on this year's models. Ford will announce final base prices for next year's cars on Oct. 3, according to Bill Carroll, spokesman for the nation's second-largest auto maker. Official prices ''historically are just about the same'' as the preliminary prices, Mr. Carroll said.
9/19/1986	Fiat Silent on Bid	Officials of Fiat S.p.A. remained silent about details of a new takeover bid for Alfa-Romeo, which is also being sought by the Ford Motor Company. A spokesman for Italy's largest auto maker and private employer also refused to give details about talks between the Prime Minister Bettino Craxi and Fiat's chairman, Giovanni Agnelli, held in Rome on Wednesday night. Mr. Agnelli reportedly sought support from the Government for taking over the state-controlled auto maker, for which Ford has made an offer for a 20 percent stake.
9/12/1986	Ford Car Leads Design Survey	Automotive design enthusiasts have picked an American car, the Ford Taurus, as the one they most likely would buy, according to a survey conducted by Design News magazine. The Ford Motor Company car replaced the Japanese-made Honda Accord as the leading new-car choice among designers. The Accord was first choice in the annual survey in 1985, 1984 and 1982.
9/5/1986	Ford Plans to Shut Ohio Forge Plant	The Ford Motor Company said it would begin closing its forge plant in Canton, Ohio, shutting it for good by late 1989 or early 1990. The company said it would begin helping the 826 hourly and 158 salaried employees find new jobs and that about 250 of them would be idled over the next six months. ''We deeply regret this action,'' said Max L. Jurosek, Ford's general manager of North American power-train operations, who said that high operating costs and the increasing popularity of front-wheel-drive vehicles made it impossible for the plant to be competitive.
8/30/1986	Ford Mexico Plant	The Ford Motor Company said that next year it will begin building 130,000 Tracer subcompact cars a year at a new plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, with 100,000 of those destined for the United States.
8/19/1986	DETROIT CAR MAKERS PREPARE FOR NEW ERA OF LEAN TIMES	The Big Three auto makers have started anew to cut jobs, close plants and revamp production to make attractive, trouble-free cars. They are doing so to arm themselves for a coming glut in the market. In the next three or four years, auto showrooms are likely to be flooded with new offerings, as manufacturers from all over the globe scratch for a share of the American market, easily the world's most lucrative. The result will be a consumer's delight but a producer's nightmare. It will mean a fresh assault on a domestic industry still recovering from the grievous loss of ground to Japanese imports in the early 1980's.
8/15/1986	Ford Acquisitive	The Ford Motor Company, with $7.1 billion in cash, remains interested in a non-automotive acquisition, its chairman, Donald E. Petersen, said. ''But our posture is one of patience, and I have no predictions,'' he said in an interview. Ford, the No. 2 automaker, was a losing bidder last year for the Hughes Aircraft Company, the military electronics giant that the General Motors Corporation bought. Mr. Petersen said Ford considers aerospace, electronics and financial services the three major diversification areas that ''make the most sense for us.''
8/8/1986	TESTS OF CAR SAFETY SHOW SOME GAINS	The Government's 1986 automobile crash tests showed poor performances by more a third of the 26 cars tested, including two new, low-cost imports and Ford's popular Taurus and Sable. The tests, conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, did show a trend of improved performance over recent years. Nevertheless, 10 of the 1986 model cars tested had scores indicating that one or both front-seat occupants probably would have been killed in a crash.
8/6/1986	10-Day Car Sales Rise 4.3%	The domestic automobile manufacturers today reported a 4.3 percent increase in car sales in the last 10 days of July and a 2.4 percent gain for the entire month, but a sharp drop in annualized selling rates prompted some analysts to warn that the new-car market may be softening. Sales of imported autos increased 13.9 percent and imported light trucks were up 5.4 percent, but domestic light-truck sales were off 7.1 percent. The strength of the imports was sufficient to lift the entire consumer-oriented motor vehicle market by 2.5 percent in July. ''We were expecting an annualized rate of about 8 million for the month instead of the 7.4 million we actually had,'' said Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Economics. ''It is another piece of evidence that the economy is beginning to slow down and that consumer confidence is eroding.''
8/3/1986	Last Vestige of a Silly Energy Policy	THIS fall, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration must once again decide whether to roll back the Federal fuel economy standards. General Motors and Ford have petitioned the Administration to lower the CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standard for model year 1987. Their eminently sensible reasons are that enforcing the standard would hurt consumers and introduce harmful economic distortions while largely failing to produce the energy savings that they were intended to promote. CAFE standards are the last major vestige of the misbegotten energy regulation of the 1970's. In 1973, just after the first energy crunch and well before the standards were established, the average new American car attained 14.2 miles per gallon. Under the law, passed in 1975, the average mileage of new cars rose in a series of steps, scheduled to top off at 27.5 m.p.g. in 1986.
7/25/1986	FORD NET UP 54.6% TO RECORD	The Ford Motor Company, perennially No. 2 in the American automobile industry, finished first in the second quarter of this year, one of the few times in recent decades it has earned more than the General Motors Corporation, the nation's leading auto manufacturer. Ford reported profits of $1.08 billion, or $4.02 a share, a 54.7 percent increase over the $698 million, or $2.50 a share, it earned in the second quarter of 1985. Per-share figures reflect a 3-for-2 stock split paid June 2.
7/22/1986	People	* David W. Scott has been promoted to vice president, public affairs at Ford Motor Co.
7/20/1986	Ford Workers on Strike At Factory Near Atlanta	Three thousand Ford Motor Company employees went on strike today, saying the company had accelerated the assembly line at its new plant here without hiring more workers. The suburban Atlanta plant, which reopened in October after a five-month, $250 million retooling, is one of two in the United States that makes Ford Taurus and Mercury Sables.
7/11/1986	FORD PLANS SHOULDER HARNESSES FOR REAR SEAT BELTS	The Ford Motor Company said today that it planned to introduce seat belts with shoulder harnesses for the rear seats of its passenger cars in the ''next few years.'' The company declined to be more specific. The Ford announcement came a day after Government and industry sources said that a National Transportation Safety Board report would assert that back-seat passengers might be safer in some automoble accidents when they were not wearing the lap seat belt.
7/9/1986	BOOKS OF THE TIMES	FORD: The Men and the Machine. By Robert Lacey. Illustrated. 778 pages. Little, Brown. $24.95. ''FORD'' is a workmanlike assemblage by an English writer of a great American family saga. Robert Lacey carries us briskly through almost a century of corporate fortunes (Model A, Model T, Mustang) and misfortunes (Edsel, Pinto). He makes admirably clear the technical and marketing considerations that have gone into each new or revised model and provides plenty of opportunity along the way to view the changing social landscape. The episodes that particularly excite Mr. Lacey, whose specialty until now has been books about British royals and aristocrats, are the personal ones, especially the tortured relations between Henry Ford and his son, Edsel, the power struggle between Henry Ford II and Lee Iacocca, and the second Henry's occasional trading in of one wife for another.
7/5/1986	Ford Raises Prices by 2.9%	The Ford Motor Company raised its car prices by an average of 2.9 percent today, but also announced new buyer incentives that include loans at 6.9 to 9.9 percent interest, or cash bonuses of up to $600. Ford said it made the moves to keep up with the General Motors Corporation, which recently announced discounted interest rates of 5.9 to 8.9 percent on most cars and many light trucks.
7/4/1986	JUNE 21-30 AUTO SALES ROSE 21.2%	Sales of new American-made cars rose 21.2 percent in late June from the comparable period of last year, a time when sales were soft. Light-truck sales were also up, the makers said today, by 10.5 percent. Industry analysts said much of the strength came from buyers taking advantage of incentive programs that were to expire at the end of June or early this month. For all of June, sales of domestically produced autos increased 8.8 percent and light-truck sales were 3 percent above June 1985. The annual selling rate for cars was 8.1 million, up from 7.6 million in June 1985 but down slightly from an 8.2 million rate in May. The rate is seasonally adjusted.
7/3/1986	Kia Approves Deal With Ford	Shareholders of the Kia Industrial Company approved the Ford Motor Company's proposal to buy 10 percent of the South Korean auto maker's stock, Kia officials said.
6/27/1986	Ford in Kia Deal	The Ford Motor Company said it planned to buy 10 percent of the Kia Industrial Company of South Korea, which will produce mini-cars for Ford dealers in the United States. The stock purchase by Ford is subject to approval by the South Korean Government and Kia stockholders, who will hold a special meeting next Wednesday in South Korea, according to a Ford spokesman, Ken Brown.
6/22/1986	Ford's Promising Offer on Airbags	It's the law: By 1990 all new cars must come equipped with automatic safety restraints. Automakers must still decide, however, whether they will comply by providing ''passive'' belts or inflatable airbags, which are more effective and more expensive. Ford now says it would choose airbags for drivers if Washington relaxes the safety-restraint rule for passengers. The Feds ought to meet Ford at least part way.
6/19/1986	Market Place; For Analysts, Ford Is No. 1	SHARES of the Big Three automotive companies have pulled back recently, after speeding ahead between late 1985 and this spring. Wall Street analysts are right now picking their favorite entries in this giant industry, and are also looking down the road, as they estimate profits for the soon-to-end June quarter. Ford seems to be holding the lead in investment recommendations over General Motors and Chrysler. At the start of 1986, analysts generally had viewed stock market prospects for Ford and Chrysler as running ahead of those for G.M. ''Our position on the stocks remains the same,'' summed up Gary Glaser of the First Boston Corporation. ''We aggressively recommend purchase of Ford, we recommend purchase of General Motors for good relative performance near term, and we would continue to avoid Chrysler shares.''
6/19/1986	Ford Tractors To Reorganize	The Ford Motor Company said it would reorganize its domestic tractor operations into a wholly owned subsidiary with operational control of the company's New Holland business. The company will be called Ford New Holland Inc., taking the name of the agricultural implements business that Ford bought from the Sperry Corporation earlier this year.
6/17/1986	Ford's Brazil Chief Gains Truck Post	The Ford Motor Company yesterday announced a new general manager for its truck operations and a new director of company research. The new truck executive is Edward E. Hagenlocker, currently president of Ford of Brazil. He succeeds Robert A. Lutz, a well-known Ford executive who left earlier this month to head truck operations at Chrysler and that company's efforts to revive its international operations.
6/17/1986	Ford Milestone at 83	The Ford Motor Company, which marked its 83d birthday today, said it would produce a record 10 millionth vehicle at a single factory. The milestone car, a silver Ford Thunderbird, will be built Tuesday at the 28-year-old Lorain, Ohio, assembly plant near Lake Erie, said Ford, which planned a ceremony there. Lorain's first vehicle, produced in 1958, was an F-100 pickup.
6/14/1986	Ford, VW Discuss South America Tie	The Ford Motor Company and West Germany's Volkswagen A.G. are discussing ways for their subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina to cooperate in manufacturing cars and light trucks, the companies announced today. In a statement, the companies said the talks were aimed at ''the better utilization of existing facilities and resources,'' including the ''introduction of new technologies and manufacturing efficiencies'' to achieve higher economies of scale and lower costs.
6/13/1986	FORD PROPOSES INSTALLING AIR BAGS FOR DRIVERS IN MOST CARS BY 1990	The Ford Motor Company proposed today to install air bags on the driver's side of a majority of its new passenger cars by the 1990 model year if the Government would drop a more stringent requirement. In a petition to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has been wrestling for more than a decade with the air-bag issue, Ford said that the cars would have manual seat belts for all passengers. A rule adopted by the safety agency two years ago requires automatic restraint systems like air bags or self-fastening seat belts for drivers and passengers in the front seats of all automobiles by the 1990 model year. The rule would be dropped if, by April 1, 1989, states covering two thirds of the population require seat belts to be used. Such laws have been adopted by 27 states, although not all conform to the specific criteria set forth by the safety agency.
6/11/1986	NEW ACTION URGED IN FORD GEAR CASE	The General Accounting Office recommended today that the Government take further action to reduce accidents caused when certain Ford automobiles equipped with automatic transmissions slip from park into reverse. The accounting office, an investigative arm of Congress, said fatalities had not declined despite a settlement reached in 1980 by the Department of Tranportation and the Ford Motor Company after an investigation of the problem by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration. The settlement required Ford to mail letters to owners of 22 million Ford automobiles from the model years 1970 through 1979, urging them to use proper parking procedures before leaving their vehicles. The letters included labels to be placed on steering columns to remind drivers to put the gear in park and put the hand brake on.
6/4/1986	Ford Official Joins Chrysler Operation	Robert A. Lutz, who kept Ford's European operations profitable when the company's domestic sales plunged in the early 1980's, will take on that territory for Chrysler and Lee A. Iacocca, one of his former colleagues at Ford. Mr. Lutz joins the No. 3 car company's efforts to revive the international operations that were virtually eliminated during Chrysler's fight for survival in the late 1970's. In addition to Europe, Chrysler has interests in Asia and Mexico. Mr. Lutz will also head truck operations and component business operations at Chrysler Motors, the company's sales unit.
5/31/1986	NEW LOOK PAYS OFF FOR FORD	The early returns are in, and the Ford Motor Company's $3 billion Taurus gamble appears to be paying off. Introduced in the last days of last year after extensive delays, the European-looking Ford Taurus and its sister model, the Mercury Sable, are keeping two factories going at full tilt. Ford sold 99,500 of the midsized cars through May 10 and has orders for 120,000 more. ''I think you have to call the Taurus program an unqualified success, except for the delays in getting it to market,'' said David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert.
5/24/1986	Ford Acquisition	The Ford Motor Company said it had completed the second phase of the acquisition of the Sperry Corporation's New Holland agricultural equipment unit.
5/22/1986	FORD IN TALKS FOR ALFA ROMEO STAKE	The Ford Motor Company said today that it was negotiating with the Italian automobile company Alfa Romeo about acquiring as much as a controlling interest in Alfa's stock. Under the proposed agreement, Alfa would retain what a statement released by Ford described as its ''unique Italian identity.'' Ford said a study into the feasability of the transaction would take at least two months.
5/22/1986	Scrutiny of Deal Seen	Alfa Romeo, which has recorded 13 years of consecutive losses, has been looking for a healthy partner to help revive its fortunes for several years, but market analysts said today that the announcement of a potential marriage with Ford had come as surprise. Using only 36.7 percent of its productive capacity, Alfa Romeo produced 170,000 autos last year, most of them midpriced sedans and high-performace cars.
5/12/1986	New Amfac Head Cites Problems	Ronald R. Sloan was a vice president at a frozen potato company called Lamb-Weston when Amfac Inc., a huge diversified services corporation, bought it in 1971. Things worked out well for Mr. Sloan, whose election as president and chief executive of Amfac becomes effective today after the annual meeting. Mr. Sloan, who is 52, succeeds Ralph A. Van Orsdel Jr., 69, who becomes chairman of the executive committee. A graduate of Oregon State University and the Stanford Executive Program, Mr. Sloan has been executive vice president and chief operating officer. Henry A. Walker Jr. is the company's chairman.
5/11/1986	GROUP RATES CARS ON COSTS OF CRASH REPAIRS	An insurance industry group has found that costs of automobile repairs resulting from crashes at 5 miles an hour varied widely depending on the type of car and the angle of the crash. Over all, the group said the Ford Escort showed the best results and the new Yugoslavian import, the Yugo, the worst. The group, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, tested 23 cars. Nine suffered no damage in crashes in which the car hit a barrier straight on, either driving forward or backing up. All 23 types of cars were damaged in angled crashes into a barrier and in rear crashes into a pole.
5/9/1986	Ford Picks Manager For Alpha Project	John A. Manoogian, who started as a drafting apprentice at the Ford Motor Company in 1940, has been named manager of the company's advanced manufacturing program. The program, known as the Alpha Project, is Ford's attempt to match the Japanese in costs and quality in small cars, much like General Motors' Saturn program.
5/6/1986	Ford, Chrysler Trucks	The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, while pledging to hold the line on car prices, have raised prices on most of their small trucks without making a public announcement, the companies have confirmed. Ford's price increases, effective April 21, ranged from 1.7 percent to 2.9 percent, John Sieg, a company spokesman, said. Chrysler's increases, effective April 29, averaged 2.3 percent, according to Douglas Nicoll, a Chrysler spokesman.
5/1/1986	Ford Cuts Rates	The Ford Motor Company today announced lower financing rates on new cars, following a similar move last week by the General Motors Corporation.
4/26/1986	Patents; Jump-Start Mechanism	The Ford Motor Company received a patent this week assigned by a West German inventor for an indefinitely variable transmission mechanism that can give a car a jump start or a slow push. Dieter Hahne of Bergisch-Gladbach was granted patent No. 4,583,423. Ford has no present plans to offer the invention.
4/25/1986	FORD PROFIT DOWN 7% IN QUARTER	The Ford Motor Company reported today that first-quarter earnings were $728 million, or $4.05 a share, a decline of 7 percent from the $783 million, or $4.20 a share, earned in the 1985 quarter. The Ford results, which were better than many analysts had predicted, followed the pattern set earlier this week by the other major auto makers of slightly lower, but still robust, profits. The company said the decline was ''more than accounted for'' by the cost of developing new products and the financing incentives it has been offering to increase sales.
4/22/1986	FORD INCENTIVES	The Ford Motor Company joined its major competitors in offering financing rates as low as 6.9 percent.
4/17/1986	Iveco Truck Deal	Ford Motor Ltd., the British arm of the American auto maker, and Iveco, the truck unit of the Italian manufacturer Fiat, said they would merge heavy-truck operations in Britain. Iveco Ford Truck Ltd. will make vehicles of more than four tons in Britain, the companies said. The agreement takes effect July 1.
4/11/1986	Ford Splits Stock, Raises Dividend	The Ford Motor Company announced a 3-for-2 stock split, raising the number of shares outstanding to 270 million from 180 million.
4/4/1986	10-DAY AUTO SALES FALL 21.5%	Sales of American-made cars slumped 21.5 percent in late March and 15.5 percent for the full month, as the modest interest-rate incentives of the Big Three evidently failed to entice buyers. Sales of imported cars increased 21.8 percent for the month from March 1985. The softening of the market for domestic cars forced the General Motors Corporation this week to cut back its ambitious production program, which the company had been counting on to recapture its historic share of the American market. Many analysts and industry executives are predicting that G.M. will have to mount an expensive new incentive campaign to sell cars already in stock.
4/2/1986	FORD IS SET TO REVISE EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its chief executive was paid $1.69 million in salary, bonus and stock options last year, but it also said the company was planning a new compensation plan that would emphasize accumulation of stock rather than short-term cash bonuses. Ford is the first of the Big Three auto companies to report executive compensation in what is expected to be another big bonus year for the domestic auto industry. The three companies combined earned $8.1 billion in 1985, second only to the record $9.8 billion earned in 1984.
3/28/1986	PURCHASE BY FORD	The Ford Motor Company's purchase of the New Holland farm equipment business has been completed in the United States, Canada, Belgium and Spain, but separate closings are pending in seven other countries, Ford said. The auto maker announced in October that it would buy the Sperry Corporation's New Holland division, based in New Holland, Pa., for $330 million plus $110 million in liabilities.
3/27/1986	Ford Credit Notes	A $300 million financing by the Ford Motor Credit Company is offering 7 7/8 percent, three-year notes at a price of 99.85 to yield 7.931 percent, through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The notes, which are noncallable, are rated A-1 by Moody's and A by S.&P.
3/24/1986	A FORD CHANGE SET IN GERMANY	The J. Walter Thompson Company, which has been serving the Ford Motor Company, its biggest client, in 23 countries, is losing it in West Germany, an executive at the subsidiary's headquarters in Cologne confirmed Friday. Billings are between $30 million and $40 million.
3/21/1986	FORD INCREASES ITS NOTE OFFERING	The Ford Motor Company is offering $250 million of 8 7/8 percent notes due 2006 at a price of 99 to yield 8.984 percent through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The notes, which are noncallable for the life of the issue, are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, and they yield 89-hundredths of a percentage point more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. Underwriters said that because of strong investor demand, the size of the offering had been increased from $200 million.
3/18/1986	FORD SHIFTS CONFIRMED	The Ford Motor Company today announced that, as expected, Robert A. Lutz, chairman of Ford of Europe, would be brought to the United States to run the company's truck operations. Philip E. Benton Jr., most recently in charge of diversified products, was elevated to executive vice president for international automotive operations.
3/17/1986	SHIFTING OF OFFICERS EXPECTED AT FORD	As part of a major series of changes among its top international executives, sources close to the Ford Motor Company said that the company was expected to announce today that Philip E. Benton Jr., an executive vice president in charge of Ford's diversified products operations, will be put in charge of international automotive operations. Mr. Benton, 58 years old, will fill a post that effectively has been vacant for nearly two years, when Robert A. Lutz, an executive vice president who had held the job, was sent back to Britain for a second tour of duty as chairman and chief executive of Ford of Europe Inc. As part of the changes to be announced today, the sources said that Mr. Lutz, 54, would return to Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., to run the company's North American truck operations.
3/16/1986	NEW YORK SUES FORD ON REPAIR CHARGES ON SOME NEW CARS	New York State has filed suit against the Ford Motor Company, charging that it violated the state's ''lemon law'' by requiring customers to pay a $100 fee for repairs on new cars. The suit, filed this week by State Attorney General Robert Abrams, charges that Ford illegally requires consumers to pay the $100 deductible for certain repairs on cars less than two years old or with fewer than 18,000 miles. The state's 1984 ''lemon law'' requires manufacturers to make any such repairs free.
3/13/1986	Government Rejects Ford Bid On 2,000 Cars With Air Bags	The Federal Government will not buy cars equipped with air bags this year because it was unable to agree on a price with the Ford Motor Company, Federal officials said Tuesday.
3/12/1986	A FORD STAKE IN CERADYNE	The Ford Motor Company said today that it had paid about $10 million for a stake of about 11 percent in Ceradyne Inc. of Irvine, Calif. Ford and Ceradyne have agreed to set up a new company, Ceradyne Advanced Products Inc., to develop automotive uses for ceramics.
3/11/1986	108 MORE VIETNAM DEAD TO BE LISTED AT MEMORIAL	The names of 108 Americans killed in the Vietnam War will be added next month to the 58,022 names of the dead and missing already etched into the Vietnam Veterans Memorial here, leaders of the memorial's search committee said today. The roster on the glistening black granite monument wall will then total 58,130, which will probably be the final figure, according to Jan C. Scruggs, the founder and president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. The 108 were initially omitted because they did not die in the Vietnam combat zone, but the Defense Department changed its rules to include two new categories of war casualties: those killed as a result of aircraft accidents while returning from combat missions over the war zone or on their way there, and those who died of wounds received in Vietnam.
3/2/1986	WHY NOT BANK WHERE YOU BUY A CAR?	THE Ford Motor Company has acquired First Nationwide, a multibillion-dollar savings and loan with offices in several states. This acquisition most likely will raise two specters that sporadically haunt the discussion of United States banking - fears of mixing banking and commerce and the creation of giant corporations. Are acquisitions of this sort contrary to the public interest? Imagine an even larger combination than Ford-First Nationwide -say, Citibank and General Motors. Citimotor (Motorciti is too familiar) would be larger than many nations.
3/2/1986	WHY FORD SHOULDN'T BE YOUR BANKER	AS the president of a savings bank, I have been dismayed by the lack of attention paid to the Ford Motor Company's acquisition late last year of First Nationwide, a well-managed thrift institution with assets of $11 billion. I am dismayed because this transaction may signal the beginning of an era of marked acceleration of concentration in economic power. Ford already owns the Ford Motor Credit Corporation, after General Motors Acceptance Corporation the second-largest finance company in the world, with $24 billion in assets -more than all but 13 United States banks. First Nationwide has branches in California, Florida, New York and Hawaii, and it franchises financial services in 20 states through 24 banks with another $18 billion in assets. If Ford's strategy includes a full-service, nationwide bank, Ford Motor Credit and First Nationwide provide an impressive foundation.
2/28/1986	CHRYSLER AND FORD OFFERING INCENTIVES	The Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, responding to buying incentives introduced last week by the General Motors Corporation, today announced their own plans intended to attract new-car buyers. Ford, like G.M., is offering 9.9 percent financing on a wide range of cars and trucks. Chrysler, however, has shifted from offering either low-rate financing or a rebate, to only a rebate of $500 or $1,000 per car.
2/14/1986	FORD AND CHRYSLER FINISH STRONG YEAR	The American automobile industry wrapped up the second-most-profitable year in its history today, as the Ford Motor Company reported 1985 earnings of $2.52 billion and the Chrysler Corporation reported $1.64 billion. Added to the $4 billion reported earlier by the General Motors Corporation, it brought the Big Three's total profit for the year to $8.16 billion - a sum exceeded only by the $9.8 billion the industry earned in 1984. The Ford and Chrysler yearly figures were somewhat crimped by their respective fourth-quarter results: Chrysler posted a big decline over the comparable 1984 period; Ford's earnings were virtually a rerun of its 1984 quarter. Most industry analysts say the auto companies will be hard pressed to match the performance of the last two years in the future, as new entrants and added production capacity make the American car market more competitive.
2/7/1986	Britain Abandons Austin Rover Plan	Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government backtracked today under heavy criticism and said it had abandoned talks about selling the Austin Rover car company to the Ford Motor Company.
2/7/1986	FORD OFFICIALS SEE A HEALTHY INDUSTRY	Car and truck sales will decline slightly from the peaks set in 1985, but the industry should remain healthy, top sales executives of the Ford Motor Company predicted today. Louis E. Lataif, Ford's vice president for marketing, predicted that 10.4 million cars and 4.4 million trucks would be sold in 1986, down from 11 million cars and 4.7 million trucks last year.
1/29/1986	Ford Cancels Ad Campaign Linked to Shuttle Program	The Ford Motor Company canceled its national advertising campaign today that links its Aerostar minivan to the space shuttle.
1/26/1986	AIR BAGS APPEARS IN '86	DESPITE the imminent arrival of several high-technology automobile safety devices, the most closely watched safety issue today concerns a pair of old systems -air bags and automatic seat belts. Auto manufacturers have generally opposed passive restraints like seat belts that close automatically or air bags, which pop out of dashboards in crashes to cushion people in front seats. They contended the devices were too expensive and there was not enough demand for them.
1/19/1986	A LITTLE HELP FOR G.M. AND FORD	Ignoring the complaints of consumer groups and the Chrysler Corporation, the Department of Transportation said last week that it would propose retaining for an additional two years the lower fuel-economy standards it granted General Motors and Ford last summer. Diane Steed, who heads the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the fuel-economy requirements for 1987 and 1988 cars - set by legislation enacted in 1975, when memories of gasoline lines were still fresh - appeared to be too tough.
1/5/1986	FORD PUTTING CHIPS ONSET OF TWINS	smooth (smooth) adj. fitting together, even. a) having an even or level surface; having no roughness or projections that can be seen or felt b)free from interruptions, obstacles, difficulties, etc. [ Slang ] very pleasant, attractive, or enjoyable. INDEED. Look up ''smooth'' in the dictionary, and you just might find a picture of one of Ford Motor Company's twins, the Ford Taurus or the Mercury Sable. The cars are new and they are important. They mean a lot, both to shoppers, who now have a large and thoroughly pleasing front-wheel-drive option, and to the manufacturer, which is basing its big-car hopes for the next decade on the Taurus/Sable platform.
12/31/1985	Market Place;   G.M. May Lag Behind Rivals	AS Detroit's Big Three auto makers head into 1986, stock market prospects for Chrysler and Ford are running ahead of those for General Motors, according to most Wall Street analysts. Reflecting these judgments, shares of both Ford and Chrysler traded recently at record prices on the New York Stock Exchange. Ford and Chrysler are selling at no more than four times their trailing 12-month earnings. And both companies have announced stock repurchase programs - a strategy that appeals to investors, since it enhances per-share profits.
12/27/1985	New Ford Cars In Low Supply	The Ford Motor Company yesterday officially introduced its new, highly publicized midsized automobiles, the Ford Taurus and the Mercury Sable, but the models are already in tight supply at the dealerships. The company said it had received 103,000 customer orders at the retail level since disclosing its plans for the cars almost a year ago.
12/27/1985	FORD MATCHES 7.9% G.M. RATE	The General Motors Corporation opened a new round of automobile pricing competition today by announcing 7.9 percent financing on some of its cars and trucks, and the Ford Motor Company quickly followed suit with the same incentives. G.M., the nation's No. 1 auto maker, announced it would offer the lower rates to consumers on about 40 percent of its vehicles. Ford announced a few hours later that it, too, would offer 7.9 percent financing on about 40 percent of its cars. ''Essentially, it is a competitive response to help us maintain our sales momentum,'' said John Seig, a spokesman for Ford, the second-largest domestic auto maker.
12/23/1985	Trucks and Buses Recalled	The Ford Motor Company is recalling about 57,000 1984 and 1985-model medium-duty trucks and school buses equipped with hydraulic brakes to check for faulty brake systems. A company spokesman, Jim Bright, said Friday that about 5,900 of the affected vehicles are based on the B-series chassis.
12/8/1985	FORD JOINS MINIVAN CARAVAN	THE third shoe has dropped, so to speak, and Ford's new Aerostar minivan hs arrived, taking its place with Chrysler's popular Voyager/Caravan twins and Chevrolet's recently introduced Astro. All have strengths and weaknesses, and it is interesting to compare them - an exercise that is gaining more and more practitioners as the minivan chips away at the conventional station-wagon market. The newest part of the triptych is well named, since its sleek lines make it the most aerodynamic of the three, and Ford is capitalizing on the silhouette with advertising that emphasizes the front end's resemblance to the space shuttle. Aerostar's nose poked into New York for the first time two years ago at the Coliseum auto show, and its nifty wind-cheating look drew much attention.
12/6/1985	Advertising;   Lincoln-Mercury Gets Minority Agency	Unlike the Ford division, its sister operation in the Ford Motor Company, Lincoln-Mercury has not had an independent specialty agency to do advertising for minority markets.
12/6/1985	Ford Adopts Incentives	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would offer sales incentives on one line of subcompact cars, adopting a stance similar to that of the General Motors Corporation and avoiding the wider incentives being offered by Chrysler Corporation. Ford said its Ford Motor Credit Company subsidiary would offer financing with a 7.9 percent interest rate on the Escort and EXP models and the Mercury Lynx.
12/1/1985	FORD PUTS ITS FUTURE ON THE LINE	CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY IN Lou Ross's fifth-floor office in the steel-and-glass headquarters of Ford Motor Company's North American Automotive Operations in Dearborn, Mich. It is in keeping with the professorial appearance of the man who manages the production and sales of all the company's cars and trucks in the United States and Canada. It is Oct. 4, and Ross has been wrestling with a major problem for the last several weeks. After spending six years and $3 billion, the No. 2 American auto maker is about to introduce its 1986 line of new, European-styled models, a radical departure from Ford's big, boxy machines of the past. Ross and other executives hope the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable will recapture some of the upscale American market the company has lost to imports. Originally, the plan was to introduce the sleek, midsize cars in autumn, traditionally the debut season for new cars. Dozens of television commercials, some with 1960's-style rock soundtracks and romantic settings geared to appeal to aging (and well-to-do) baby boomers, are in the can and waiting to be aired. Marketing specialists, eager to start their sales program, are pressing for a date.
11/19/1985	U.S. IS FACED BY THREE LAWSUITS TO RESTORE TIGHT AUTO FUEL RULES	The Reagan Administration's decision to roll back Federal fuel efficiency standards for new cars is being challenged in court even as the two largest car companies prepare strategies so they can comply with the relaxed requirements. The court actions are the latest move in a 15-year controversy over whether the Federal Government should require Detroit to make cars that use less gasoline. They come less than 90 days after the Administration eased the average fuel standard for the fleets of 1986 models to 26 miles a gallon from 27.5 miles a gallon. In three suits last week, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston, the state of California and a coalition of consumer groups sought reinstatement of the tougher standards. The cases were filed in the United States Court of Appeals in Washington.
11/15/1985	FORD WILL REPURCHASE 20 MILLION MORE SHARES	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would buy 20 million of its common shares, continuing a stock repurchase program. It also said it was exploring ways to take more advantage of the value of its credit and aerospace subsidiaries, perhaps by spinning off and selling shares in the units. Company officials said the actions were being taken because of the low value the stock market has put on Ford's shares, despite its current prosperity. Ford earned a hefty $1.8 billion in the first three quarters of 1985, but its shares have been selling for about $48 each, which is barely more than four times annualized per share earnings.
11/8/1985	The Editorial Notebook;   Air Bags Make It to the Showroom	Cheers for the Ford Motor Company for making it possible to buy an American car with an air-bag safety restraint. The company will soon offer the devices as options on its 1986 Tempo and Topaz compacts. The decision could mark the beginning of the end of Detroit's long, bitter campaign against this life-saving technology.
11/2/1985	PATENTS; Transmitting Data In Computer Network	A data communications system to provide transmission between a number of local computer networks was patented this week for the Ford Motor Company. Patent 4,550,402 was granted to Melvin G. Gable and two other research scientists on the company's staff. The invention was described by a spokesman as a very high-speed data communications system for facilitating the switching of small packs of data between or among local area networks, through a single transfer device made of a number of parallel conductors. It was developed in a project undertaken for Ford Aerospace and Communications Inc.
11/2/1985	FORD TO OFFER AIR BAGS AS OPTIONS ON '86 COMPACTS	The Ford Motor Company will soon offer air bags as optional equipment on one line of compact cars, sources within the company said today. It will be the first time that air bags have been available to the general public in an American car since the mid-1970's. The official announcement of the air-bag program is to come on Monday in a speech by Donald E. Petersen, the chairman of Ford. The decision by the No. 2 automaker breaks Detroit's united front against the safety devices.
10/26/1985	FORD'S PROFIT FALLS 17.5%, INCENTIVE PLAN IS CITED	The Ford Motor Company reported today that it earned $313.1 million, or $1.70 a share, in the third quarter, down 17.5 percent from the $379.7 million, or $2.05 a share, earned in the comparable period in 1984. The company attributed the decline to the cut-rate financing programs that were offered during the period to stimulate car sales, and to the cost of introducing new models. Worldwide sales fell 2 percent in the period, to $11.6 billion, from $11.8 billion. Unit sales also fell 2 percent, to 1,241,119 vehicles.
10/25/1985	FORD ACQUIRES A STAKE IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	The Ford Motor Company, following the example of the General Motors Corporation, announced today that it had purchased minority interests in two companies that specialize in the development of artificial intelligence computer systems. Ford said it would invest up to $28 million for up to 10 percent equity in each of two companies - the Inference Corporation of Los Angeles and the Carnegie Group Inc. of Pittsburgh. Both companies are privately owned. The investment also includes contracts for systems development.
10/24/1985	WEEKEND VOTE SET	The United Automobile Workers and the Chrysler Corporation reached a tentative contract early this morning that erases most of the concessions the union granted in Chrysler's financial crisis of 1979-82. If members approve the contract in voting over the weekend, the week-old strike by 70,000 workers could end Monday. The agreement, which came after a 42-hour bargaining session at Chrysler headquarters here, provides for immediate bonuses of over $2,000 for each active Chrysler worker and $1,000 for each retired worker, as well as pay and benefit increases to match workers at General Motors and Ford. $1 Billion in Labor Costs The raise in the first year is to be 2.25 percent. In the second year workers will not get an increase in base pay but will get 2.25 percent paid in a lump sum. In the third year, the raise will be 3 percent.
10/17/1985	BOTH SIDES OPTIMISTIC ON SOLUTION	More than 80,000 Chrysler workers in the United States and Canada went on strike today, seeking wages and benefits parallel to those at General Motors and Ford. Union talks with the Chrysler Corporation, the nation's third-largest automaker failed to produce agreement before the contract expired at midnight. Negotiations continued today despite the strike and leaders on both sides of the bargaining table expressed hope for an early settlement. But when negotiations broke off for the night about 8:30, union officials said there was no agreement in sight. The dispute idled more than 70,000 workers in this country and 10,000 in Canada. The union leaders said that committees dealing with some issues would continue discussions tonight and that talks by the entire union and management bargaining teams would resume in the morning.
10/15/1985	Fiat Still Invites Discussions on an Auto Merger	Despite the breakdown of its talks with the Ford Motor Company, Fiat S.p.A. remains interested in finding a merger partner for its automobile operations, Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of the Italian conglomerate, said today. ''There are five producers with 11 to 13 percent of the market in Europe,'' he said, and Fiat is one of them, with a 12 percent share last year. ''The first two to combine to get 25 percent of the market will have a very important advantage,'' he added. Mr. Agnelli was here to speak to the Economic Club of Detroit.
10/14/1985	FINANCIAL EXECUTIVE PROMOTED AT FORD	Allan D. Gilmour has been named an executive vice president of the Ford Motor Company, succeeding Will M. Caldwell, who has announced that he will retire at the end of this year. Mr. Gilmour, a career financial executive, had been vice president for employee and external affairs.
10/11/1985	FORD TO PURCHASE SPERRY FARM UNIT	While Henry Ford, the founder of the Ford Motor Company, was still alive, he made sure that his company kept ''one foot in industry and the other in the soil.'' Today, true to tradition, Ford Motor planted its foot deeper into the soil by acquiring the New Holland farm equipment operation from the Sperry Corporation. Ford said it would pay $330 million in cash for the division, and assume $110 million in liabilities, a total price that analysts said was about 50 percent of the book value of the division. New Holland produces haying and harvesting equipment, including combines. The business will be joined with that of Ford Tractor, a maker of small and medium-size tractors.
10/10/1985	Ford, AMC to Cut Some Loan Rates	The Ford Motor Company and the American Motors Corporation said today that they would offer financing at below-market rates on some vehicles, in response to a similar plan announced earlier this week by the General Motors Corporation. All three companies are offering to finance some vehicles at 8.8 percent; most lending institutions have interest rates of 10 percent to 14 percent on auto loans.
10/9/1985	Ford and Fiat Call Off Merger	The Ford Motor Company and Fiat S.p.A., the giant Italian auto maker, said today that they could not reach an agreement on a merger or a joint venture to build cars. However, the companies will continue to discuss other business arrangements such as joint production of parts, Ford said.
10/2/1985	E.D.S.'s Key Executive In Detroit Will Join Ford	Kenneth G. Riedlinger, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation's top official in Detroit, is leaving the General Motors Corporation subsidiary for the Ford Motor Company. Effective Oct. 7, Mr. Reidlinger will be executive director of special systems projects for Ford.
10/1/1985	Ford Will Offer Options Discount	The Ford Motor Company, which raised its car prices 2.9 percent for 1986, said that it would offer some discounts on optional equipment to lure buyers.
9/26/1985	Technology;   A Windshield Clears Ice Fast	SCRAPING ice from automobile windshields on winter mornings is one of the less pleasant chores that drivers face. Few, however, have the time or patience to wait the 15 minutes or so for the engine's cooling system to warm up enough for the defroster-blower to do the job. Starting next year, the Ford Motor Company will offer an optional windshield that can clear away heavy frost even in zero-degree weather in a few minutes. The company said it had developed the product in response to consumer research that showed people would be eager to have a fast-clearing windshield.
9/23/1985	Striking Workers Ratify Agreement at Ford Plant	United Auto Workers members at Ford Motor Company's Lorain Assembly Plant voted today to ratify an agreement to end their two-week strike over health, safety and production grievances. The agreement, covering some 5,200 workers, provides for the recall of 45 workers who are laid off or have been out of work because of other grievances, said Michael Pohorence, president of Local 425.
9/16/1985	G.M. CAR BUILT IN JAPAN WINS E.P.A. TEST ON FUEL MILEAGE	A model of the Chevrolet Sprint won the Government's top fuel mileage rating for 1986 cars and was the first car to score 60 miles a gallon on the highway, the Environmental Protection Agency said today. The Sprint ER, a Japanese-built minicar that replaced the Honda Civic Coupe HF at the top spot it held for the last two years, gets 55 miles a gallon in city driving, according to annual test results released by the agency. The Civic HF last year was rated at 49 miles a gallon in the city, 54 miles a gallon on the highway. This year, the best Civic HF got ratings of 52 miles a gallon in the city and 57 on the highway.
9/13/1985	Job Security Sought By U.A.W. at Chrysler	The United Automobile Workers will seek job security provisions from the Chrysler Corporation similar to those the union obtained from the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, union leaders say.
9/9/1985	5,200 Workers Strike At a Ford Plant in Ohio	Some 5,200 employees of the Ford Motor Company assembly plant here went on strike this morning, protesting unsettled health and safety grievances. ''We are on strike; that's all I can tell you,'' said Don Gullett, a benefits representative for United Automobile Workers Local 425, shortly after the midnight strike deadline. Two bargaining sessions Saturday failed to produce a settlement of nine grievances filed by the union Aug. 30, said Thomas Rhodes, a Ford spokesman in Dearborn, Mich.
8/28/1985	EFFECT ON FORD EARNINGS ECPECTED TO BE MINIMAL	The cancellation of the Sergeant York antiaircraft gun project will have little impact on the earnings of the Ford Motor Company, industry analysts said today. The gun, formally known as the Division Air Defense System, was being developed by the Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation, a subsidiary that is primarily involved in defense systems, satellite communications and space mission support. A spokesman for Ford Aerospace said the decision would affect about 1,900 workers on the project, based in Newport Beach, Calif. Ford hopes to find other jobs within the subsidiary for many of the employees or to find them jobs with other companies in southern California, the spokesman said. Total employment at Ford Aerospace is about 15,000.
8/27/1985	Ford May Increase Production Abroad	The Ford Motor Company is prepared to move production of some large-car engines abroad, possibly to Mexico, should the Federal Government refuse to relax fuel-economy laws for the next three years, a top company official said today. Louis Ross, Ford executive vice president for North American car operations, said the move could eliminate several hundred jobs in the United States, possibly at the company's engine plant in Cleveland.
8/26/1985	7.7% RATE IS LURING CAR BUYERS	Ten days after the General Motors Corporation began offering special 7.7 percent financing on most of its 1985 models still in stock, G.M. dealers around the country are reporting dramatic increases in customer visits to showrooms and are anticipating similar increases in sales. Dealers for the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and the American Motors Corporation, which followed G.M. with special incentives of their own last week, are also reporting increases in showroom traffic as customers flock to check out cars before the incentives expire when new 1986 models arrive in October. But many automobile industry analysts say the incentives - Detroit's most extensive in years - will steal many sales that would likely have been made in October anyway and will not increase the domestic makers' share of the car market. And, analysts say, the special offerings may end up forcing the domestic makers to offer another round of incentives later on.
8/23/1985	FORD TO CUT WOKERS BY 10,000	The Ford Motor Company plans to reduce its white-collar work force by 20 percent, or about 10,000 workers, over the next five years, company officials announced today. While Ford would not rule out the possibility of layoffs, it said it expected most of the cutbacks to come through attrition, a retirement incentive program and a voluntary termination plan. ''We are developing a new plan, which includes provisions for early retirements and voluntary termination, and we plan to put it into a test basis soon,'' said William T. Peacock, a spokesman for Ford. Details of the plan should be available to employees by the end of the year, he said.
8/23/1985	A.M.C. Cuts Rate To 7.5 Percent	The American Motors Corporation lowered its discount car financing offer from 8.5 percent, to 7.5 percent, to compete with recent incentives offered by the Big Three auto makers.
8/20/1985	Ford, Chrysler Loan Rates Cut	The nations second-and third-largest auto manufacturers, following the General Motors Corporation, yesterday lowered their rates on loans for most of their remaining 1985 model cars and trucks. The Ford Motor Company said that it would match G.M.'s subsidized 7.7 percent rate on loans to purchase its 1985 vehicles.
8/19/1985	Ford Korean Import Is Seen	The Ford Motor Company will begin importing a South Korean-made minicar about June 1987, an industry journal reported. The three-door car, with a 90-inch wheelbase and a four-cylinder engine, is known as the Festiva and will be built by the Kia Industrial Corporation, Ward's Automotive Reports said in a report.
8/14/1985	TOUGH CANADIAN STANCE IN CHRYSLER BEGINNING	Canadian auto workers told Chrysler Canada Ltd. today that they would insist on raises to make their compensation equal to that of employees at General Motors and Ford. ''The days of concessions at Chrysler are behind us,'' Bob White, director of the Canadian Union of Automobile Workers, told a press conference. The adamancy of Mr. White could presage a serious threat to the resurgent Chrysler Corporation, which has pinned much of its future on its popular Canadian-made mini-van. The only plant that assembles the mini-van is in Windsor, Ontario.
8/6/1985	Late-July Car Sales Off 10.5%	Sales of domestically produced new cars declined 10.5 percent in the last 10 days of July, the manufacturers reported today. For the entire month, sales were down 11 percent from July 1984. In the meantime, sales of imported cars increased almost 25 percent over last year's level, capturing about 29 percent of the American market.
8/5/1985	Nationwide's Head Cites Reasons for Ford Link	A number of analysts interpreted last week's announcement that the Ford Motor Company would acquire the First Nationwide Corporation, owner of the nation's ninth-largest savings and loan company, as an attempt by the auto maker to move into businesses providing a less cyclical return. Anthony M. Frank, First Nationwide's chairman and chief executive officer, does not see it in quite the same way. ''What earthly difference would our earnings make to a company that made $2.9 billion last year?'' asked Mr. Frank, whose company reported a net income of $31.5 million last year.
8/2/1985	FORD PLANS TO ACQUIRE THRIFT UNIT	The Ford Motor Company, continuing the Big Three auto makers' trend toward diversification into financial services, announced an agreement today to acquire the First Nationwide Financial Corporation, which owns the nation's ninth-largest savings and loan association. Ford said it would pay $32 a share in cash for all of First Nationwide's stock, making a total value of $493 million. At present 81.4 percent of First Nationwide's shares are held by National Intergroup Inc., which has agreed to the transaction. Howard M. Love, the chairman of National Intergroup, said the thrift unit was being sold because it had been retaining its earnings to finance growth rther than paying dividends.
7/27/1985	FORD NET DOWN 23.1% AS SALES SLIP	The Ford Motor Company said today that net income in the second quarter fell 23.1 percent, to $699 million, or $3.75 a share, from a record $909.1 million, or $4.95 a share, in the comparable period last year. Total sales in the quarter slipped 1.3 percent, to $13.8 billion, from $14.1 billion, on factory sales of 1.45 million units this year and 1.51 million a year ago. Ford was the last of the Big Three domestic automobile manufacturers to report on the second quarter. The three - the General Motors Corporation, the Chrysler Corporation and Ford - earned a combined total of almost $2.5 billion in the second quarter, down from $3.3 billion at the same time in 1984. The American Motors Corporation said it will announce its financial results next week.
7/13/1985	Ford Expands Leasing Operation	The Ford Motor Company, in a move to expand into the area of equipment lease financing, said its Ford Motor Credit Company had formed a new equipment leasing company to engage in transactions ranging from $100,000 to $5 million.
7/6/1985	Strike Ruling Due At Argentine Ford	Officials of the Ford Motor Company today were waiting for a final decision by the Argentine Labor Minister on the legality of a 10-day-old strike by auto workers who have taken control of the company's main office and plant. Earlier this week, Hugo Barrionuevo, the Labor Minister, declared the strike illegal and asked the workers to leave. But they did not. Union leaders said Ford had agreed in May to refrain from layoffs until August, and the Labor Minister agreed to reconsider his decision.
7/4/1985	LATE-JUNE CAR SALES FELL 11.8%	Sales of new American-made automobiles, hindered by increased shipments from Japan, fell 11.8 percent in the last 10 days of June, the manufacturers reported today. For the full month, sales of domestically produced cars slipped 3.2 percent, on a daily selling rate basis. Imports jumped 17.5 percent in June, increasing their share of the domestic market to 27.1 percent, from 25 percent in May. ''These figures were not really a surprise,'' said Wendy Beale of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''We had been expecting a slowdown in the domestic sales rates, after the first quarter, because of the increase in imports.''
7/3/1985	Sperry Stock Moves Up $1	The Sperry Corporation's stock jumped $1 a share, to $53.75, in consolidated trading yesterday amid new speculation on a possible merger. In the latest version of a persistent rumor, the Ford Motor Company was reported to be interested in buying Sperry for $65 a share, or a total of more than $3.6 billion.
6/27/1985	U.S. ALTERS MILEAGE RULES, AIDING FORD AND G.M.	The Environmental Protection Agency today announced changes in its formula for measuring automobile fuel economy, an action agency officials said appeared to bring all American automobile makers into compliance with Federal law. The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company together had faced more than $200 million in fines because in recent years the average fuel consumption of all their cars has exceeded the standards set by Federal law and administered by the Department of Transportation. They have asked that the standards be rolled back, but today's change in mileage formulas appeared to mean that they would not have to pay any fines. The E.P.A. said it had recalculated fuel economy for the cars of 25 manufacturers, retroactive to 1980, using the new formula. The agency said that as a result Ford and General Motors received enough credits toward achieving the standards to bring them into compliance with the law.
6/20/1985	Ford Ratings Up	The Ford Motor Company and Ford Motor Credit Company's senior long-term debt was raised to A from A- by the Standard and Poor's Corporation, affecting about $5.5 billion of debt securities.
6/14/1985	New-Car Sales Up 15.5% in Early June	Despite a lack of manufacturers' incentive programs and a gradual softening in consumer confidence, sales of new automobiles showed surprising strength in early June. Domestic car makers said sales rose 15.5 percent in the first 10 days of the month. Sales of light trucks increased sharply, by 35.2 percent, from the same time last year. There were eight selling days in the period this year and last.
6/6/1985	G.M. TO ACQUIRE HUGHES AIRCRAFT IN $5 BILLION BID	The General Motors Corporation, in an ambitious diversification into aerospace and high technology, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Hughes Aircraft Company for more than $5 billion in cash and stock. If approved by the stockholders of both companies, the acquisition would be the biggest in history outside the oil industry. Hughes Aircraft, the nation's seventh-largest military supplier last year and the biggest maker of communications satellites, has had a reputation as a leader in advanced electronics since its origins nearly 40 years ago within the industrial empire of the late Howard R. Hughes. Diversification Effort The move is viewed as the latest in a long-term effort by Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman, to diversify into non-automotive fields and to improve G.M.'s competitive position by embracing new technology. [Page D19.] It also follows the company's $2.5 billion purchase last year of Electronic Data Systems Inc., one of the nation's leading data-processing companies and a major supplier to the military.
6/5/1985	G.M. DEAL FOR HUGHES IS REPORTED	The General Motors Corporation has bought the Hughes Aircraft Company in a secret bidding contest, insiders said last night. The exact price G.M. agreed to pay could not be determined, but other sources familiar with the deal said it involved close to $5 billion, about half in cash and the other half in securities. The only other two bidders were the Ford Motor Company and the Boeing Company, Wall Street sources said. At a $5 billion price, the deal would rival the proposed mergers of the Allied Corporation and the Signal Companies, and of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds.
6/4/1985	Ford to Recall 515,000 Cars	Ford Motor Company has agreed to recall 515,000 1982 to 1983 Escort and Mercury Lynx cars to correct rear seat belts that can twist and bind, the Government said today. A spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Roslyn Kaiser, confirmed a report of the Ford recall, first announced by the Center for Auto Safety.
5/24/1985	U.S. CAR SALES UP 18.2% IN MID-MAY	A fresh round of buying incentives lifted sales of new American-made automobiles 18.2 percent in the May 11-20 period, the manufacturers reported today. Sales of light trucks jumped 37.4 percent. The incentives - in the form of below-market-rate financing - were introduced early in the month, but began to show results in mid-May. A sales analyst for the Ford Motor Company suggested that last week's reduction in the prime interest rate, and the subsequent rally in the stock market, helped renew consumer confidence.
5/17/1985	Fee Ruling on Ford Suit	A Federal judge in New York has ordered two lawyers, Roy M. Cohn and Allan M. Pollack, to return $230,000 in fees received from a Ford Motor Company shareholder suit against Ford's former chairman, Henry Ford 2d. The lawyers received the fees in 1980.
5/16/1985	Vehicles Are Recalled By Two Auto Makers	The Ford Motor Company has recalled 135,600 vehicles for repair, including 119,000 mid-size 1981 models with a potential pollution problem, the company has announced. In addition, the General Motors Corporation said it had recalled 34,000 1985 Chevrolet Cavaliers for removal of a plastic decoration under the hood that could shake loose from its mounting and fall on hot engine parts.
5/13/1985	It Is Time to Take Another Look at the Fuel-Economy Law	To the Editor: ''Reject the Plea From Ford, G.M.'' by Senators Daniel J. Evans and John Heinz (Op-Ed, April 20) was disappointing in view of their well-earned reputations for fairness and objectivity. But, by suggesting the law affords vehicle manufacturers the alternative of paying civil penalties instead of complying with fuel-economy standards, they do a disservice to readers and to the cause of promoting understanding of the havoc wrought by the fuel-economy law.
5/9/1985	Technology;   Auto Castings: A New Process	THE origins of the ''lost wax'' process of casting metal are lost in antiquity. Archeological evidence suggests it was in use as early as 2000 B.C. in the Middle East and some of the finely detailed gold and copper figurines that survive from the period are prized museum pieces. A variation on this ancient theme, ''lost foam,'' is a hot topic in foundry circles these days. Major manufacturers such as the General Motors Corporation, John Deere & Company and the Ford Motor Company are applying it to produce the castings that are the basic building blocks of their cars, trucks and tractors. G.M. has said the process will be an important part of its Saturn project, which is to be a new G.M. small-car division, to cut auto manufacturing costs by using new technology.
5/3/1985	Ford, Korean Unit	The Ford Motor Company said that it had held discussions with a South Korean company about importing mini-cars to the United States. The talks were conducted with the Kia Industrial Company, a maker of trucks, vans and engines, Thomas Rhoades, a Ford spokesman, said. He called the discussions preliminary.
4/29/1985	U.S. COMPANIES CUT SOME SOUTH AFRICA LINKS	Publicly citing declining profitability in South Africa, some American corporations have begun to scale back - or sell off - their South African operations. But analysts and some company officers say that the increasingly militant campaign against American involvement in South Africa is also having an impact. In the last few months, Ford and Coca-Cola have reduced their visibility there by announcing that they are converting their controlling interests in South African companies into holdings of less than 50 percent. Perkin-Elmer, a high-technology company based in Connecticut, and Blue Bell, a clothing manufacturer in North Carolina, have sold their South African operations.
4/28/1985	INVESTING; WALL STREET STARTS SPURNING THE BIG 3	BIG THREE auto stocks are likely to sputter for the rest of 1985, according to many Wall Street analysts, who believe General Motors, Ford and Chrysler will lag behind the stock market over the coming year. Their reasoning: These issues have already enjoyed most of their climb for this economic cycle. And large institutional investors apparently agree - they have been dumping the auto issues throughout 1985, according to a Salomon Brothers Inc. study of the flow of institutional funds. ''We don't think these stocks can outperform the market,'' said Harvey E. Heinbach, vice president and auto analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
4/27/1985	FORD, CITING TAX RISE, SAYS PROFIT FELL 12.7%	The Ford Motor Company reported today that first-quarter earnings dropped 12.7 percent from the previous year. The company attributed the decline largely to higher taxes and increased product development costs. Ford thus followed the two other major domestic auto companies in reporting lower earnings in the first three months of the year. Ford's profit fell to $783.3 million, or $4.20 a share, from $897.2 million, or $4.90 a share.
4/26/1985	No Retreat on Fuel Economy	To the Editor: I am writing to express staunch opposition to the petition filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on March 1 (docket No. PRM: FE002-A) by General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and the Automobile Importers of America to roll back corporate average fuel economy standards from 27.5 miles a gallon to 26 miles a gallon for model year 1986 and subsequent years. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 mandated a 27.5 miles-a-gallon fuel-economy average for automobile manufacturers in the United States by 1985, and with the sole exception of the Chrysler Corporation, this legislative goal will not be met.
4/20/1985	REJECT THE PLEA FROM FORD, G. M.	After posting record profits last year, two of the three big auto makers - Ford and General Motors - are asking help from the deficit-ridden Government. The Government should reject the plea, which would set a bad precedent, deprive Federal coffers of millions of dollars and reward companies that drag their feet, giving them unfair competitive advantage. Specifically, the auto makers are asking the Government to ease its fuel-efficiency standard for automobiles. They say that gasoline prices are coming down and that consumers want bigger, less-efficient cars. What they do not tell you is that easing the standard could save them approximately $500 million in fines for not reaching the required fuel-efficiency level. And that in turn is revenue that could be used by the Government to fund important social programs.
4/13/1985	BIG BONUSES AT THE BIG 3 AGAIN	Top executives of the Big Three auto makers have collected big bonuses again this year for a 1984 in which the companies reported record earnings totaling almost $10 billion. The total pay levels for 1984 were larger than those for 1983, which had brought the auto industry a barrage of criticism from Washington, labor circles and the general public as well. Once again, Roger B. Smith, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, was paid the most in salary and various bonuses, a combination that brought him $2,342,000 for 1984. In 1983, he received $1,491,000. The 1984 increase mostly reflected a deferred bonus plan that averaged $250,000 a year for 1982 through 1984 but was paid this year.
4/7/1985	Ford Recalls 23,000 Autos	The Ford Motor Company recalled more than 23,000 automobiles Thursday, most because of a possible electronic problem that could cause parked cars to catch fire, the company said. The company recalled 19,628 1985 Continental and Mark VII cars for possible replacement of the electronic control modules of their air suspension systems. It also recalled 3,683 1985 Thunderbirds and Cougars that might require replacement of the brake master cylinders.
4/4/1985	LATE MARCH CAR SALES ROSE 6.9%	Sales of new domestically made cars rose moderately throughout March, gaining 6.9 percent in the last 10 days of the month from the 1984 period, the major manufacturers said today. ''This was pretty much in line with what we're looking for,'' said Jean- Claude Gruet, a securities analyst who covers the auto industry for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''The 10 days came in a little lower than the numbers we've seen in the last 8 to 10 weeks, but it is still in the expected range.'' In the period, which had 9 selling days this year and 10 last year, the companies sold a total of 301,496 cars, or 33,500 a day. For all of March, sales rose 5.6 percent, to 768,927 units, bringing the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate to 8.4 million.
3/31/1985	ABOUT WESTCHESTER; LISTENING DEVICE	JACKIE GROGAN was wearing something that looked a bit like a harem outfit, but she insisted that it was not in honor of the belly dancer. No way, said Miss Grogan, who works in the billing department at Scarsdale Ford. The black and white dress was part of her regular work wardrobe, she said - and besides, what was all this belly dancer business, anyway? But sure enough, at noon sharp, there was Maia, scantily clad in blue silk and sequins, undulating her torso to some recorded music of the Middle East. As if that were not enough, there was also a clown clutching a bunch of balloons, and a delivery man bearing flowers, a four-foot-long hero sandwich and a case of Grizzly Beer. ''I had no idea she was coming, but I know the guys from down in service and parts love it,'' Miss Grogan said, and the guys heartily agreed. ''You ladies would like it better if it was a male stripper,'' one of them suggested. ''He'd have to run for his life.''
3/14/1985	14 CORPORATIONS SUED BY THE CITY ON TOXIC WASTE	The city said yesterday that it had sued 14 major corporations, seeking compensation for the cost of cleaning up five municipal landfills that it says were polluted by the companies' toxic wastes. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, also cites a carting company, contending that it disposed of the industrial and chemical wastes illegally and knowingly. The city does not charge that the 14 companies knew about the illegal dumping. But it contends that under the Federal Superfund Act the companies are liable for damages and clean- up costs.
3/14/1985	Car Sales Rose by 3.3% In Early March Period	Sales of new American-made automobiles increased 3.3 percent in the March 1-10 period from last year, the manufacturers reported today. Several of the auto makers offered financial incentives to customers during the period. The six companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen and American Honda - sold a total of 193,896 new cars in the period, which had eight selling days this year and nine in 1984. The industrywide daily selling rate of 24,237 units was the highest for the early March period since 1981, when the companies were offering cash rebates to buyers.
3/12/1985	FORD WILL SPEND $117 MILLION TO IMPROVE PARTS PLANT NEAR BUFFALO	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it was investing a record total of $117 million in improvements to its stamping plant near here, partly to retool to produce parts for a new line of mid- sized cars. Company officials said the investment, the largest in the 35-year history of the plant, would keep employment at the current level of 3,400 people. The plant is in the southern suburb of Hamburg.
3/3/1985	THE ENVIRONMENT	IT WAS the state's Department of Environmental Protection that had a better idea when the Ford Motor Company announced last year that it would sell its sprawling and seriously contaminated manufacturing plant along Route 17 in Mahwah, in northern Bergen County. Under a controversial state statute, the D.E.P. made the sale contingent upon Ford's cleaning up the hazardous wastes left on the site. The company also had to agree to decontaminate the polluted groundwater there for the next three years. The work is scheduled to begin soon and continue for just under a year. It is expected to cost more than $3 million.
3/2/1985	U.S. WILL NOT ASK JAPAN TO EXTEND CAR EXPORT CURBS	President Reagan, on the unanimous advice of his Cabinet, cleared the way today for Japan to ship more cars to the United States. The move came after nearly four years of export curbs designed to protect the American auto industry. The President, citing the ''wisdom of maintaining free and fair trade for the benefit of the world's consumers,'' said that he had decided not to ask Tokyo to extend the export quotas, which expire on March 31. In a statement released by the White House, Mr. Reagan urged Japan to reciprocate by opening its markets to American goods and pledged to ''continue to actively support further liberalization of the global trading system.''
2/23/1985	Ford Lifts Prices on Some Cars	The Ford Motor Company said today that it was raising the price of many of its large cars, and of some optional equipment, by an average 1.7 percent. That represents an average increase of $200 across the Ford line. At the same time, Ford said, it will offer cut-rate financing on its Tempo and Topaz compacts, through April 22.
2/18/1985	Union Critical Of Ford Shift DETROIT, Feb. 17 (AP) -	The United Automobile Workers union on Friday criticized the Ford Motor Company's move to ship tractor business overseas as a violation of its 1984 labor agreement. Ford announced on Thursday that it would move a large portion of its American tractor operations to Britain and Belgium, displacing 230 workers.
2/14/1985	Auto Sales Up 2.3% in Early February	Despite extremely cold weather over much of the nation, new-car sales for the six major domestic producers increased 2.3 percent in the first 10 days of February compared with the corresponding period in 1984, the companies reported today. The increase is on the basis of average daily sales, with eight selling days in this year's period and nine last year. The companies sold 165,221 new cars in the Feb. 1-10 period, or 20,653 a day. That compares with 181,694, or 20,188 daily, last year.
2/14/1985	;84 A RECORD	The Ford Motor Company today announced a 7.7 percent drop in profits, to $721 million, or $3.89 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1984, from $781 million, or $4.29 a share, a year earlier. However, sales for the quarter rose 8.1 percent, to $13.4 billion, from $12.4 billion in the final period of 1983. Auto industry analysts said that Ford gained sales because of strikes against the General Motors Corporation in the United States and Canada this summer, but a five-week walkout at Ford's European subsidiary cut into the No. 2 auto maker's profits. For the full year, though, Ford posted record earnings of $2.91 billion, or $15.79 a share, up 55.6 percent from $1.87 billion, or $10.29 a share, in 1983, the previous record year. Ford's sales for the year were $52.37 billion, up 17.8 percent from $44.46 billion.
2/8/1985	Ford Car to Have Four-Wheel Drive	The Ford Motor Company plans to introduce a four-wheel-drive version of its Mercury Topaz subcompact in about a year, officials of the company said today. And they said other models with four-wheel drive might follow.
2/6/1985	JAN. 21-31 CAR SALES OFF 4.1%	Sales of new American-made automobiles slipped 4.1 percent on a daily rate basis in late January from an extremely strong period last year, the six major auto makers reported today. The daily selling rate for the Jan. 21-31 period was 26,850, compared with 28,002 in 1984. For all of January, sales were up 3.5 percent. The daily sales rate of 24,155 was the best for the month since 1979. The rate in January 1984 was 23,337. In all, 628,037 cars were sold, compared with 583,429 in January 1984.
2/3/1985	Introducing Ford's New Merkur	Dear Sir/Madam, Please let me compliment you on your car. If it's not too much trouble, please call me. I'd like to know more about the car. Happy New Year. Alex. THE note was tucked under the windshield wiper, scribbled on the back of a toll-bridge receipt. At first glance, it looked like a parking ticket, and I was well into mutter mode before the words made me smile.
1/31/1985	A Ford Merger In South Africa	The Ford Motor Company said that it agreed in principle to merge its South African operations with the Anglo American Corporation, the South African conglomerate, with Ford becoming the minority owner of a new company called the South African Motor Corporation. Both companies said the timetable for the merger had not been worked out.
1/30/1985	FORD HEAD IN WARNING ON IMPORTS	A removal of import quotas on Japanese automobiles would sharply worsen the trade gap between Japan and the United States, the Ford Motor Company's incoming chairman, Donald E. Petersen, said today. Mr. Petersen said he met last month in Washington with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Bill Brock, the President's special trade representative, to argue for an extension of the import restrictions.
1/24/1985	JAN. 11-20 CAR SALES ROSE 4.1%	New-car sales by the nation's six major manufacturers rose 4.1 percent in the Jan. 11-20 selling period, the companies reported today. The average daily rate of sales was the highest for the period since 1973. The companies sold 168,668 new automobiles, or 21,084 a day, up from 182,273, or 20,253 a day, last year. There were with eight selling days in the period this year and nine last year. In the 1973 period, there were 23,390 cars sold a day.
1/22/1985	Ford Appears No. 1 in Europe	The Ford Motor Company said that it appears to have won the ar sales race in Europe for the first time in its history.
1/16/1985	Early-January Auto Sales Rose 12%	Opening the new year with higher-than-expected sales, American auto makers reported today that new-car sales in the Jan. 1-10 period rose 12 percent, on a daily selling rate basis. The annual selling rate, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, was 8.9 million units, up from a rate of 8 million in the last 10 days of December and from a strong 8.2 million in the period a year ago. The daily selling rate for the early- January period of 23,859 was the highest since 1966, when the domestic companies sold cars at a daily rate of 28,922. Industry analysts had expected sales to be flat or down slightly from last year's robust level. Some cautioned that the better-than-expected sales were the result of slow sales in December because of cold weather and the holidays.
1/5/1985	THE AUTO INDUSTRY'S BIG YEAR	American consumers bought a total of 14.1 million cars and light trucks in 1984, giving the automobile industry its best sales year since 1979. Although total sales fell below the peaks set in the mid-1970's, the robust year should produce record- setting profits for the Big Three auto makers, which are expected to report combined earnings of about $10 billion. That sum would easily surpass the previous record of $6.15 billion set last year and is well above the $4.5 billion earned in 1978, when total car and truck sales reached 15 million. Even allowing for inflation, $10 billion in profits for last year would be appreciably lusher than the 1978 earnings.
1/4/1985	Dec. 11-20 Auto Sales Fell 3% Shortage of Inventory Seen	Sales of new cars by the nation's six major auto manufacturers fell a slight 3 percent in the Dec. 11-20 period, the companies reported today. Industry analysts noted that while sales were down slightly, the comparable 1983 period was exceptionally strong and that some car lines were in short supply this year. ''Sales were not so much a reflection of demand, but an inventory-induced aberration,'' said Ted Sullivan, an economist with Data Resources Inc. The companies reported a daily sales rate of 21,801 in the mid-December period, down from the 22,469 daily rate in the comparable 1983 period. There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight last year.
1/4/1985	Ford Won't	- The Ford Motor Company said that it would not raise its car prices in response to the latest price increase by the industry leader, the General Motors Corporation. A statement issued by Philip Benton, Ford's vice president for North American operations,
1/3/1985	CONVERSING WITH YOUR CAR	THE talking car has been around for five years now - ever since Nissan's Maxima started jabbering about doors ajar, low fuel and lights left on. Today, though, a more complex technology is on the horizon and it centers on an automobile that listens as well as talks. Like Michael Knight on the television show ''Knight Rider,'' drivers of the late 1980's and early 1990's will converse with what now would be considered super vehicles, according to experts in the fledgling field. And the idea is not as silly as it might seem, they say, because voice command will promote safety by allowing a driver to keep eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. Current prototypes perform only simple functions, such as starting the engine and turning on the lights and windshield wipers. But the end product is expected to be a car that can be told to tune its radio, alter its interior climate and dial its cellular telephone, as well as respond to questions about engine condition, fuel economy and the driver's trip in general.
12/19/1984	Ford Names New Head Of Diversified Products	The Ford Motor Company today promoted its top car salesman to head its nonautomotive activities. Philip E. Benton Jr. was elected executive vice president in charge of Ford Diversified Products Operations, effective Feb. 1, replacing Thomas C. Page, who is retiring after 32 years with the company.
12/14/1984	Dec. 1-10 Car Sales Rebound by 19.9%	Sales of new cars bounced back in the first 10 days of December with the nation's six major manufacturers today reporting sales of 184,470 units, up 19.9 percent from the period last year, on a daily rate basis. The annual selling rate for cars, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, rose to 9 million units, from an unusually low 6.4 million rate at the end of November. Automotive analysts, who often caution that one 10-day sales report does not indicate a trend, said the 30-day running average of about 7.8 million units was back to more normal levels. ''The erratic sales pattern of the past 40 days will have to show some stability for the next 20 days before anyone can really say where the market is going,'' said L.R. Windecker, an analyst for the Ford Motor Company. ''But the trend of the past 30 days is better than we saw through September and October.''
12/5/1984	NOV. 21-30 CAR SALES OFF 14.2%	New-car sales by the nation's major auto makers fell 14.2 percent in the last 10 days of November, surprising industry executives and analysts who were expecting the trend to continue upward from mid-November. Sales have been restrained recently by inventory shortages created by strikes at the General Motors Corporation and by a shortage of parts. Throughout November the companies produced cars at record levels and sales surged in the middle of the month, slightly above projections. But the companies reported today that, in the selling period that ended Nov. 30, deliveries totaled 186,721, down from 217,540 last year. That brought the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate to 6.4 million, down from 7.9 million for mid-November and 7.3 million for the end-of-November period in 1983.
12/4/1984	Carburetor Problems Lead Ford to Recall 91,000 Cars	The Ford Motor Company today recalled 91,000 cars and trucks for a problem with four-barrel carburetors that could cause the engines to accelerate uncontrollably, the company said.
12/1/1984	FOR MAZDA, A U.S. CAR PLANT	Detroit's hard- pressed auto workers, after years of chafing under Japanese competition, suddenly face a prospect of being employed by Japanese auto makers. The Mazda Motor Corporation announced today that it would build a $450 million automobile assembly plant in Flat Rock, Mich., on the site of an old Ford Motor Company cast- iron plant. The plant is expected to employ 3,500 people, many of whom would be members of the United Automobile Workers, company officials said. Construction of the new plant will begin in 1985, with the first cars to be produced by 1987, the officials said. Eventually, Mazda plans to produce 240,000 cars a year there.
11/28/1984	NOV. 11-20 AUTO SALES IMPROVED SHARP 28.8%	Automobile sales improved sharply in the Nov. 11- 20 period, the manufacturers reported here today. Sales by the six major companies jumped 28.8 percent in mid- November from the period last year. Industry analysts said the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 7.9 million was near normal, following a strike-induced slump that brought the rate down to 6.9 million early this month and the same level for all of October.
11/27/1984	TOP THREE AMERICAN AUTOMAKERS RECALL 4 MILLION VEHICLES	The nation's three largest automobile manufacturers today announced they were recalling more than four million automobiles to inspect and repair potential safety defects. The Department of Transportation announced that the General Motors Corporation had agreed to call back 3.1 million of its mid-size passenger cars from the 1978 to 1980 model years for ''inspection'' and repairs ''where needed'' of rear axles. Wear in the axle compartments had been found, in some cases, to cause separation of the axle shaft and wheel assembly from the rest of the vehicle. The callback was the largest such action of its kind since the 1973 recall of 3.7 million General Motors vehicles for correction of steering lock defects.
11/25/1984	SHARP TAKING PART OF FORD PLANT SITE	When the Ford Motor Company locked the gates of its Mahwah, N.J., assembly plant four years ago, throwing 3,350 people out of work, the strength of Japanese car imports, no doubt, had a hand in turning the key. Now a Japanese electronics company will build its American headquarters on a large chunk of the huge 172-acre facility Ford had there.
11/15/1984	Nov. 1-10 Car Sales Fell by 4.7 Percent	Sales of new cars by the nation's six major auto manufacturers slipped 4.7 percent in the first 10 days of November, the companies reported here today. Sales by the six companies totaled 188,775 in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last, down from 198,126 in 1983. The decline was attributed to supply problems at the General Motors Corporation because of strikes against G.M. in September and October and to a shortage of parts needed for the 1985 models by G.M. supplier companies.
11/12/1984	Ford Workers in Canada Vote to Accept Contract	About 14,200 workers at Ford Motor Company of Canada voted overwhelmingly today to ratify a three-year contract, heading off a general strike against the company's nine Ontario plants, union spokesmen said.
11/11/1984	THE T-BIRD IS 30 YEARS OLD	THE card says, ''Happy 'Bird Day,'' and it comes from Ford to announce that, as of tomorrow, exactly 30 years have passed since the first customer drove away in a car bearing the Thunderbird flag. The new and aerodynamic design of today is nearly as radical, if not quite as classic, as the little two-seater that started it all. Now the Bird comes in Elan, Fila and Turbo Coupe, and the personalities vary to suit buyers. In addition, today's car is a well-developed package of high technology - smooth, quick, loaded with electronics and relatively economical.
11/9/1984	Ford Approves Special Payout DETROIT, Nov. 8 (AP) -	The Ford Motor Company today issued a one-time, special 50-cent-a-share dividend on common stock, and authorized the purchase of 10 million of its common shares. The special dividend is payable Jan. 3 to shareholders of record Nov. 30.
11/8/1984	Ford Makes Offer to Workers Threatening Strike in Canada	The Ford Motor Company made an offer to its Canadian workers today in the face of a strike deadline of noon Friday.
11/6/1984	OCT.21-31 CAR SALES INCREASED 3.3%	Sales of new American-made automobiles rose 3.3 percent in the Oct. 21-31 period from the comparable period a year before, despite strikes against the General Motors Corporation's Canadian plants that held down G.M. sales. The daily combined selling rate of 27,184 reported by the six domestic auto companies today was the highest in the late October period since 1979. Total sales for the period were 244,659, compared with 236,895 in 1983. There were nine selling days in each period.
11/5/1984	Index Draws Dissent	Matters of a few tenths of a percentage point have a great bearing on how the Government and private economists see the economy evolving, particularly on the eves of national elections. Take, for example, the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators. It is used to forecast the onset of recessions and recoveries.
11/4/1984	AUTO CONTRACTS IN BITS AND PIECES	The United Auto Workers set another strike deadline last week, but much of the suspense seemed to have gone out the union's fall offensive. The latest targets were the Canadian facilities of Ford Motor Company.
11/2/1984	MOODY'S REVIEWS CAR MAKER RATING	Debt ratings for the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are being reviewed for possible upgrading, analysts at Moody's Investors Service announced yesterday.
11/1/1984	BOOM IN LUXURY CAR IMPORTS	For almost two decades, European car makers have nibbled away at the highly profitable American luxury car market with hardly any response from the Big Three. Stressing high performance and engineering advances, the Europeans are fielding such makes as the Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Audi, BMW and Saab to do battle with Detroit's traditional view of the luxury car: a big, lushly appointed highway cruiser with a large engine, like the Cadillac and Lincoln. In recent years, the Japanese joined the fray, exporting the Toyota Cressida and Nissan Maxima, among others. The imports are increasing their market share at a time when luxury models of all kinds, including the traditional makes, have become more popular, accounting for about 10 percent of total sales this year. Some American auto executives now concede that they were as unprepared to meet the Europeans at the top of the market as they were to take on the Japanese several years ago at the lower end. ''We didn't recognize as early as some other parts of the world that the market for luxury vehicles was changing in terms of what it wanted in addition to the traditional elements of comfort, image and prestige,'' said John O. Grettenberger, the general manager of Cadillac.
10/30/1984	CALDWELL TO RETIRE AT FORD	Philip Caldwell, the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, announced today that he would retire next year and that his successor would be Donald E. Petersen, the company's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Caldwell said he would step down as head of the nation's second- largest car maker on Feb. 1, four days after his 65th birthday. Ford has never had a mandatory retirement policy. Henry Ford - who founded the company, invented the Model T and pioneered the modern assembly line - was in his 80's when members of the Ford family forced him to retire during World War II.
10/30/1984	NEW LEADER IN DETROIT WHO FOCUSES ON DESIGN	Donald E. Petersen vividly remembers the day in 1949 when he and a slightly senior executive of the Ford Motor Company met with the company's chief engineer to suggest that the product planning department they were establishing should get involved in designing future car models. ''Well, after I picked myself up off the curb and brushed myself off, I told my boss that we had some convincing to do,'' he said, recalling the incident. ''At that time most of the engineers were master mechanics up from the shop floor,'' he went on. ''They decided what was needed for the next year, did it, and told the sales department, 'this is the new model.' ''
10/27/1984	FORD'S NET UP 14% IN 3D QUARTER	The Ford Motor Company today reported third- quarter earnings of $379.7 million, or $2.05 a share, a 14 percent increase over the $333.1 million, or $1.83 a share, earned in the 1983 quarter. The report by the No. 2 American auto maker was generally in line with analysts' expectations, although some of them had recently revised their estimates downward as a result of lost production due to new-model change-over and quality problems with purchased components. The American Motors Corporation also reported earnings today, with a profit of $2.5 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $9 million in the previous year's period. Two two reports bring the combined earnings of the four United States-based auto companies to $1.06 billion for the period , well below the more than $3 billion in combined earnings reported in each of the first two quarters. The third quarter is traditionally the weakest for the auto makers, as they suffer production losses during vacations and new model changeovers, and have the extra expenses of introducing new model lines.
10/25/1984	Auto Sales Fall 6.5%; G.M. Strikes Blamed	Sales of new American-made automobiles, held down by strikes at the nation's largest car maker, fell 6.5 percent in the Oct. 11-20 period, according to figures released today by the nation's six major automobile manufacturers. Selected General Motors Corporation assembly plants in the United States were shut down for six days late last month by the United Automobile Workers when negotiators failed to reach an agreement on a new labor contract. And workers in Canada walked off the job Oct. 17, when talks stalled on a new labor contract there. Many American assembly plants are dependent on components produced only in Canada, and G.M. began closing those plants late last week.
10/23/1984	Ford Recalls Small Trucks	The Ford Motor Company today recalled nearly half a million 1983 and 1984 Ranger minipickup trucks for free replacement or repair of secondary hood latches, fuel cap tethers and fuel hoses and clamps.
10/16/1984	OCT. 1-10 CAR SALES ROSE 4.1%	New-car sales in the Oct. 1-10 period rose 4.1 percent, on a sales-per-day basis, compared with the same period last year, the nation's six major manufacturers reported today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate, however, fell to 6.6 million units, from 6.7 million in the last 10 days of September and 7.9 million for the month as a whole, but analysts played down the significance of the decline, citing a distortion in the factors used to compute the rate. ''It used to be that because of the way new cars were introduced in the fall, with much anticipation and hoopla, sales were very strong in the last part of the year and the seasonal adjustment factors took that into effect,'' Ann Knight, an auto analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said. ''Certainly between now and the end of the year the seasonal adjustment factors will tend to penalize sales for the old- fashioned new model introduction, which no longer takes place.''
10/15/1984	G.M. ACCORD IS SET	Negotiators for the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers reached agreement on a new labor contract this morning. Also today, union officials said a pact with the General Motors Corporation had been ratified by 57 percent of the rank and file. The tentative agreement with Ford came after a continuous 24-hour bargaining session. It was reached almost two days after an informal deadline set for noon Friday and closely parallels the accord reached last month at General Motors, officials of both sides said.
10/13/1984	FORD TALKS GO ON PAST A DEADLINE	An informal deadline for a settlement in the negotiations between the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers passed at noon today with both sides still at the bargaining table. ''We are making progress in our talks,'' said Stephen P. Yokich, the head of the union's Ford department. ''But there are many issues still to be resolved in several major areas, including job security and economics. We will continue to bargain with the aim of reaching a tentative agreement as quickly as possible.''
10/4/1984	SEPT. 21-30 CAR SALES OFF 7.8%	Sales of new American-made autos fell 7.8 percent in the last 10 days of September, compared with the daily rate from the same period a year ago, auto makers reported today. Sales for the entire month, however, were up from those of a year ago. The decrease for the last period in September, only the second decline this year, was attributed to strikes by the United Automobile Workers union at some General Motors plants, which decreased car supplies as a new labor contract was being negotiated. The six-day strikes ended Sept. 21.
10/4/1984	Auto Workers and Ford Discuss Labor Contract	Bargainers for the United Automobile Workers and the Ford Motor Company held meetings today on individual contract issues in a new pact for 114,000 hourly workers. No formal main table session was scheduled, but a Ford spokesman, Tony Fredo, said four subcommittees met to negotiate various areas of the contract.
10/3/1984	IACOCCA EXPOSES SCARS OF FORD ERA	Although Lee A. Iacocca has become a folk hero in this capital of the auto industry, he bears the scars of old wounds and is not above settling old scores. In this week's Newsweek magazine, Mr. Iacocca, now chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, makes it clear that bitterness surrounding his dismissal as president of the Ford Motor Company in 1979 has not abated, nor have his feelings toward Henry Ford 2d, the man who discharged him, grown any warmer. All this comes as no shock to the gossipy, closely knit auto fraternity, but Mr. Iacocca's version of his relationship with Mr. Ford is remarkable for its open rancor. Mr. Iacocca's rendering of his life in the automobile business deletes few expletives and misses few chances to disparage Mr. Ford - ''a king who could tolerate no equals,'' in the Chrysler chairman's words.
9/23/1984	HONDA CIVIC COUPE IS RATED BEST IN U.S. TEST FOR MILEAGE	A Honda model, for the second straight year, captured the best mileage ranking among automobiles sold in the United States, according to the annual ratings released today by the Environmental Protection Agency. Foreign-made engines, six of them diesels, powered all the 10 top mileage- yielding 1985 autos that will go on sale this fall. The two-seater Honda Civic Coupe HF recorded 49 miles per gallon in the environmental agency's city driving test and 54 m.p.g. in the highway test.
9/22/1984	GENERAL MOTORS AND UNION REACH TENTATIVE ACCORD	The United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation reached agreement early today on a tentative three-year contract providing wage increases, added pension benefits and job security. In another major settlement that includes new provisions to protect the jobs of workers threatened by layoffs, the United Mine Workers and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association agreed today on a 40-month contract. (Page 10.) The General Motors settlement, at the end of a 16-hour bargaining session, came six days after the union began selective strikes that shut down over half of the manufacturer's car and truck production, idling about 110,000 workers. The pact covers 350,000 workers.
9/22/1984	Ford Fills Key Job in Europe	The Ford Motor Company today named Alexander J. Trotman president of its European operations. Mr. Trotman has been president of Ford's Asia-Pacific operations. The European position has been open since May, when James Capolongo resigned in an apparent dispute with officials at Ford headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
9/19/1984	Ford Shuts Line	The Ford Motor Company temporarily laid off the 2,500 employees on its passenger car assembly line at its plant here, said a Ford spokesman, Robert Pollock, because of a shortage of good quality parts from an outside supplier. The line makes Tempo and Mercury Topaz models.
9/18/1984	Ford Sets 85 Price Rise of 1.3%	The Ford Motor Company today said that it would increase the retail price of its 1985 model cars by an average of $153, or 1.3 percent, somewhat less than the tentative prices announced earlier. Ford had told its dealers early this month that prices might increase an average of as much as 1.9 percent, or $225. With the company's approval, Ford dealers have been selling 1985 cars on the basis of the tentative prices, even though the cars were not officially to go on sale until early October.
9/14/1984	Sept. 1-10 Sales of New Cars Up 29.7%	The major American automobile manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars in the first 10 days of September rose 29.7 percent from the same period last year, on a daily rate basis. The average daily selling rate of 21,463 was the highest since 1979. The rate last year was 16,542, when sales were restrained by low inventory.
9/9/1984	NEGLIGENCE AWARD IS REDUCED	A state district judge has reduced a jury's punitive damage award by $80 million in a negligence case against the Ford Motor Company. David Perry, attorney for the couple who filed the civil suit against Ford, said Friday that the revised judgment, $26.8 million, was still the ''largest exemplary damage amount ever assessed against Ford.''
9/6/1984	AUG. 21-31 CAR SALES UP 11.6%	New-car sales rose 11.6 percent, on a daily selling rate basis, in the Aug. 21-31 period, the six major American manufacturers reported here today. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said dealers delivered a total of 237,078 new cars, bringing the seasonally adjusted annual rate to 7.8 million units. However, the adjusted rate for the entire month of August was 7.7 million units - down from 8.4 million in July and the lowest for any month this year, although much improved from August 1983, when it was 6.6 million. Industry analysts said the August decline, while slightly greater than some estimates, was expected because car sales have been higher than normal for several months. They said low inventory levels and spot shortages of the best-selling cars slowed August sales.
9/5/1984	Ford Plans 1.9% Rise in 85 Prices	The Ford Motor Company advised its dealers today that it was tentatively increasing the price of its 1985 model cars by 1.9 percent, or an average of $225 a car. Ford was the last of the domestic auto companies to indicate prices on the 1985 models, most of which will go on sale shortly after Oct. 1. A spokesman for the company said final prices will probably be released within 10 days.
8/30/1984	UNION PICKS TWO AUTO MAKERS AS STRIKE TARGETS	The United Automobile Workers today chose both Ford and General Motors as strike targets in the current negotiations for a new labor contract. However, Owen F. Bieber, the union president, was given the authority to designate one of the two companies as a strike target as the talks moved closer to Sept. 15, the expiration of the current contract. The decision by the union's leadership represents a departure from past practice. In most cases, only one of the auto companies has been chosen the focus of negotiations, to increase the pressure on it to grant the union's demands.
8/29/1984	G.M. AND FORD MAKE OFFERS BUT THE UNION SPURNS THEM	General Motors and Ford made their first offers today in contract talks with the United Automobile Workers. Both were quickly denounced as ''meager'' and ''inadequate'' by union leaders. The two proposals, while different, emphasized profit-sharing rather than wage increases and provided few of the assurances the union was seeking to prevent job losses through overseas production or by new technology. Union officials said the wide gap between what the companies were offering and what the union had demanded earlier would make it more difficult to reach an agreement by Sept. 15, the strike deadline.
8/24/1984	U.S. CAR SALES UP 32.1% IN AUG. 10-20 PERIOD	Sales of new American-made automobiles bounced back in the second 10 days of August, with the six major manufacturers today reporting an increase of 32.1 percent, on a daily selling rate basis, from the same period last year. The daily rate of 23,651 sales was the highest since 1979. Sales were down slightly in the first 10 days of this month, as inventory levels continued to fall below desired levels. Most of the auto makers have closed some operations to change over to 1985 models. The annual rate of sales, seasonally adjusted, rose to 8.1 million domestic units, from 7.4 million in the Aug. 1-10 period, and up from a 6.6 million rate last year at this time.
8/16/1984	GENERAL MOTORS PROPOSES CHANGES IN ITS EMPLOYEE HEALTH PROGRAM	The General Motors Corporation said today that it was seeking a major revision in the way it administers the nation's largest nongovernmental program of health care benefits. It was the automobile maker's first formal proposal toward a new contract with the United Automobile Workers, whose contracts with G.M. and the Ford Motor Company expire Sept. 14. Alfred S. Warren Jr., the company's vice president for industrial relations, said that G.M. proposed to offer each employee a choice of three options: a new network of ''preferred providers'' of health care, consisting of clinics and hospitals under contract to G.M.; an expanded system of health maintenance organizations, which handle all of a subscriber's health needs for a fixed fee, or a modified version of the current medical insurance system with stricter safeguards against potential abuses. The union's reaction was conciliatory. ''I think this is a positive approach to a serious problem,'' said Donald Ephlin, a U.A.W. vice president.
8/11/1984	Ford-Mazda Plan	The Ford Motor Company has asked the Mazda Motor Corporation to supply auto parts to its small-car factory to be built in northwest Mexico, an official of the Japanese company said. Ford plans to complete the $500 million plant in Hermosillo, Sonora, in 1986, with planned production of about 130,000 units a year. Ford, which has a 24.4 percent equity stake in Mazda, has said it plans to sell cars produced at the Mexican plant in Mexico, the United States and Canada.
8/7/1984	Hang On to the Fuel Standards	Citing the slow sales of fuel-efficient vehicles, Ford and General Motors want the Government to lower its fuel-mileage standards for light trucks. If they succeed, they will almost surely ask for similar relief for autos. The companies make one sound argument. They could probably sell cars that comply with existing standards if gasoline prices had risen - or been raised by taxes - to the levels expected by Government when the standards were set.
8/4/1984	Ford and U.S. Steel Plan a Rouge Unit	The Ford Motor Company and the United States Steel Corporation announced plans today to construct and operate a $130 million galvanizing plant at Ford's Rouge works south of Detroit. The plant is scheduled to begin operating in mid-1986, in time for the auto industry's 1987 model year, Ford said, and will employ 75 people.
8/4/1984	JULY 21-31 AUTO SALES SHOW INCREASE OF 15.7%	Sales by the six major domestic automobile manufacturers rose 15.7 percent in the July 21-31 period, the best performance for the period since 1979, the car makers reported today. Analysts cited recent favorable economic factors for the sales strength. They added, however, that the pace was not likely to be sustained much longer because of diminishing inventories. ''Consumers have every reason to be out there buying cars,'' said John Hammond, an analyst with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ''Inflation's low, interest rates have stopped rising for the moment, and it looks like there's a price break in the energy market. The problem is that the manufacturers just do not have the cars.''
8/3/1984	FORD WANTS PAY BASED ON PROFITS	The Ford Motor Company proposed today to base all future wage increases for its factory workers on profits through a profit-sharing plan. It was the company's first offer in the negotiations for a new labor contract that began on July 24. Stanley J. Surma, a top Ford labor relations official, said in a presentation to the union: ''When income growth is tied to profitability, two things happen, both of which make eminent good sense. First, the employees appropriately share in the company's prosperity; and second, we are somewhat protected against incremental cost burdens when severe downturns occur.''
8/1/1984	REAGAN ASKS RESTRAINT BY UNION	President Reagan has injected himself into the automobile labor negotiations, calling on the United Automobile Workers to use ''some restraint'' in demands this summer. If the union does otherwise, Mr. Reagan said, it could endanger ''the recovery, the expansion that we're having.''
7/12/1984	AUTO MAKERS HOPING STATE LAWS SAVE THEM FROM AIR BAG RULING	The nation's three leading automobile manufacturers said today that they hoped enough states would pass seat belt legisation to allow them to avoid installing air bags in some of their 1987 model cars. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler criticized a Federal regulation requiring air bags or automatic seat belts in 10 percent of their 1987 cars, and said they would lobby legislatures to enact mandatory seat belt laws. If states with two-thirds of the nation's population do so, the air bag regulation would be dropped. The manufacturers also said they would concentrate on improving the crashworthiness of their cars with new designs and materials.
7/9/1984	AUTO MAKERS TURN TO KOREA	American auto makers are again looking to the Far East to find a nation that offers low labor costs, a well- educated and hard-working labor force and a government that encourages big business. But it is not Japan that has drawn their attention this time, but South Korea. In June, the General Motors Corporation and the Daewoo Motor Company signed a $426 million agreement to produce 167,000 cars a year in South Korea by 1987. About half those cars will be exported, with many expected to be distributed in the United States by the Pontiac Division of General Motors.
6/26/1984	U.S. CAR SALES RISE BY 12.4%	Sales of new American-made cars in the mid-June period increased 12.4 percent over last year, auto makers reported here today. The increase was based on average daily sales, which were at the highest level for the period since 1978. The six major domestic companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold a total of 259,844 new cars, or 28,872 a day, against 205,444, or 25,681 daily, in the comparable 1983 period. There were nine selling days in the June 11-20 period this year and eight last year.
6/23/1984	SHAKY FORD EUROPE GETS A NEW LEADER	The Ford Motor Company said today that it was sending its head of international operations to take direct charge of Ford of Europe, a vital source of profits that has been shaken in recent months by lagging sales and the resignations, in rapid succession, of two chairmen. The No. 2 auto maker also said that it was splitting its international operations into two groups, with Ford-Europe alone in one and Asia- Pacific and Latin American automotive operations combined in the other. The company named Robert A. Lutz, executive vice president-international operations, chairman of the European unit and L. Lindsey Halstead, a vice president of the company, to head the Asia-Pacific and Latin America group. Analysts said it appeared that Mr. Lutz was being sent to take a firm hold of the reins in Europe, which accounts for 30 percent of Ford's total automotive sales and where many of Ford's top executives, including Mr. Caldwell, have served. Mr. Lutz was chairman of the European unit from April 1979 until August 1982, when he was moved to corporate headquarters in Dearborn to oversee all international automotive operations.
6/22/1984	ART OF BRITISH HOMES TO BE EXHIBITED	More than 800 objects of art from at least 120 British stately homes will be sent to the United States next year for an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Plans for the show were announced at simultaneous press conferences today in London and Washington. The show, ''The Treasure Houses of Britain,'' will open in November 1985, under the patronage of the Prince and Princess of Wales, who may attend the inaugural ceremonies, and will run until March 1986. The Ford Motor Company is underwriting the costs with what it calls ''a very substantial grant.'' Sources in the London art world predicted that the British and American Governments would have to indemnify the art works against loss for some $250 million.
6/14/1984	EARLY JUNE AUTO SALES UP BY 0.3%	The six major American auto manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars edged up only three-tenths of 1 percent in early June from the 1983 period. The sales are figured on a daily selling rate basis. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, American Honda and Volkswagen of America - said sales totaled 187,482 units in the June 1-10 period, or 23,435 units a day, compared with 210,188 and a rate of 23,353 daily a year earlier. There were eight selling days in the 1984 period versus nine last year.
6/6/1984	CAR SALES JUMPED 19.1% IN LAST 10 DAYS OF MAY	New-car sales in the last 10 days of May rose 19.1 percent from the 1983 period on a daily selling rate basis, the major manufacturers reported here today. The daily rate of 37,582 was the highest for the period since 1978. Analysts expressed surprise at the sales figures, which were stronger than anticipated for both the end of the month and all of May. Sales in the month were also the highest since 1978.
5/31/1984	GERMAN STRIKE SLOWING EUROPEAN AUTO OUTPUT	A strike by West German metalworkers for a 35-hour workweek is gradually crippling wide sectors of Europe's auto industry, including the subsidiaries of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation. The stoppages come as Europe's auto industry is emerging from a prolonged slump, and analysts say new approaches to inventory management instituted to deal with the industry's problems have exacerbated the impact. The strikes also cast a shadow over Germany's economic recovery, which has been sparked in large measure by sales of consumer goods, including automobiles.
5/26/1984	Tax Ruling Backs Ford	A Detroit suburb and two other taxing units must return to the Ford Motor Company more than $18 million in property tax overpayments on the auto maker's Rouge plant, a Michigan Tax Tribunal judge ruled. The City of Dearborn must return $5 million in taxes collected from Ford in 1981 and 1982, plus $1 million interest, the administrative law judge, Charles P. McDonald, ordered. He ruled that Wayne County owes $3 million and the Dearborn Board of Education owes $9 million.
5/23/1984	Ford, Starnet	The Ford Motor Company said it plans to purchase a 70 percent interest in the Starnet Corporation, a long- distance telecommunications provider.
5/21/1984	AN IMAGE PROBLEM FOR DETROIT	To some people, the decision of General Motors and Ford, the two largest automobile makers, to pay record bonuses to their executives while enjoying protection from Japanese competition is a symbol of management high-handedness that may cause political problems for all of corporate America. The auto bonuses, in the two weeks since they were disclosed, have stirred a storm of protests that Detroit seems to be feathering its own nest. Executives of the auto companies acknowledge that they expected a hostile reaction to the payments, which put the compensation of top officers of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company well over $1 million each for 1983. Matching Other Industries But they say that high pay for key executives is standard in American business and that to leave auto executives' compensation below the levels of other manufacturing industries would risk seeing their most talented people go find better pay elsewhere. Allan Gilmour, Ford's vice president for external affairs, said public reaction was considered before the bonuses were paid.
5/16/1984	May 1-10 Auto Sales Jumped 25.5%	New-car sales in the first 10 days of May jumped 25.5 percent from the period a year earlier, the nation's major manufacturers reported today. The increase was on a daily rate basis, with nine selling days in the period this year and eight a year ago. The companies, G.M., Ford, Chrysler, A.M.C., Honda and VW, sold 238,240 automobiles in the May 1-10 period, or 26,471 a day. That was the highest daily rate for the period since 1979. Last year the six car makers delivered 168,785 units, or 21,098 a day.
5/11/1984	Ford Chairman Silent on Plans DETROIT, May 10 - Philip	Caldwell, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, answering queries from stockholders, today declined to provide any details on when he would step down as chairman of the world's second-largest automobile company. Mr. Caldwell, who will be 65 years old in January, told shareholders at Ford's annual meeting today that officers of the company have no employment contracts and that he serves at the pleasure of the board.
5/5/1984	HEAD OF FORD DEFENDS BONUS	DEARBORN, Mich., May 4 - Philip Caldwell, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, today defended the large bonuses paid to auto executives last year and said that if restraints on imports of Japanese cars end next year, auto makers might be forced to shift much of their manufacturing overseas. Reacting to statements by officials of the Reagan Administration, who said the bonuses indicated that the industry no longer needed protection from the Japanese, Mr. Caldwell said, ''You may think we are paid too much, but the level itself should not be a factor in any consideration of the correct policy toward Japanese restraints or in making other fundamental changes in national trade policy.''
5/4/1984	LATE-APRIL AUTO SALES ROSE 36.6%	Sales of new cars by the nation's major manufacturers rose 36.6 percent in the last 10 days of April from a year earlier, the companies reported today. The increase was measured on a daily rate basis, with eight selling days in the period this year and nine last year. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate, which has been bouncing up and down the last two months, rose to 8.3 million in the April 21-30 period, from 7.7 million in mid-April, to reach 8.1 million for the month, about what analysts had expected. Ann Knight, an auto analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, said: ''These are good strong sales. They are sustainable. When we are in a period resembling normal demand, as we are now, you're going to see some fluctuation from one 10-day period to the next. Between now and the end of the second quarter, anything between a 7.5-million and 8.5-million rate will not surprise me.''
4/27/1984	FORD POSTS RECORD NET IN QUARTER	The Ford Motor Company reported today that it earned $897.2 million, or $4.90 a share, in the first quarter of 1984, a record for the company and more than four times the $211.2 million, or $1.17 a share, in the first quarter of 1983. With the Chrysler Corporation already reporting a profit of $701 million and the General Motors Corporation expected to report Friday that it had earnings approaching $1.5 billion, the quarter should be a record for the industry as a whole, exceeding the combined $2.43 billion earned in the fourth quarter of 1983. Analysts attributed the rapid recovery of Ford and the industry - which had a combined loss of $187 million as recently as the fourth quarter of 1982 - to increased sales and a shift in consumer preference to larger, more expensive models.
4/17/1984	Ford Investment Set	The Ford Motor Company said today that it planned to invest $93 million in its Halewood plant near Liverpool, to start building a new five-speed transmission for European-built cars. The auto maker expects to produce 300,000 units a year of the new transmissions starting in 1987.
4/14/1984	EARLY APRIL AUTO SALES UP BY 33.2%	Sales of new American-made automobiles jumped 33.2 percent in the first 10 days of April, the six major manufacturers reported today. The daily selling rate of 26,299 was the highest for any early-April period since 1979. Sales in the period rose to 210,395 from 157,875 a year earlier, putting the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate at 8.3 million, up from a 6.6 million rate a year ago and 7.9 million for the past month.
4/12/1984	PRESIDENT, STRESSING ECONOMIC GAINS, WARNS OF 'SNAKE OIL CURES'	President Reagan visited a busy automobile factory today to stress the domestic economy as a campaign issue and warn against the ''snake oil cures'' of his opponents. ''They believe we should run up the flag in defense of our markets, embrace protectionism and insulate ourselves from world competition,'' Mr. Reagan declared in denouncing the trade restrictions on foreign-made products that have been advocated by Democratic rivals in the Presidential campaign. ''We'll never meet the challenges of the 80's with that kind of defeatist mentality,'' he said, recalling the protectionist sentiment of the Depression era. In beginning a two-day trip to visit auto workers here and home builders in Dallas, the President left behind the simmering controversy in Washington over his foreign policy, especially the attempt to undermine the Nicaraguan Government. Awaiting him were lunch-pail scenes carefully scouted by his political strategists to emphasize the domestic economy as his chief re-election selling point.
4/11/1984	GM AGENCY EXPANDS ITS INQUIRY ON BRAKING SYSTEMS TO FORD	The Government, already pressing a suit to have 1.1 million General Motors automobiles recalled because of brakes that lock prematurely, today announced an investigation into reports of similar problems in 431,000 Ford cars. The investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is concentrated on 1979 Ford Mustangs and Mercury Capris. The agency received 160 complaints about brakes locking.
4/5/1984	FORD'S CHALLENGE TO EUROPE	The Ford Motor Company's newest automobile, scheduled to be introduced in September, will not be a Ford, a Mercury or a Lincoln. It will be a Merkur (pronounced mare-COOR), a separate car line the company is establishing in an effort to appeal to buyers who otherwise prefer, and can afford, the European sedans sold by BMW, Saab, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz. The Merkur will be the first car since the ill-fated Edsel of the 1950's that Ford has brought out in this country without the Ford, Lincoln or Mercury nameplate. (It could be noted, however, that Merkur is the German word for Mercury.) And Ford acknowledges that it is going counter to conventional marketing wisdom in choosing a name that people will inevitably mispronounce.
4/5/1984	LATE MARCH AUTO SALES ROSE 18.7%	The nation's major domestic auto makers said today that new car sales in the last 10 days of March rose 18.7 percent from a year earlier, to the best end-of- March selling total since 1981. At the same time, the auto makers said, sales for the entire month rose 26 percent from a year earlier, to the best total for March since 1979. ''These sales looked fine,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an automotive industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. Mr. Phillippi said sales should remain high through this summer because of the large number of consumers who have yet to buy new cars in the current recovery. The six companies - G.M., Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold 313,443 new cars in the March 21-31 period, up from 263,963 a year earlier. For the month, the companies reported sales of 756,164, up from 600,303.
3/24/1984	MID-MARCH AUTO SALES UP BY 33.7%	New-car sales in mid-March rose 33.7 percent over the same selling period last year, the nation's six major manufacturers reported today. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - reported sales of 231,481 cars in the March 11-20 period, up from 173,125 in the 1983 period, when Honda was not yet producing in this country. Both periods had eight selling days.
3/16/1984	Toyo Kogyo Study Of U.S. Plant Sites	The Toyo Kogyo Company, which makes Mazda cars, said today that it is studying three locations in the United States where it may establish auto manufacturng operations. Yoshiki Yamasaki, Toyo Kogyo's president, said the company would operate the plant on its own, without any connection to the Ford Motor Company, which owns 25 percent of Toyo Kogyo's stock.
3/15/1984	MARCH 1-10 AUTO SALES ROSE 31.5%	The nation's six major auto makers reported today that sales in the March 1-10 period surged 31.5 percent from a year earlier, continuing the stronger- than-expected pace that has prevailed since December. Analysts and industry executives said the early-March figures showed that sales could be expected to remain strong for the remainder of the model year. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold 211,240 cars in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last, when they sold 160,617. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate was 8.1 million domestic units in the period. Most analysts had expected sales in the first quarter of about 7.5 to 7.8 million domestically produced units, but an 8.3 million rate for the month of January and an 8.5 million rate in February caused some to revise their forecasts for the year and brought about some minor adjustments in production schedules by the manufacturers for the second quarter.
3/8/1984	Ford to Export Engines	The Ford Motor Company said today that it planned to export up to 250,000 automobile engines a year from its Dearborn, Mich., engine plant to Ford of Europe, beginning in 1986.
3/6/1984	FEB. 21-29 AUTO SALES ROSE 24.6%	The nation's major automobile manufacturers reported today that sales rose 24.6 percent, on a daily rate basis, in late February. The companies, G.M., Ford, Chrysler, A.M.C., VW and Honda, sold a total of 248,062 units in the Feb. 21-29 period, which had eight selling days this year and seven last year. Sales for the entire month of February, with 25 selling days this year and 24 last year, were up 42.5 percent, to 655,016. The daily selling rate of 26,201 was the best daily rate for February since 1979. Last year the car makers sold 441,226 cars, or 18,384 a day, in the month.
2/23/1984	U.S. TO TEST AIR BAGS ON FORDS	The Federal Government announced today that it would buy 5,000 Ford automobiles equipped with air bags, both to test the safety devices and to encourage automakers to equip new cars with them. The cars cost $7,000 apiece, of which $1,050 is for the air bag and other safety features, according to the General Services Administration, the purchasing department for the Government. Gerald P. Carmen, G.S.A. Administrator, said the purchase was part of a Government effort to encourage the auto industry ''to start offering competitively priced safety improvements and devices so that the American people will have the opportunity to purchase them.''
2/15/1984	FEB. 1-10 AUTO SALES ROSE 32.6%	Sales of new American-made automobiles rose 32.6 percent in the first 10 days of February from the corresponding period last year, the manufacturers reported today. The six major companies, General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen and American Honda, sold 181,694 cars in the Feb. 1-10 period, or 20,188 daily, the best daily selling rate for the early February period since 1979. The companies sold 137,078 cars in Feb. 1-10, 1983. There were nine selling days in both periods.
2/10/1984	AUTO SALES EXECUTIVES LIFT SIGHTS	Auto executives, encouraged by unusually strong car sales in January, are cautiously raising their sights for all of 1984. At the beginning of the 1984 model year in October, most auto executives and analysts were estimating total car sales for the calendar year at between 10 million and 10.3 million. But with an annualized sales rate of 10.25 million in January, when sales are traditionally slowed by bad weather, some auto executives say sales of 10.5 million or more seem possible. Strong Sales Rate ''The sales rate is very strong, maybe even stronger than we can understand,'' Philip Benton, vice president for marketing at the Ford Motor Company, said today. Mr. Benton, along with many other auto industry figures, was in Chicago for activities associated with the city's annual auto show.
2/7/1984	MINIVAN A HIT FOR CHRYSLER	Car dealers for the Chrysler Corporation are complaining about a shortage of the company's new minivan, but they have little hope of relief this year. The small vans, known as the Plymouth Voyager and the Dodge Caravan, were an instant success for Chrysler when the company started sending them to dealers late last year. Officially the vehicle went on sale early in January. ''I just wish I had some to sell,'' Jack Helfman, owner of River Oaks Chrysler Plymouth in Houston, said last week. ''If I had 200 on hand I wouldn't be worried. I've never seen so much activity on a vehicle.''
1/25/1984	FORD DIESELS	In a bid to lure buyers of European models, the Ford Motor Company introduced a turbo-charged diesel engine built by the German auto maker BMW that will be available in Lincoln luxury cars. Robert Rewey, the general sales manager of Lincoln-Mercury, also said that Ford is running short of diesel versions of its subcompact Escort and Lynx models.
1/23/1984	Ford Recalling Mark VII's	The Ford Motor Company said Friday that it was recalling 12,400 Mark VII luxury cars to repair a defect in the antitheft device that could cause the steering wheel to lock.
1/17/1984	Ford Expects Record Year	The Ford Motor Company's earnings for 1983 are likely to hit record levels, Philip Caldwell, the company's chairman, suggested today. In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, Mr. Caldwell said, ''When the major auto companies release their 1983 financial results in a few weeks time, you will discover that they will stand in comparison with some of the best years we have ever had.''
1/6/1984	DETROIT CLOSES OUT A BANNER YEAR	For United States auto makers, 1983 was a year when rebates ended and sharp cost cutting combined with solid sales to produce a financial turnaround that analysts said was little short of spectacular. The industry reported today that it continued its rebound last year from the worst sales slump since World War II, selling 6,786,977 cars for the year, an increase of 17.9 percent over the 5,756,658 sold in 1982. Including import sales of 2,368,764, a total of 9,155,741 cars were sold in the United States in 1983, making it the best sales year since 1979, when 10.5 million were sold. Sales in 1982 totaled 7,955,970.
12/24/1983	Ford to Pay $1 Million in Case	The Ford Motor Company has agreed to pay at least $1.1 million to the mother and sister of a young woman who died when the gasoline tank of a 1974 Mustang II caught fire in a 1980 crash. The family of the late Jo Pauline Collins, of Lynwood, contended that Ford had known the tanks were ''defectively designed'' but had calculated that it would be cheaper to settle lawsuits than modify the automobiles.
12/15/1983	Ford Planning Recalls Of 300,000 Vehicles	The Ford Motor Company today announced five recalls involving nearly 300,000 automobiles and trucks, including most of its 1984 passenger car models. About 290,000 of the vehicles are being recalled to repair shoulder-belt attachments that do not meet Federal safety standards.
12/13/1983	Edsel B. Ford 2d Gets Ford Advertising Post The Ford division of the Ford Motor Company has chosen a new advertising manager with an old name: Edsel B. Ford 2d, a great-grandson of Henry Ford, was promoted to the advertising position from his former job as marketing product plans manager for the division.	Mr. Ford, 34, who joined the company as a product analyst in 1974 and has held sales and marketing posts in this country and was assistant managing director of Ford's Australian subsidiary for two years, is the son of Henry Ford 2d, who ran the company from 1945 until stepping down as chief executive in 1979. Henry Ford 2d remains chairman of the finance committee of the board of directors.
12/10/1983	FORD PLANS $200 MILLION STEEL UNIT	The Ford Motor Company said today that it would invest $200 million in a modern continuous slab-casting facility for its aging Rouge Steel complex, just outside Detroit, bringing new life to a plant that was threatened with being closed down earlier this year. Announcing Ford's plans during a meeting with hourly workers at the plant, Philip Caldwell, the company's chairman, said: ''While others are banking their furnaces, we're rebuilding and adding to ours. We've committed the financial investment to a new facility that will allow us to make a quantum leap in technology and efficiency.'' Ford officials said that they expect the continuous casting facility to begin operating in the middle of 1986.
12/2/1983	Ford Recall	The Ford Motor Company said it would recall 1,200 employees to its assembly plant in Hapeville next year, starting up the plant's second shift, which was discontinued in August 1979. A Ford official, Henry Nida, said the company will ask the 930 employees laid off in 1979 to return. The remainder will be recruited from other Ford plants.
11/24/1983	NOV. 11-20 CAR SALES DOWN 6.4%	The domestic automobile manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars fell 6.4 percent in the Nov. 11-20 period from the corresponding period a year earlier. It was the first decline since mid-May. The results, however, were skewed by a nearly 14 percent decline in sales by the General Motors Corporation, the industry's sales leader, reflecting financing incentives last November. The other five domestic auto makers - Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - reported flat to sharply higher sales.
11/6/1983	OWNERS OF DETROIT CENTER FORM A NEW PARTNERSHIP	The Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit was opened with great excitement in 1977 as investors and civic leaders hoped it would serve as a catalyst for the rebirth of the city's business district. It was completed, however, just before the automobile industry and the city were gripped by the worst economic recession in 40 years. As 1983 began, the Renaissance Center, unable to meet its mortgage commitments, was threatened with foreclosure. This week the partners who own Ren Cen, as it is known here, and the center's mortgage-holders hoisted a champagne toast to themselves over a new financial understanding that amounts to a bailout for the center.
11/4/1983	OCT. 21-31 AUTO SALES ROSE 25.5%	Domestic auto sales in the last 10 days of October rose 25.5 percent over a very slow period last year, the companies reported today. The six major auto companies said they sold a total of 236,895 cars in the Oct. 21-31 period versus 188,700 in the same period last year. Both periods had nine selling days. The daily selling rate of 26,322 was the best for the period since a daily pace of 27,969 cars was set in late October 1979. Last year's daily rate for the period was only 20,814 units.
11/4/1983	HOUSE 219-199, VOTES TO REQUIRE U.S. MADE PARTS IN IMPORTED CARS	In an expression of concern over extensive imports of Japanese cars, the House of Representatives approved a bill today that would require imported cars to be built with a substantial component of American parts and labor. The legislation, approved by a vote of 219 to 199, would take effect in 1987. It is aimed chiefly at Japanese manufacturers, whose exports now account for nearly 20 percent of all cars sold in the United States. If the Republican-controlled Senate approves the bill, which is considered unlikely, foreign auto makers would be forced either to increase manufacturing activity here or to reduce sales.
11/3/1983	Auto Financings	The Ford Motor Company and the American Motors Corporation have extended their 12.9 percent interest rate programs through November. Ford's program is narrowed to include only dealers in Alaska, California, Washington and Oregon and is offered only on some vehicles. A.M.C.'s program is nationwide and on 1983 and 1984 A.M.C., Jeep and Renault vehicles.
11/2/1983	COMPLAINTS IN DETROIT ABOUT JAPANESE LIMIT	News Analysis DETROIT, Nov. 1 - American auto makers apparently are trying to build a case for permanent limits on imports of Japanese cars, a goal that clashes with the latest agreement to extend quotas for another year, until March 1985. Officials of the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and the American Motors Corporation complain that the relative weakness of the yen and the Japanese practice of forgiving taxes on exports give Japanese auto makers a permanent and ''unfair'' cost advantage. The one-year extension of import quotas just negotiated by the Japanese and American Governments, they say, is not sufficent help. Until recent months, the auto companies had been talking about a need for temporary restraints, while they retooled factories to build the small and fuel-efficient models needed to compete with Japanese cars. Now they are saying that restrictions on Japanese auto imports will be needed for years if the industry is to survive. Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, was the most outspoken today. Commenting on the agreement for import quotas of 1.85 million cars in the year starting next April 1, up from 1.68 million cars now, he said: ''Make no mistake, this 'transitional agreement' is a serious blow to the U.S. auto producers, suppliers, dealers, their employees and laid-off workers, who are being hurt by the unfair advantages enjoyed by the Japanese auto industry and whose problems were not corrected by these negotiations.''
10/28/1983	Ford Callbacks	The Ford Motor Company said it would call back to work more than 300 workers early next year at its Louisville, Ky., truck assembly plant. After the callbacks, which will begin in January, the plant will employ about 2,500 hourly and salaried employees.
10/28/1983	FORD POSTS A PROFIT IN QUARTER	The Ford Motor Company, continuing the series of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings reports in the automobile industry, today reported a profit of $333 million, or $1.83 a share, compared to a loss of $325 million a year earlier. Analysts had been estimating that Ford would earn about $250 million. The four domestically based auto companies thus had a combined profit of $1.16 billion for the quarter, against a combined loss of $218 million in the comparable 1982 period. Earlier this week, the General Motors Corporation reported a profit of $737 million and the Chrysler Corporation reported one of $100 million. Only the American Motors Corporation, by far the smallest company in the group, had a loss, of $9.1 million.
10/26/1983	AUTO SALES ROSE 41.1% IN MID-OCTOBER PERIOD	The nation's six major auto manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars jumped 41.1 percent in the mid-October period from the same period last year, when sales were the lowest in more than two decades. The combined new car sales for Oct. 11 through Oct. 20 were 235,334, compared with 166,785 in the same period last year, when sales were at a 24-year low. In addition, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for mid-October was 7.6 million units, a sharp rise from the 6.7 million-unit rate in the first 10 days of the month.
10/21/1983	Ford Expansion	The Ford Motor Company said it is planning a $246 million expansion and modernization of its truck assembly plant in St. Paul. The move will allow Ford to increase production of its Ranger compact pickup trucks, now built only in Louisville, Ky., a Ford spokesman said.
10/15/1983	Turkish Company Gets Ford Link	The Ford Motor Company announced that it would buy 30 percent of the Turkish auto maker Otomobil Sanayii Anomin Sirketi, over the next three years to expand Ford's presence in the region. A Ford spokesman, Allan Dreyfuss, declined to disclose the dollar value of the acquisition, terms of which include putting two Ford representatives on the Turkish company's nine- member board of directors.
10/14/1983	Ford Splits Shares And Raises Payout	The Ford Motor Company, citing a favorable outlook in the auto industry, said today that it is raising the quarterly dividend on its common stock by 15 cents, to 45 cents a share. The company also announced a 3-for-2 stock split, which will be in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend. Both the stock split and the dividend increase will be payable Dec. 1 to shareholders of record Nov. 1.
10/14/1983	AUTO SALES SURGE 45% IN PERIOD	The nation's six major auto manufacturers opened the 1984 model year on a high note, reporting today that sales in the first 10 days of October rose 45 percent from the same period a year earlier. The producers said sales in the period were 191,695 units, up from 132,386 in the 1982 period. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for the period rose to 6.7 million units, from 4.9 million units in the 1982 period and 6.4 million in the last 10 days of September.
10/5/1983	BIG 3'S '83 CAR SALES UP 16.7%	The Big Three auto makers ended the 1983 model year with a 16.7 percent increase in sales, the companies reported today. It was the first time since 1978 that the domestic auto makers had been able to report a year-to-year improvement in sales. The increase in sales has brought a dramatic turnabout in the financial outlook for the industry, which reported combined losses of more than $8 billion during 1979, 1980 and 1981. The increased sales, combined with new labor contracts and other cost- cutting measures have led analysts to estimate that the Big Three will report combined earnings of about $5 billion for the 1983 calendar year.
9/29/1983	Rouge Steel Recall	The Ford Motor Company said it will recall between 650 and 750 workers at its Rouge Steel subsidiary beginning next week.
9/28/1983	PLAN FOR AUTO TRACK IN FLORIDA IS TERMED MENACE TO PANTHERS	A proposal to build a Ford automobile test track in southwest Florida is being opposed by environmentalists, who say it would further narrow the range of the endangered Florida panther. Only 20 panthers are thought to remain in southwest Florida. Their primary habitat is the Cypress National Preserve, the Everglades National Park and the Sakahatchee Strand, a 30,000-acre subtropical wilderness now being purchased by the state as part of a progam to protect the Everglades and its wildlife. But panthers living in and around the strand often wander outside the area to find food, according to wildlife officials.
9/27/1983	Japanese Weighing Car Limit Renewal	The three-year program restricting the flow of Japanese automobiles into the United States still has six months more to run, but the campaign to extend it in some form for another year is already well under way. The Big Three auto makers in Detroit recently stated their positions on the matter. The Ford Motor Company wants the restrictions to continue at the current level of 1.68 million cars a year. The Chrysler Corporation would like the quota lowered.
9/24/1983	10-DAY AUTO SALES CLIMB 3.8%	Sales of new cars by the nation's three largest auto producers rose 3.8 percent in the Sept. 11-20 period, the companies reported today. A slim increase had been expected because mid-September last year was one of the few strong selling periods of 1982 and inventory shortages are now plaguing dealers. The Ford Motor Company said its sales grew 27.5 percent, while the Chrysler Corporation reported a 35.6 percent jump. But sales of the General Motors Corporation fell 8.8 percent. The three companies altogether sold 155,990 new cars in the period, up from 150,284 last year.
9/24/1983	FORD PLANT VOTES CONCESSIONS	Workers at the Ford Motor Company's Rouge automaking complex overwhelmingly approved a contract tonight that will cut wages and benefits for 4,000 company steelworkers by $4 an hour. Members of Local 600 of the United Automobile Workers, including steelworkers and others at the complex, voted 5,788 to 3,033 to approve the contract, said a union spokesman, Steve Wyatt. The action means Ford will rescind plans to close Rouge Steel, will recall some laid-off workers and will continue modernizing the plant, a company spokesman, Richard Judy, said after the vote.
9/21/1983	FORD MIGHT SUE TO BAR TOYOTA-G.M. VENTURE	A top official of the Ford Motor Company said today that Ford might join with other domestic auto companies in filing an antitrust suit to block the proposed joint venture between the General Motors Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation. Harold A. Poling, Ford's executive vice president for domestic automotive operations, said ''an antitrust suit is one alternative that would have to be considered'' if the Federal Trade Commission approves the tie between G.M., the world's largest auto company, and Toyota, the third largest. Ford is the second-largest auto company in the world. Until now, opposition to the joint venture, which is to produce Toyota-designed subcompacts at G.M.'s Fremont, Calif., assembly plant, had been led by the Chrysler Corporation.
9/19/1983	DETROIT STRESSING STYLE FOR '84	The nation's automobile manufacturers seem confident that affluent customers are returning in large numbers as the recession fades. What is more, these buyers may be ready to trade in their fuel-efficient subcompact cars for more powerful and luxurious models. So Detroit is gearing up for the 1984 model year with a new emphasis on performance and styling, rather than mileage and price. Strong sales of full-size and sporty cars have fueled the auto industry's recovery so far, and Detroit is shaping its 1984 lineup in an attempt to continue to take advantage of this trend. ''With gas prices stable right now, people don't seem to care about fuel economy as much as they did a year or two ago,'' said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. ''Detroit is simply following the market.''
9/15/1983	BIG THREE AUTO SALES CLIMB 20%	The nation's Big Three automobile manufacturers reported today that sales for the first 10 days of September were up 20 percent from very weak sales in the same period a year ago. Analysts expressed optimism for the the fourth quarter and for 1984. The three companies, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation sold 125,051 new cars, compared with 104,227 in the comparable period last year. There were eight selling days in the Sept. 1-10 period in 1983 and 1982.
9/14/1983	Ford Says It's Closing Steel Plant	The Ford Motor Company today notified the 850 nonunion employees of its Rouge Steel subsidiary that the big mill would be closed, possibly within a year, because the company had been unable to reach agreement on concessions with the 3,500 unionized workers there. Ford officials said talks with the United Automobile Workers, which have been going on since May 24, had been broken off by the company. They made it clear that Ford was dissatisfied with the progress of the negotiations, in which Ford was seeking to reduce wages that it says are $5 an hour higher at Rouge Steel than in the rest of the American steel industry.
9/14/1983	Ford to Raise '84 Prices About 2.3%	The Ford Motor Company, following the lead of the General Motors Corporation, announced that it is increasing the prices of its 1984 models an average 2.3 percent, or $254, putting the price of the average Ford auto at $11,200.
9/13/1983	Shift at Ford Plant	The Ford Motor Company's assembly plant in Hapeville, Ga., has begun production of the midsized 1984 Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. The plant has been building Ford Thunderbirds since Jan. 31, and will continue its Thunderbird production at a lower rate, dropping from 50 units an hour to 31 an hour. A company spokesman said Ford is considering adding the Mercury Cougar to the plant's production by the end of the year.
9/12/1983	MAJOR CORPORATIONS ASK WORKERS TO PAY MORE OF HEALTH COST	Some of the nation's largest corporations are asking their employees to pay a bigger portion of their health-care bills than in the past. If adopted nationwide, the practice would mark a reversal of one of the most widespread and generous employee benefits in America. This summer five large companies - A.T.& T., Ford, Chrysler, W. R. Grace and Citibank - have asked their employees to pay an increased share of their health costs. Ford, Citibank and Grace in effect dictated this policy to their white-collar, nonunion employees. At A.T.& T. and Chrysler, both bargaining with unions, the request that workers shoulder more of their health costs met bitter resentment. Union representatives negotiating contracts with the two companies flatly rejected the idea, and the companies dropped it, at least temporarily.
9/11/1983	AT FORD, A QUIET REVOLUTION UNFOLDS	IT was the spring of 1980 when Donald E. Petersen, the newly named president of the Ford Motor Company, visited the corporate styling center to have a look at clay models of cars proposed for the future. Noticing that the designers there seemed a bit glum about what was in store for the next few years, Mr. Petersen asked if they really liked what they were presenting. The answer was no, and the upshot was a decision shortly thereafter by Mr. Petersen and the new chairman and chief executive officer, Phillip Caldwell, to loosen the reins that Ford executives had held on designers for years - perhaps permanently altering the way automobiles go from concept to finished product in Detroit. Since that time, designers at the No. 2 auto maker have been allowed to develop ideas without worrying too much about the whims of their bosses. Out of that freedom has come the smooth, uncluttered, sleekly aerodynamic look of Ford's new models, a sharp departure from the square, formal appearance of its older cars - and from everyone else's designs, too.
9/7/1983	AUTO SALES HELD BACK BY DROP IN INVENTORIES	Sales for the nation's Big Three auto makers rose a slight 13.1 percent in the Aug. 21-31 period, the companies reported today, with dealers unable to fill some orders because of drastically low inventories. From mid-June to early August, 10- day sales gains had ranged from 37.1 percent to 73 percent. But starting in mid-August, the increases in sales began to diminish as the shortage grew of cars ready for delivery. The three companies, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, sold 179,769 new cars in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last. The companies sold 158,928 cars in late August 1982.
9/6/1983	CHRYSLER AND AUTO WORKERS AGREE ON CONTRACT EXTENSION	Negotiatiors for the Chrysler Corporation and the United Automobile Workers reached tentative agreement on a new labor contract today, Owen F. Bieber, the union's president reported. Mr. Bieber said details of the pact, which will extend the current contract that was to expire Jan. 14, are being withheld until the union's 160-member Chrysler Council meets Tuesday. ''I believe the contract will be well received by the council and will, in fact, represent equity for our people,'' Mr. Bieber said. There was no immediate comment from Chrysler.
8/30/1983	AUTO MAKERS FEAR BIG FINES IF FUEL ECONOMY RULES AREN'T CHANGED	The country's two largest automobile companies are now almost certain that only relaxation of Federal fuel economy regulations can save them from heavy fines, according to officials of the companies. Both the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company have reported to the Government that they would not meet ''corporate average fuel economy'' standards this year and in the next few years, largely because sales of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars have slowed while those of bigger cars with thirstier engines have increased. The mileage standards increase each year until reaching 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985, meaning that the average fuel consumption of the cars each company produces and sells must not exceed that ceiling. The standards were passed by Congress in 1975 in response to the first Arab oil embargo. They were meant to force the auto companies to produce more efficient cars to lessen the country's dependence on imported fuel.
8/29/1983	Ford Motor Marketing	The Ford Motor Company plans to sell two foreign-made cars in the United States, beginning a year from now, according to Advertising Age magazine. The trade magazine, in an article scheduled for publication today, said the auto maker will market the Sierra XR4 from Ford of Europe and a version of the Australian Telstar, which will be made in Mexico.
8/25/1983	BIG THREE AUTO SALES UP 19.8%	New-car sales continued to show year-to-year gains in the mid-August period, with the Big Three auto makers today reporting a 19.8 percent improvement from the same period in 1982. But the rate of recovery from depressed levels a year ago has slowed because of low dealer inventories and the elimination of incentives for buyers. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for all the major domestic auto companies, which is the broadest measure of the overall health of the industry, was 6.2 million units in the Aug. 11-20 period, compared with 7.9 million in early August and 5.1 million in mid-August of last year. The companies had been selling cars at rates of more than 7 million units since late May.
8/16/1983	CAR SALES UP 40.1% IN 10 DAYS	The Big Three auto makers reported today that sales of new cars rose 40.1 percent in the Aug. 1-10 period, on a daily-selling-rate basis, the eighth consecutive year-to-year increase. The three companies, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, sold an average of 19,028 cars a day in the period, which had nine selling days this year and eight last year. The three sold an average of 13,585 autos daily in early August of 1982.
8/16/1983	Ford Will Offer A Plastic Bumper	The Ford Motor Company will put an all- plastic bumper that needs no metal reinforcement or backing bar on some 1984 subcompacts, the company said. The new bumper, the first in the United States to use a blend of polycarbonate and polyester made by the General Electric Company, would be lighter than conventional metal bumpers and resistant to corrosion, a Ford spokesman, Jim Olson, said.
8/4/1983	AUTO SALES BY BIG 3 UP 37.1%	The Big Three auto makers reported today that sales surged 37.1 percent in the last 10 days of July, continuing the recovery that has been pushing up sales sharply since April. The General Motors Corporation, the industry giant, said its 10-day sales rose 44.3 percent from last year, on a daily selling rate basis. The Chrylser Corporation, the No. 3 auto maker, said sales jumped 48.5 percent in the July 21-31 period, while at the Ford Motor Company, sales were up 17 percent. For all of July, sales by all the domestic manufacturers, including American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda, totaled 576,864, up 39.6 percent.
