And I take the same approach with the players. I tell them exactly what it is at the beginning and then I explain to them why. I think it really hits them, and they get it right away. I'm not a coach to be on them 24/7. I let them play.''

Krzyzewski, a four-time N.C.A.A. champion in his 31st year as Duke's coach, declined to comment Thursday when asked about a statement made by the former Michigan guard Jalen Rose on Sunday in the ESPN documentary ''The Fab Five'' about the famed recruiting class at Michigan in the early 1990s.
2011-03-17	Some Thoughts on Duke, the Fab Five and Name-Calling	''The Fab Five,'' an ESPN film about the Michigan basketball careers of Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Chris Webber, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson from 1991 to 1993, was broadcast for the first time Sunday night. In the show, Rose, the show's executive producer, stated that Duke recruited only black players he considered to be ''Uncle Toms.'' Grant Hill, a player on the Duke team that beat Michigan in the 1992 Final Four, reflected on Rose's comments. I am a fan, friend and longtime competitor of the Fab Five. I have competed against Jalen Rose and Chris Webber since the age of 13. At Michigan, the Fab Five represented a cultural phenomenon that impacted the country in a permanent and positive way. The very idea of the Fab Five elicited pride and promise in much the same way the Georgetown teams did in the mid-1980s when I was in high school and idolized them. Their journey from youthful icons to successful men today is a road map for so many young, black men (and women) who saw their journey through the powerful documentary, ''The Fab Five.''

The effect would be familiar to anyone accustomed to watching basketball on television who is sitting in good seats in an arena: a sudden appreciation for the physical size of the players on the court. The biggest story on Friday, of course, was LeBron James's first visit to Madison Square Garden since he signed with the Heat. But Friday also marked the first N.B.A. game that could be watched at home in 3-D, and the N.B.A. and ESPN, which have been experimenting with 3-D production for four years, were hoping that it would help drive wider adoption of a technology that has yet to truly catch on.

2010-05-09	30 SECONDS WITH DAVE WINFIELD; Moved by Big Hit And the Memory Of His Mother	The Hall of Famer Dave Winfield, 58, is an executive vice president and senior adviser for the San Diego Padres and an analyst for ''Baseball Tonight'' on ESPN. Winfield played for six teams, including the Padres and the Yankees, during a 22-year career in which he won a World Series with the 1992 Toronto Blue Jays. He is also spokesman for Ask.com, whose Answers for the Cure program benefits Susan G. Komen for the Cure, an organization that raises money for breast cancer. To honor his mother, Arline, who died of breast cancer, Winfield is encouraging people to download a special baseball-themed search page at Ask.com/forthecure.Q.Many major league players use pink bats and wear pink wrist bands and ribbons for Mother's Day to raise awareness about breast cancer. How important is it to spread this message?A.It's extremely important, and we need to get tested early; that can make all the difference. My mother passed away in 1988, and the cancer was detected in 1987. I was playing with the Yankees at that time and we had just finished playing the Twins in Minnesota and she said she was going to the doctor because she felt a lump in her breast and she was going to get it checked out. Even with the sizable resources and connections I had, there wasn't enough time to catch it.Q.How do you feel about players associated with steroids in terms of Hall of Fame enshrinement?A.Truth be told, these guys took a calculated risk to improve their performance, to get a contract, to win awards, and to be considered one of the best in the game by maximizing their performance. But the Hall of Fame? I don't think they belong; I don't think they deserve it. They walked away with a lot of money, a lot of awards and a lot of broken records, which they will keep, but they took a different path than the path I think guys should have taken who played the game.Q.What is the highlight of your baseball career?A.Winning the World Series in Toronto. Growing up, we would play baseball and every practice would end with the same scenario: I'm up at the plate, there's men on base and the World Series is on the line and bam, you get that hit and win it all. It took me almost 20 years in the game to achieve that reality. You achieve something great, you become an immortal, and that's something that can never be taken away from you.Q.Any regrets in baseball?A.On a serious note, I wish that George Steinbrenner and I had a different and more friendly relationship when I played in New York because it made it tougher than it needed to be. I spoke to George extensively a couple of years ago, before his health became an issue, and all of the bad stuff is behind us. You don't want to see anyone in ill health, but I'm glad we settled our issues some time ago. On a fun note, I regret the fact that I never had a chance to pitch in the major leagues. I was a pitcher in college, but I never even got a chance to mop up in the pros. I would have loved to kick that leg up high and pull a Juan Marichal on somebody, or if some batter was digging in to much at the plate, to pull a Bob Gibson and hit somebody in the ribs and say, ''What, what, what are you going to do?''Q.Derek Jeter idolized you as a young player. What does that mean to you?A.It means a great deal. I found out that I was his idol growing up shortly after he made it to the major leagues. To hear that from a young player is great, even greater now that he has become the Yankee captain, a legend who is the team's all-time hits leader. It's a good thing, believe me.Q.Where would Dave Winfield, in his prime, fit in on the current Yankees?A.Who plays right field? They would have to play somewhere else, I guess. Oh, Swish, my man Nick. I'm sorry, but he'll be all right.Q.Why did you elect to go into the Hall of Fame as a Padre instead of a Yankee?A.It was a tough decision, but in the end, the Padres were the team that drafted me right out of college and allowed me to play major league baseball without going to the minor leagues, and I accomplished a lot of good things. How can I not say I was a part of the great Yankee organization? You can only choose one hat, and I went with the team that took me to the dance.Q.Are you concerned with the fact that fewer African-Americans are playing baseball?A.Yes, I am, and we need to do something to stem the tide and turn the situation around. I have a seminar I teach about the problems that African-Americans now have playing baseball in urban areas. One problem is that it costs a lot of money to play nowadays in urban areas. When I was growing up, America was different. Back then, African-Americans weren't that interested in sports other than baseball. Now there's a lot of competition from football and basketball and even the X Games. In the end, I think it's up to each individual community to take the necessary steps to see that the sport is alive and well and available to everyone in every community.

It was the third-most-viewed preseason game on ESPN. But ESPN faltered in comparison with viewership of ''Monday Night'' last season, the last of its long run on ABC Sports. The 5.4 million who watched the Oakland-Minnesota game represented a 40 percent drop from the 9.1 million viewers for the first ''Monday Night'' game last year on ABC. RICHARD SANDOMIR (NYT)

As the conference finals reached their climaxes, two Miami Heat-Detroit Pistons matchups on ESPN were the most-watched cable shows in the week that ended on June 4. One drew 6.6 million viewers; the other brought in 6.46 million. Three Dallas Mavericks-Phoenix Suns games on TNT also made the Top 10 list of the week, putting that channel atop the primetime rankings in Nielsen's estimates. The week's most-watched entertainment show was Comedy Central's special ''Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for the Road,'' which delivered an audience of 5.31 million. The June 4 movie, starring Jeff Foxworthy, above, Larry the Cable Guy and other members of the Blue Collar troupe, was the eighth most popular show ever telecast on Comedy Central. KATE AURTHUR

2006-04-28	New Twist to Draft: A Second Network	For 26 years, ESPN had the N.F.L. draft to itself, carrying what was once deemed a nonevent, a silly, talking-heads endeavor and the sports equivalent of a political convention. But a devoted, growing viewership long ago overcame the criticism. And still, somehow, the state of the draft expert Mel Kiper Jr.'s pompadour remains relevant. ''If any event typifies how far we've come as a company, it's the N.F.L. draft,'' John Wildhack, an ESPN senior vice president, said earlier this week.
2006-04-27	Jackson Decides to Silence Voice of College Football	Keith Jackson, the storied voice of college football, is calling it quits, declining offers from ESPN officials to keep him at ABC Sports.

''I'm going out to learn to be a senior citizen and find a president I can vote for and believe in.'' He added, ''I'm not angry, I'm just going off like an old man and sitting by the creek.''
2006-04-23	N.F.L. Draft Daze: The Lost Weekend	THE Super Bowl is one thing. Plenty of women who consider themselves football widows throughout the fall can make peace with the thought of spending a few hours once a year in front of a television for a game that itself transcends sports -- an American carnival, a spectacle of money and excess, held in festive locales, with rock stars performing at halftime and plenty of color and pageantry along the way. The N.F.L. draft, however, is something else. Officially known as the National Football League's annual player selection meeting, the draft is basically a weekend where representatives from each professional football team gather in Manhattan and divvy up last season's crop of collegiate talent. Each team allowed to pick one player per round (barring trades) over the course of seven rounds to add to next season's roster.
2006-04-18	Bonds Put In Spotlight, Not on Spot	BARRY BONDS isn't breaking news in his ESPN vanity series, ''Bonds on Bonds,'' which may be the best thing for a network partly divided by a debate over whether he is being paid by ESPN, through an outside producer, to give access that he normally would not give. ''SportsCenter,'' ESPN's news program, used two clips from the first episode (one about the hate mail Bonds has received and one that showed him crying) but none from the second. The third episode will be aired tonight at 7.

''They moved the spit from the old Gleason's in Manhattan.''
2006-04-05	On ESPN, Bonds Is Shaken, Not Perturbed	''Bonds on Bonds,'' the ESPN vanity series that made its debut last night, shows a Barry Bonds that few of us know: he weeps, he talks to his father at his gravesite, he mops up the mess from a busted aquarium pipe in his house, he wonders why he is not GQ's most-hated athlete. He is, in a production that he sought out and controls, a new man, a man in full who is fully in control of 10 hours of ESPN/ESPN2's time. (The show will, at various times, appear on each network.) He is happy and angry, the recipient of vile hate mail, the lover of fans who love him.
2006-04-02	After Luck With Poker, ESPN Bets on New York Dominoes	The next big thing in sports programming is dominoes? To the occasional domino player, it is a stretch to even call this quiet game of straight-faced strategy a sport. But anyone who has spent time in a Latino neighborhood in New York City could testify that dominoes played there -- with the slammed-down tiles, the verbal sparring, the bragging and bluffing -- is no parlor game.
2006-03-31	Reality Bites Back: Some at ESPN Assail Bonds Show	A two-day seminar attended by ESPN personnel at an airport hotel in Hartford earlier this week exposed a schism within the network about the wisdom of televising a 10-hour reality series starring Barry Bonds. The series, ''Bonds on Bonds,'' starts Tuesday at 8 p.m. Eastern, on ESPN2. It will join the overheated Bonds-oriented news cycle that includes a raft of accusations in a new book, ''Game of Shadows,'' about his use of performance-enhancing drugs, and Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig's announcement yesterday of an investigation into steroid abuse.
2006-03-16	Passion for Classic Throws ESPN Curve	Fans are riled that ESPN and ESPN2 have not shown every game of the World Baseball Classic, which is good news for Major League Baseball. Consider the expectation-lowering concerns that were raised so recently: these were merely exhibitions; pitchers were on pitch counts; March was the wrong time; and, even worse, a Yankee might hurt himself.
2006-03-11	Newsmaker and Film Star, Bonds Puts ESPN on Spot	With Barry Bonds, real life is altering the original concept of ESPN's scheduled 10-hour cinéma vérité series. No longer is it a behind-the-scenes look at his outsize celebrity as he chases Babe Ruth's and Hank Aaron's home run totals. The subtext of any extensive work about Bonds these days is the widespread suspicion about his steroid use. Four days ago, excerpts from a new book laid out extensive details about his alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs.
2006-03-08	ESPN Rejects CBS Bid to Share Vitale	Few people are as identified with a sport as much as Dick Vitale, a connection forged by nearly 27 years of calling college basketball games at a very high volume, complemented by an idiosyncratic hoops lexicon and a shiny head. But when his sport peaks during the N.C.A.A. men's tournament, he is not at a regional site calling a game, but in an ESPN studio breathlessly dissecting bracketology. He has, in fact, never announced an N.C.A.A. tournament game. CBS Sports wanted to remedy that omission by borrowing him for one or two games next week, but in late February, ESPN rejected the bid to share him.
2006-02-20	Nielsen Will Start to Measure TV Habits of College Students	Nielsen Media Research announced last week that it would include college students living away from home in its television ratings beginning in early 2007, a move that could bolster ratings on networks like Fox, MTV and the WB, which cater to younger viewers. Currently college students are not included in the Nielsen ratings, which measure viewing habits in sample homes to determine how many people in certain age and demographic groups watch television programs. Networks and advertisers rely on the ratings to sell commercials, and the exclusion of college students who live away from home omits a potentially influential demographic. According to Nielsen, these students watch an average of 24.3 hours of television a week.
2006-02-10	Michaels Says, Th-Th-That's All, ESPN	When you have been swapped from ESPN to NBC for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, as Al Michaels has, it pays to maintain your sense of humor. A guy like Michaels has stature in sportscasting, and being exchanged for the cartoon star of ''Empty Socks'' and ''Hungry Hoboes'' might be humbling. ''This is great,'' Michaels said in an interview yesterday from Los Angeles. ''It's hysterical. I love the little ironies of life.''
2006-02-09	Michaels Cuts His Ties With 'Monday Night'	ESPN has released a discontented Al Michaels from his contract to call ''Monday Night Football'' for the next eight years and named Mike Tirico the play-by-play voice of the series for the foreseeable future. The final break with Michaels came Tuesday, two days after he called the Super Bowl on ABC; the talks culminated with his cutting his ties to ESPN as well as his contract to call National Basketball Association games on ABC Sports. ESPN and ABC are owned by the Walt Disney Company.
2006-02-05	Warning: Pregame Develops Bloating	The Super Bowl pregame show is no mere show but a symbol of the rampant gigantism endemic to the event. It was once a fairly ordinary presentation, a couple of hours long, back in a prehistoric era when TV executives had a sense of proportion and Terry Bradshaw wore a hair system. Then they learned that the bigger they grew the program, the more advertising they could sell, and they said that was very, very good. The Super Bowl pregames were XL long before time caught up to the game itself.
2006-01-31	World Classic Finds Home on ESPN Networks	The World Baseball Classic, which will be played from March 3 to March 20, will be carried by ESPN, ESPN2 and the Spanish-language ESPN Deportes, with some games also being syndicated to stations in the United States. ESPN and ESPN2 will televise a combined 16 games, with the semifinals and the finals to be shown on ESPN. Fourteen games will be syndicated to English-language stations around the country.
2006-01-24	Second Thoughts for Michaels?	In July, Al Michaels's future looked set: he would follow ''Monday Night Football'' to ESPN from ABC in a deal that lasts through 2013, thereby sticking with the series whose very name still sets his spine to tingling. But ever since November, there have been waves of speculative chatter that he wanted to get out of the contract and restart talks with NBC, whose offer he rejected. From his vacation yesterday, Michaels said nothing about his future, but through an ABC Sports spokesman, he said the ''Monday Night'' crew had ''made a pact that no one would talk about next year.''
2006-01-06	Four-Hour Rose Bowl Never Lost Its Bloom	When World Series games end in the early morning, sleep-deprived fans squawk about late starts and their impact on future generations. But the reaction to late-ending college bowl games (or the N.C.A.A. men's basketball final, which starts well past 9 p.m., Eastern time) is muted as if such concerns have been resolved by college fans' production of an elixir for wee-hour watching. Over the last few days, the length of bowl games has reached its annual state of temporal silliness. The triple-overtime Orange Bowl lasted 4 hours 49 minutes, the Fiesta 3:45, the Sugar 3:57 and the Rose an even 4 hours.
2006-01-04	NETWORK NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE	ESPN and ABC Sports dropped out of talks yesterday to renew their agreements with the PGA Tour, said two executives familiar with the terms being discussed who were granted anonymity because the negotiations were not completed. The PGA Tour is looking to conclude contracts with ESPN, ABC, CBS, NBC, USA and the Golf Channel that would replace the four-year deals that end after this coming season. Those deals are worth a total of $850 million. A third executive said that the USA Network had also dropped out of negotiations.
2006-01-03	An Old Voice Cries Out in the ESPN Wilderness	The old and new waves of the ESPN empire are merging this week in Pasadena, Calif. Yesterday, ESPN (in tandem with its broadcast wing ABC Sports) offered the world premiere of its Tournament of Roses float. And tomorrow night at the Rose Bowl, the sportscaster Keith Jackson may be calling his final college football game when Texas plays Southern California on ABC in the national championship game.
2005-12-27	With a Dandy Curtain Call, ABC Signs Off on 'Monday Night Football'	The end of ''Monday Night Football,'' as we knew it, occurred last night at Giants Stadium. The series was 36 seasons old. This isn't an obituary, because ''Monday Night'' is expected to continue, uninterrupted, on ESPN for the next eight years. But for those of a certain age, watching the final episode of 555 ''Monday Night'' games on ABC was a passage worth noting.
2005-12-26	Arts, Briefly; Football Draws for ESPN	The winding-down of the pro football season has been a boon to ESPN's ratings this month. A game between the Atlanta Falcons, left, and the Chicago Bears on Dec. 18 was advertiser-supported cable's most-watched program of the week, with 10.45 million viewers, according to Nielsen's estimates. A second N.F.L. game, the Denver Broncos versus the Buffalo Bills, was a distant No. 2, with an audience of 6.01 million. The two games added up to a victory for ESPN in prime time for the third week of December. Among entertainment channels, USA led the list, as its World Wrestling Entertainment ''Monday Night Raw'' and a viewers' choice marathon of ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' delivered large audiences. The betting show ''Deal or No Deal,'' and its 11.7 million viewers, led NBC to a Friday victory. Excluding sports, the show drew the highest 18-to-49 age group rating in Friday's 8 p.m. hour since the series premiere of CBS's ''Joan of Arcadia'' in September 2003. KATE AURTHUR

2005-12-09	TV Sports; Recapturing West Point, With Help	There is cinematic symmetry to Thomas Del Ruth being the director of photography for the ESPN film ''Code Breakers,'' about the cheating scandal at West Point that in 1951 led to the dismissals of 90 cadets, including 37 members of the Army football team. Del Ruth's late father, Roy, directed ''The West Point Story'' (1950), a frothy James Cagney-Virginia Mayo musical filmed partly on the Army campus while the scandal was still a conspiracy among the cadets. ''It's amazing,'' Del Ruth said this week by telephone. ''My dad regretted that it happened.''
2005-12-08	Nascar Drives Big Ratings to the Bank	The rise of Nascar from a regional sport to national prominence comes with a hefty payoff: nearly $4.5 billion in rights fees beginning in 2007. Nascar announced yesterday that it had signed eight-year deals with ABC, ESPN, Fox and TNT to split broadcasts of its premier Nextel Cup series that will bring in more than $560 million a year. That represents a 40 percent increase over the previous deal with Fox and NBC, a six-year contract from 2001 through 2006 that averaged $400 million a year.
2005-11-30	On Top of Their Game, Even as Time Runs Out	Al Michaels entered the restaurant as the Sunday afternoon games were starting. A half-dozen fans at the bar turned, almost in unison, as they heard his unmistakable voice and then saw Michaels, the 61-year-old ''Monday Night Football'' announcer, in a T-shirt and sweat pants. This was on the eve of the Nov. 14 Dallas-Philadelphia game, the second for the Eagles since Terrell Owens had been suspended and the 549th Monday in the history of the series. The total would not have mattered if this were not the 36th and final season for ''Monday Night'' on ABC. The series moves to ESPN next year.
2005-11-23	One Night in 1970, the Revolution Was Televised	There was a time before ''Monday Night Football,'' but that was an eon ago, when prime-time sports were rare and CBS and NBC carried the only professional football they believed they ever needed, on Sunday afternoons. But on a sultry Monday evening in Cleveland, Sept. 21, 1970, when the Browns played the Jets, that television equation was rewritten forever with the first game in a 35-year run on ABC that will end with the Super Bowl on Feb. 5.
2005-11-20	That Sports Guy Thrives Online	IT was a curious sight in Greenwich Village one balmy night this fall: hundreds of men in their 20's and early 30's lined up around a city block for a book signing, many of them decked out in team jerseys and wearing the eager expressions of teenagers on the verge of meeting a real celebrity. It's safe to say that this particular demographic is not known for its zealous attendance at book events, unless the featured ''author'' is Jenna Jameson, Howard Stern or perhaps Brett Favre. But inside, hunched over a table and signing books like mad, was an actual writer, one whose acclaim can be traced to nothing more than putting words on a blank page, a man with a misleadingly generic name: the Sports Guy, a k a Bill Simmons.
2005-11-09	ESPN the Ring Tone: In the Zone on a Cellphone	For ESPN, the inexorable result of 26 years of feeding sports to millions of people and fueling fans' desires for ever bigger screens is surprisingly small. It is, in fact, really small, yet designed to drive the supersized ESPN brand further into the sports zeitgeist.
2005-11-03	ESPN, ESPN2, ABC Get World Cup Rights	ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC Sports yesterday announced their acquisition of the television rights to the next two World Cups and Women's World Cups through 2014 for an estimated $100 million. Univision said it would pay $325 million for the Spanish-language rights. The total is 123 percent above what FIFA, soccer's world governing body, received for the 2002 and 2006 World Cup rights in the United States. NBC Universal and Telemundo, its Spanish-language network, made a pre-emptive bid of $333 million ($275 million of it for the Spanish-language rights), which one FIFA committee accepted. But FIFA's executive committee opened the auction at the request of Chuck Blazer, the only American on the powerful executive committee, who wanted bidders to include a rights deal for Major League Soccer. It was Telemundo's rich bid that induced Univision to go far beyond the $150 million that it paid for the 2002-6 cycle of World Cup rights.
2005-10-23	Bull's-Eye: TV's Next No-Limit Wager	IF you had predicted two and a half years ago that the next great American sports television phenomenon -- right up there with Nascar, figure skating and the ''fitness personality'' John Basedow -- was going to be poker, lots of supposedly smart people would have laughed, pointed and called you names. Of course, that was before the summer of 2003, with the Travel Channel's World Poker Tour and ESPN's edited-like-a-reality-show update of the World Series of Poker (with the perfectly-named Chris Moneymaker, a Walter Mitty in a baseball cap, winning the $2.5 million jackpot). The combination turned Texas Hold 'Em into a national craze. Televised poker suddenly popped up on Bravo, Fox Sports and even NBC. Viewers, especially young, male, beer-drinking, truck-buying viewers, went, as they say at the tables, all in. And the ratings have shown no signs of diminishing.
2005-10-17	ESPN Sports-Speak Is Increasingly Also Becoming Sports-Write	To many sportswriters, scoring a touchdown in football has become ''taking it to the house.'' Hitting a home run has become ''taking it deep.'' And a hot young basketball player has become a ''diaper dandy.'' According to a new survey of sports journalists by a doctoral student, ESPN is to blame. Scott Reinhardy, who is working toward a Ph.D. at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, surveyed 249 sports journalists gathered at the Associated Press Sports Editors Convention in 2004, focusing on the use of sports jargon in newspaper writing. He found a widespread acknowledgment that ESPN-speak has entered the common vernacular of newspaper sportswriting.
2005-10-15	ESPN and ABC to Take Nascar From TNT-NBC	ESPN and ABC Sports are expected to announce soon that they have acquired the July-to-November package of Nascar races that has been carried by NBC and TNT since 2001, said executives involved in the talks who insisted on anonymity because the contract had not been completed. The six-year ESPN-ABC deal is worth an estimated $280 million annually and will last through 2012, the executives said.

2005-09-20	Back to School for Mr. Butkus As a Coach for a TV Show	Dick Butkus -- the model of the furious, ferocious middle linebacker, the former Chicago Bear who once smashed footballs and bodily fluids out of unsuspecting running backs -- was grumbling. He was muttering. Who would want to annoy this guy? These teenagers, players on loan to him, were irritating him by missing assignments and failing to play hard enough. It was enough to make the bristles of his crew cut revolt. These youngsters were not doing their jobs. ''We've got no depth,'' he said. ''We're small, but we're slow.''
2005-09-15	ESPN Increases Budget In a Deal With Baseball	ESPN announced yesterday that it would televise Major League Baseball games through 2013 and expand its rights to carry games on new technologies, including a cellphone that it is expected to start marketing next year. The deal, which is worth about $2.4 billion to Major League Baseball over eight years, is a symbol of the sport's growing business success despite concerns about steroid use by players that have prompted Congressional hearings and threats of federal action. Earlier this summer, Rafael Palmeiro of the Baltimore Orioles tested positive for using a steroid months after wagging his finger and telling a Congressional committee that he never had.
2005-08-19	Cable Company's Ambition for a Network Proves a Salvation for the N.H.L.	There was a time through the spring and summer when Gary B. Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League, looked like a man without a neutron of leverage to his cable television negotiations. ESPN had just said that the N.H.L.'s rights were not worth much -- certainly not $60 million, the sum that ESPN on Wednesday rejected paying for the coming season by not exercising its option to do so. As he looked at what seemed like a bleak, post-lockout terrain, where no network should knock itself by bidding a cent for N.H.L. rights, Bettman said he set a $60 million floor for bidders. How rosy! How outlandish!
2005-08-18	ESPN Passes on N.H.L. Television Rights, Ending 21-Year Relationship With League	OLN won the cable television rights to the post-lockout National Hockey League yesterday after ESPN declined to match a surprisingly lucrative offer. OLN will carry games on Mondays and Tuesdays and will pay $65 million this season, $70 million in 2006-7 and $72.5 million in the third season, which is at the option of OLN and its owner, Comcast. The contract could extend for three more seasons, also at OLN and Comcast's option. With 21.4 million subscribers, Comcast is the largest cable operator in the United States and owns several cable networks.
2005-08-12	Though Pursued by ESPN, Nantz Remains Loyal to CBS	The untold story of the shift of ''Monday Night Football'' to ESPN from ABC next season is how much ESPN wanted to hire CBS's Jim Nantz. Until now, the tale stayed quiet because as soon as ABC lost the rights to ''Monday Night Football'' in mid-April, speculation focused on where John Madden and Al Michaels would go. Would they go as a pair to ESPN or to NBC Universal Sports when it starts ''Sunday Night Football'' next year?
2005-08-09	Coming Soon to ESPN: Bob Knight, Reality Star	Texas Tech Coach Bob Knight's credentials as a reality television star were established well before survivors started voting one another off islands, Paris Hilton moved in with barnyard animals and Donald Trump turned elaborately engineered hair into a corporate asset. Knight is loud, successful, demanding, profane and temperamental -- just the type of alpha male who would rile his housemates in ''Big Brother.'' He makes funny faces, is known to have tossed a chair and was seen on videotape choking one of his players, Neil Reed, during practice in 1997.
2005-08-07	At X Games, the Vertical-Ramp Veterans Rule the Skateboarding Skies	Shaun White, 18, had won the silver medal in the skateboard vert event at the X Games, and he was describing what it is like to ride against competitors who are mostly 10 years older. ''It will get you a little hazing, for sure,'' he said. White, who is a professional snowboarder with seven Winter X Games medals, won his first Summer X Games medal Friday night with a hard-charging opening run that included a body varial front side 540, a new trick that only he has executed.
2005-08-03	Comcast Will Not Engage in Fray With ESPN	Comcast, the giant cable company, has no intention of challenging ESPN by creating a competitive national sports channel, two Comcast executives said yesterday. There has been industry speculation for more than a year that Comcast may develop a network if it acquires a new package of eight late-season National Football League games on Thursday and Saturday nights.
2005-07-31	ESPN's New Master of the Offensive Foul	IF you're a sports fan -- more specifically, a basketball fan -- you may already find it hard to avoid Stephen A. Smith. He is the emerging face of hoops talk at ESPN, a fierce, confident, at times bombastic presence whose brash, clamorous style not only punctuates his reporting and analysis but sometimes eclipses them. In less than two years at the sports media empire, the lean, goateed Mr. Smith has become one of its best-known personalities, and arguably its most renowned African-American. He may not be as well known as ESPN lifers like Chris Berman, Dick Vitale or Dan Patrick, but he makes more noise, issuing emotional, emphatic riffs about coaches, players and owners. So much noise, in fact, that he has earned the nickname Screamin' A. Smith.
2005-07-27	Michaels Joins ESPN's 'Monday Night'	Al Michaels will stay with ''Monday Night Football'' when it leaves ABC Sports for ESPN in 2006 in an eight-year deal announced yesterday. ''I'm a creature of 'Monday Night,''' Michaels, the play-by-play announcer of the series since 1986, said during a conference call. ''I've said this before, but those words are just exhilarating to me: 'Monday Night Football.'''
2005-06-06	Media Talk; You've Seen the Network. Now Buy the Television.	ESPN, like Crest toothpaste, has capitalized on its own popularity with a line of brand-extended merchandise. Now the company that is synonymous with sports may place its name on television sets as well as television events. At the Consumer Electronics Show last January, ESPN met with major consumer electronics manufacturers, looking for a source of ESPN-branded TV's.
2005-06-01	ESPN Opts to Cut Bait and Not Fish With N.H.L.	ESPN is contemplating a future without National Hockey League coverage, three days after it refused to exercise an option to pay $60 million to carry the 2005-6 season. Mark Shapiro, an executive vice president of ESPN, said during a conference call yesterday that the only deal that made sense was one in which ESPN would not pay the league a guaranteed, upfront rights fee.
2005-05-29	ESPN Declines N.H.L. Option; New Deal Is Possible	ESPN has declined its option to carry the National Hockey League for $60 million next season, a move that had been widely expected because of the continuing lockout that caused the cancellation the 2004-5 season. ESPN has until Wednesday to change its mind. The two sides could try to negotiate a new deal over the next few days.
2005-05-17	TNT Knows Success With N.B.A. Ratings	TNT and ESPN are not often thought of as sports rivals. They carry sports, but TNT bills itself as the network that knows drama, and ESPN promotes itself as the worldwide leader in sports. So it is a victory of sorts for TNT that in the three seasons since ESPN has carried the National Basketball Association, TNT usually garners higher ratings.
2005-05-09	MediaTalk; ABC's Morning Show Is Adding a Co-Host	Robin Roberts, the news reader on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC since 2002, is getting new responsibilities on the program. The network is expected to announce today that she is being made a co-host of the program, which gives her a rank (and duties) equal to that of Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, who have been the hosts since early 1999. The promotion of Ms. Roberts was described yesterday by two people who had been briefed on it but who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose it.
2005-05-03	ESPN Has the Leverage On Carrying the N.H.L.	The National Hockey League, still without a labor agreement for the 2005-6 season, is also without a commitment by ESPN to carry its games. Not that the league has much influence on ESPN's decision on whether to pick up an option to pay $60 million by June 1 for the rights to carry games next season. What little leverage the N.H.L. had evaporated when it canceled the 2004-5 season.
2005-04-30	ESPN to Carry Breeders' Cup, Ending 22-Year Run at NBC	ESPN said yesterday that it would televise the Breeders' Cup championships for eight years starting in 2006, ending a 22-year run on NBC, where the event originated. NBC chose not to bid on the eight-race thoroughbred extravaganza, whose ratings have faltered. The expanded seven-hour Breeders' Cup telecast fits into ESPN's growing appetite for horse racing, said Mark Shapiro, the network's executive vice president for programming and production. ''We're fans of horse racing,'' Shapiro said during a conference call. ''We carry over 130 hours of horse racing. The Breeders' Cup is an evolutionary step, a monster product, seven hours of Super-Bowl-like racing moving to ESPN.''
2005-04-20	NBC Decides It Can't Live Without Football	Once again, the television networks have learned the hard way that they need football perhaps more than football needs them. After watching its ratings among young men fall, NBC has decided to pay to get back into the game, agreeing to spend $600 million a year starting with the 2006-7 season to carry a package of Sunday night National Football League games that had been on ESPN. In doing so, NBC hopes to reclaim a valuable audience. ABC will no longer carry football on Monday night, ceding it to ESPN, a Walt Disney Company sibling. Media agency executives said ABC appeared to be focusing on shows that appealed more to women and families.
2005-04-19	Monday Nights Are Changing: N.F.L. Off ABC	ABC Sports, which started ''Monday Night Football'' in 1970 and turned it into a highly rated marquee program, will cede the series after the coming season to ESPN, which will pay a record $1.1 billion a year. As one network stalwart leaves, another will return: NBC, which bowed out of broadcasting the National Football League after the 1997 season, will replace ESPN on the Sunday night games, paying $600 million annually, the same as ESPN has been paying.
2005-04-14	N.F.L. Releases Schedule And Makes a Show of It	It is a schedule, a list of dates, a compendium of 256 games, perhaps more compelling than the telephone book, but is it worth two hours of television time? Once upon a time, through 2003, the National Football League issued its schedule by fax or on its Web site. The league for many years was not that far from devising its schedule on the pigskin equivalent of an abacus.
2005-04-07	Musical 'Monday Night' For ABC and ESPN	The National Football League usually announces its gaudy television deals in one cymbal-crashing day. Last Nov. 8, it completed deals with CBS and Fox to renew their Sunday afternoon packages through 2011. The total value was $8 billion. At the same time, the league increased its annual take from DirecTV by 75 percent when they extended their deal for $3.5 billion over five years.
2005-03-31	A Way for Online Fans to Start Some of the Most Animated Arguments in Sports	Sports fans have long drawn on exclamation points, emoticons and the Caps Lock key to express themselves on Internet message boards. Now they can get a little more personal. A new application at espn.com lets fans record opinionated messages and create talking avatars to speak the words. ''It's kind of 'talk radio meets the Internet,''' said John Papanek, editorial director of ESPN new media. ''Everybody can say what they think, all at the same time.''
2005-03-16	ESPN and Sports Illustrated Ready to Publish in Spanish	Two of the nation's biggest sports magazines, Sports Illustrated and ESPN The Magazine, are both going after Hispanic sports fans with new publications. ESPN The Magazine, which has a circulation of 1.8 million, is joining forces with Editorial Televisa to publish a monthly Spanish-language edition of ESPN The Magazine, called ESPN Deportes.
2005-03-14	Ante Up at Dear Old Princeton: Online Poker as a College Major	For Michael Sandberg, it started a few years ago with nickel-and-dime games among friends. But last fall, he says, it became the source of a six-figure income and an alternative to law school. Mr. Sandberg, 22, of Alexandria, Va., mostly splits his time between Princeton University, where he is a senior and a politics major, and Atlantic City, where he plays high-stakes poker in his black hooded sweatshirt and dark aviator shades.
2005-02-22	Picture Is Fuzzy for N.H.L. on Networks	The National Hockey League has more things to fret about than television contracts -- like its very future after canceling the season -- but league officials could not have enjoyed hearing what their cable partner, ESPN, said last week. Mark Shapiro, an executive vice president of ESPN, threw off his gloves and criticized the N.H.L.'s rules, lack of scoring, resistance to letting players wear microphones and resistance to allowing arenas to be equipped with the overhead SkyCam. ''Everybody, like us, should be less focused on when they're coming back, but more on why nobody seems to care,'' Shapiro said.
2005-02-05	TV Talks Continue With ABC And ESPN	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said yesterday that discussions were continuing in efforts to renew television deals with Walt Disney's ABC and ESPN, which televise Monday and Sunday night football. ''We have a disagreement about what the right fees should be,'' Tagliabue said at his Super Bowl news conference, ''based not on wishful thinking but based on what we think the rights fees would be in the marketplace as it is, with tremendous interest in N.F.L. football.''
2005-01-24	More Armchair Quarterbacks	Sports video games counted for four out of the top 10 sellers in 2004, and two of those carry the ESPN brand. Can ''Sportcenter: The Game'' be far behind? Under a new 15-year agreement signed last week by Electronic Arts, the games publisher now has the exclusive right to use the sports channels mark in games. (Until now, Sega has published ESPN's games.)
2005-01-20	Trying to Show Games While the N.H.L. Remains Dark	John Davidson was in Vancouver last night coaching one team of top prospects in the Canadian Hockey League against another squad of 17-year-olds coached by Don Cherry. Normally, Davidson would be calling a Rangers game for the MSG Network, but, of course, the National Hockey League is in the fourth month of a lockout. ''It just doesn't seem right,'' Davidson said in a telephone interview. He has been skiing in Western Canada, doing some radio and television commentary and watching tapes of European hockey to while away his time.
2005-01-18	Electronic Arts And ESPN Sign 15-Year Deal To Sell Games	Electronic Arts, hoping to shore up its eroding dominance in the sports video game market, said yesterday that it had signed a 15-year deal giving it the exclusive right to use the ESPN brand in games. Under the agreement, Electronic Arts, the largest independent video game publisher, will pay $750 million to $850 million for the right to use the ESPN brand for games based on at least nine sports, including baseball, basketball and football, according to people briefed on the contract's terms. Some of that money will pay for commercials promoting the games on ESPN channels, they said.
2005-01-16	Doubling Up, On 'Tilt'	THE game of poker has become a creature of television over the last few years, and people are pulling up to the table in droves. Whether it's ''The World Series of Poker'' on ESPN or ''World Poker Tour'' on the Travel Channel or even ''Celebrity Poker Showdown'' on Bravo, viewers cannot channel-surf for more than a few seconds without coming across a scrum of players hunkered down over felt and chips. The current televised face of poker shows moneyed players going ''all in'' with a flourish in brightly lighted rooms. But there is a back story that is rarely referenced. In big-stakes poker, ad hoc alliances are formed, deals are cut, and the game is played out against a complicated backdrop that is always trying to cut a corner on the odds. Poker may have stopped rattling around alleys and lesser parts of town, but there is increasing chatter on the Web and elsewhere that suggests backstage bankrolling among players, leading to dramatic finishes played mostly for the cameras.
2005-01-13	Poker Itself Is the Winner, Along With the Grifters	God does not play dice with the universe, but Universal Studios is playing God with the dice. Gambling, and especially poker, has invaded almost every form of television. ''Las Vegas,'' the NBC drama about a Nevada casino, is just the prime-time tip of the iceberg. Celebrity poker, championship poker and casino-based reality shows abound on cable and broadcast networks. (A&E's ''Caesar's 24/7'' began this week, picking up where Fox's reality show ''Casino'' left off.)
2005-01-13	Don King Sues ESPN Over 'SportsCentury'	Don King filed suit in a state court in Florida yesterday, saying that an ESPN ''SportsCentury'' program last May defamed him by calling him a ''snake-oil salesman'' and ''shameless'' huckster who underpaid Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes, threatened to break Holmes's legs, and ''killed not once, but twice.'' King's role in a 1954 shooting was ruled a justifiable homicide, but he served nearly four years in prison for a first-degree manslaughter conviction in 1967.
2004-12-10	A First Love Becomes The Family Business	Actors with quintessentially Republican faces -- hard-bitten frontier, or touched with beatitude, or both -- will no doubt be in demand in the coming years, whenever Hollywood tries, as it periodically does, to entertain the Americans that clearly dominate the electorate. Actors like Chris Cooper, Kevin Bacon and James Woods are the hard-bitten types; Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, Jeff Bridges fall into the second category. On ESPN tomorrow night, a whole gang of Republican-faced men have been brought together for ''3,'' a movie about Dale Earnhardt and Nascar, that hallowed regular-Joe pastime and the word liberals now use to berate themselves, as those two syllables seem proof to some that they'll never understand the first thing about America.
2004-10-31	Poker Faces, and They Haven't Started Shaving	The table was antique mahogany. The chips were casino-quality clay in a gleaming, Bond-like steel carrying case. The game was, of course, No Limit Texas Hold 'Em, except for the players who had already lost their buy-in and joined the poker and dice games in another room. Records of earnings and losses for the 15 regulars and 7 occasional players were kept on an Excel spreadsheet on one of the organizers' computers. After 11 p.m. or so, the winners pocketed their cash. The players snacked on popcorn and whatever else they could forage from the kitchen, argued amiably about who was the biggest poker addict, and then ran into the backyard, where the floodlights allowed for a high-energy game of midnight football, the perfect way for a group of ninth graders to end an evening out.
2004-10-12	Networks in a Duel of Technology	Suddenly there was a flame where none had existed. Until last week, fire had not been on intimate terms with sports TV graphics. But there it was flickering from the pitch-speed segment of the FoxBar during last week's league division series. It looked as if the pilot light in Fox's glowing puck (born 1996; died 1998) had been reignited to provide a quick flash of blazing garnish to very fast pitches. Imagine the video conflagration possibility if Fox carried a postseason matchup between Randy Johnson and Roger Clemens.
2004-10-06	Life Among the Yankees in King George's Court	The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty The Game, the Team and the Cost of Greatness By Buster Olney Illustrated. 346 pages. Ecco/HarperCollins. $26.95. As he begins his chronicle of the last phase (for now) of Yankee hegemony over Major League Baseball, Buster Olney lays out a clinical case of what the British call ''control freakery.'' The team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner, is on the rampage, attacking his general manager, striking fear in the clubhouse attendants (even while they are urinating), lighting into hapless vendors for peddling stale pretzels. His Steinbrenner is not just a tyrant but a Cassandra, panicking in the early innings of key games, perpetually predicting imminent catastrophe, planning overhauls long before his team has had its last licks. In fact, in his bedrock belief that whatever can go wrong will, Steinbrenner seems to own the wrong team. He really should be running the Boston Red Sox.
2004-09-11	Changing Guard at Disney Means Finding New Vision	Can Disney be Disney without Michael? When Michael D. Eisner exits the Walt Disney Company in two years, the chief executive will leave behind a corporation marked indelibly by a personal style that hewed closely to the founder Walt Disney's hands-on management style and bent for family entertainment, even as he vastly expanded the company's reach.
2004-09-10	Rose Film Does Little To Promote the Game	In every way, it appears that Major League Baseball endorsed -- or did not stand in the way of -- the making of ESPN's new docudrama ''Hustle,'' about the three years leading to Pete Rose's banishment by Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, who died within days of his ruling in 1989. The film, which will have its premiere on Sept. 25, is far from a love note to baseball. As directed by Peter Bogdanovich (''The Last Picture Show'' and ''Paper Moon''), there is little baseball action. But there are scenes showing Rose, as the Reds' manager, in the clubhouse planning his bets and in the dugout, ignoring the game to seek out his accomplice Paul Janszen's hand signals that told him how his wagers were faring.
2004-09-08	New ESPN Network Just for College Sports	ESPN announced yesterday that it would start a 24-hour college sports channel in March, prompting the fledgling CSTV network to accuse ESPN of copying its concept. Brian Bedol, the president of College Sports Television, mocked ESPN, calling it in a statement, ''the worldwide follower in sports.''
2004-09-07	At ESPN After 25 Years, Happy Birthday to Us	ESPN's song of itself, a four-month bacchanalia of self-promotion for its 25th anniversary, finally ended last night with the coda to a 32-hour birthday party that seemed to begin when Uncle Miltie was a pup. The full Bristol Choir -- Big Chris and the Bermanettes -- has thundered out ESPN: the Epoch, a Ring Cycle that, in the guise of celebrating the fan, looked back at what mattered during the past quarter-century, and not a moment too soon, since ESPN's blessed birth on Sept. 7, 1979.
2004-08-29	Is It a Bird? Or a Plane? No, It's Just a Reality Show	A stunt for a new ESPN game show that had contestants hanging from a blimp 500 feet over Long Island Sound in the Stratford area last Monday may have surprised or confused some onlookers. But, as it turned out, the stunt had been cleared by the Federal Aviation Administration, an official from the agency said.
2004-08-23	Giants Unfazed By Theismann	The Giants' maligned offensive line took another hit Saturday, when, during the telecast of a preseason game between the Jets and the Colts, Joe Theismann of ESPN said the Giants had the league's worst offensive line. Theismann's comments caused only a mild reaction among players who, by now, seem used to criticism. ''I could say some things, but I won't,'' tackle Luke Petitgout said. ''I'll refrain. I don't really care what he has to say. He was a great player back in his day. We're getting better. We're going to be there this year. It's a work in progress with a sense of urgency.''
2004-07-10	Matsui's Actions Belie Trump's Harsh Words	At various stages of this season, Kazuo Matsui has changed his swing, his throwing motion and his place in the lineup. The Mets gave him a pair of prescription goggles, a new batting coach and his first day off in more than 1,200 professional games. Manager Art Howe brought Matsui into his office for a series of pep talks. Coaches spent extra time with him before games. Teammates bowed in his direction to encourage him. No matter what they tried, the Mets could not solve the mystery of Matsui.
2004-06-29	NO COMMENT FROM ESPN	As conference officials are contacted by the Justice Department, which recently opened an antitrust inquiry into ESPN's practices in acquiring college football and basketball programming, the network continued to have no comment. One conference commissioner, Mike Slive, of the Southeastern Conference, said in a statement, ''I don't think it's appropriate to comment on what appears to be a continuing investigation.''
2004-06-27	Antitrust Inquiry Focuses on ESPN's Practices	The Justice Department's antitrust division has opened an inquiry into how ESPN acquires and uses its college football and basketball programming, two television industry executives said. A lawyer for the antitrust division has begun to contact the athletic conferences, one of the executives said.
2004-06-08	ESPN Looks Back, But Not at Itself	To watch ''Then and Now'' you would come away thinking that ESPN played a passive role in the growth of sports during the past 25 years. Who's slighting ESPN here? ESPN, which rarely refuses the chance to produce advertisements for itself. But the evidence is in: ESPN is extremely modest here and rarely explains itself during the two-hour program (tonight at 7 p.m.), which kicks off a 14-week retrospect on the past quarter-century in sports since the unremarkable dawn of ESPN in September 1979.
2004-05-23	N.B.A.'s New Universe Rotates Around Cable	The next time ABC Sports broadcasts an N.B.A. game, it will be Game 1 of the finals, on June 6. Though hardly winded, ABC will rest during the conference finals (it did two games last year), as it will for the next four years during what is probably the best part of the playoffs. ESPN and TNT have taken over. ABC hardly makes the ripple that NBC Sports did for a dozen years through the 2002 finals.
2004-05-20	The N.H.L. And NBC Skate as Pair	The National Hockey League's labor situation is uncertain, but its television future is settled. On cable, it will stay with ESPN for far less money, and on broadcast, it is moving to NBC for no upfront money. The league agreed last night to a three-year deal with ESPN worth $60 million next season and $70 million for each of the next two years.
2004-05-12	A.C.C. to Announce New TV Deal	The reconfigured Atlantic Coast Conference, which will add Miami and Virginia Tech from the Big East next season, will announce a new seven-year football television contract with ESPN and ABC Sports today that is worth $258 million, an industry executive said. The deal also calls for the A.C.C. to hold a title game in 2005, when Boston College, also from the Big East, will join to make it a 12-team conference. In the first year of the deal, each team will receive about $2.5 million, with the annual fee escalating to more than $3 million by 2010, the final year. The teams will also divide the payment from the championship game, which is estimated to be worth about $6 million in 2005. The contract replaces one with ESPN and ABC that was to expire after the 2004 season.
2004-04-28	In This Fish Story, the Money Keeps Getting Bigger	Like many athletes, Michael Iaconelli likes to celebrate. But when he pumps his fist and points at the television cameras, he is usually brandishing a hefty large-mouth bass and standing on the deck of his customized boat. Iaconelli, 31, is one of the rising stars on the Bassmaster Tour, a professional bass-fishing circuit that started in 1968 and has grown significantly over the last few years.
2004-04-23	The One Constant in the N.F.L. Draft Is ESPN	Is it the National Football League draft or ESPN's N.F.L. draft? Is the league simply a character in the ESPN empire -- James Bond to MGM, Roger Rabbit in Toontown? Commissioner Paul Tagliabue appears at regular intervals with a jersey, a smile and a draft pick to establish league involvement. But the constant faces tomorrow at noon Eastern time and Sunday at 11 a.m. will be the ESPN troops in Madison Square Garden, Bristol, Conn., the ''Cold Pizza'' studio and the draft headquarters of each team. It's ESPN's television-radio-magazine-Internet world, and we're just subscribers. Had the N.F.L. not voiced its displeasure with ESPN's ''Playmakers'' series (too fantastical for some, too real for others), the Cougars would be the 33rd team on the clock, and Mel Kiper Jr. would speculate about whether Eli Manning should be chosen as insurance for the arm-weary, fictional quarterback Derek McConnell. By videoconference from New Orleans before the first pick, Archie Manning would demand that his son not play for a heartless, one-dimensional team.
2004-04-18	Go Team, Go Figure	Nimrod Gear Years ago, as a reporter for a small newspaper in central Texas, my beat included a little town called Hutto, whose high-school sports teams were known as the Hippos; the girls' teams were called the Lady Hippos. That seemed to me the most unfortunate nickname I was likely to encounter. But this was before I heard of the Nimrods. Lately, a lot of people have heard of the Nimrods, of Watersmeet Township School in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, but that nickname has turned out to be anything but unfortunate: it has helped move about $80,000 worth of Nimrod gear in about two months, to buyers all over the United States, and attracted interest from some of the biggest sports-apparel companies. Pretty impressive for a high school with 77 students. Among other things, the story of the Nimrods provides one answer to an often asked question: Does television advertising really work? It was through a series of TV spots that the Nimrod brand broke -- albeit a series of ads for something else. ESPN, the sports megabrand whose properties include cable channels and a popular magazine, featured the Watersmeet Nimrods in a campaign built around the theme ''Without sports . . . ,'' which aims to underscore how much athletic competition and fandom mean in American life. Three ads, which were broadcast starting in late January, introduced viewers to the scrappy Michigan basketball squad and its supporters and asked, ''Without sports, who would cheer for the Nimrods?''
2004-04-09	Winner in Mock Trial	The Yankees were cleared by an ESPN jury of upsetting baseball's competitive balance with their free spending in a mock trial taped Wednesday and shown last night as ''Break Up the Bombers: The Yankees on Trial.'' The jury voted, 10 to 2, in the Yankees' favor. ''We're happy when someone doesn't proclaim that we're bad for baseball,'' said Rick Cerrone, a spokesman for the Yankees, but he added that the positive verdict ''isn't relevant to our disappointment in ESPN for doing this on the day of our home opener.''
2004-04-08	Yankees Trial Is Law Lite, an Unreal Stab at Reality TV	It was legal silliness, to be sure, ESPN's mock trial yesterday of the Yankees on charges of tilting baseball's competitive balance, which will be shown tonight. There was no indictment -- had there been one, it would have been one charge of guilt by profligacy -- no grand jury, no voir dire of the jurors, no voluminous charge to the jury by ESPN Superior Court Judge Catherine Crier (once a real judge, now a Court TV host). No defendant sat beside Bruce Cutler, once John Gotti's lawyer, whose defense by adoration of the Yankees would have made George Steinbrenner kvell. It was a barroom argument without beer or legal briefs. It was Cutler v. the mock prosecutor Alan Dershowitz, the Yankees v. the Red Sox. But Dershowitz, defender of Claus von Bulow and an avowed Yankees loather, ceded that his beloved Red Sox were nearly as overprivileged as the Yanks.
2004-04-01	Yanks on Deck And in the Dock: The Verdict Is . . .	ESPN is putting the Yankees' free-spending ways on trial next week, and Bruce Cutler, once John Gotti's defense lawyer, said yesterday that he is ''wielding the cudgel'' for George Steinbrenner, himself a powerful cudgel-wielder. Alan Dershowitz said from Australia that prosecuting the case against a $183 million payroll ''is a dream argument'' because the Yankees have ''ruined my life,'' first as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan and now as a Boston Red Sox lover.
2004-03-09	Ratings and Labor Woes Cloud N.H.L.'s TV Talks	The National Hockey League's immediate future is uncertain, with the possibility of a work stoppage next season. But one thing is virtually certain: the league will not duplicate its five-year, $600 million deal with ESPN and ABC, which expires after this season. The average annual payment of $120 million was always excessive, the product of Disney's ESPN and ABC networks bidding against themselves. The league had to feel like the luckiest sports organization alive because of ESPN's desire to corner the market on the N.H.L. and to keep building the younger ESPN2 through hockey.
2004-03-06	'Dream Job,' the Nightmare, Showing Now on ESPN	ESPN's ''Dream Job'' lacks the essentials of the reality genre: contrived love, grotesque physical tasks, naked Machiavellians, exotic locales, obnoxious fiancés and Donald Trump's cantilevered coif. There are no million-dollar prizes or lavish weddings awaiting the victor. So what's left for ''Dream Job'' without the forces of venality, duplicity, cupidity and hostility?
2004-02-25	ESPN Says It Will Do Film on Rose's Issues	The period of Pete Rose's gambling that led to his banishment from Major League Baseball will be the focus of an ESPN film that is scheduled to be shown in September, the network announced yesterday. ''If you look at the timeline of Pete Rose, any time there's a chance of someone batting .400, his name comes up,'' said Mark Shapiro, the executive vice president of ESPN. ''Whenever there's talk of a hitting streak, he comes up again. The Hall of Fame argument comes up anew every few months, and then there was the book. After so many touchstones, we should capitalize on the growing interest.''
2004-02-24	New Murdoch Network Could Challenge ESPN	Rupert Murdoch wants to take on ESPN -- again -- with his own national sports cable network. An industry publication reported yesterday that Murdoch is in preliminary discussions with cable operators and the National Football League to create a new network.
2004-02-20	A Showdown Approaches in the Battle for Disney	As the Walt Disney Company's crucial annual meeting draws closer, the campaign over the future of the company, including an effort to oust Michael D. Eisner, its chief executive, is generating enough heat to rival the presidential race. Disney's president, Robert A. Iger, who rarely gives interviews, said on CNBC on Thursday that despite last week's unsolicited offer from the Comcast Corporation, there was no ''for sale'' sign on his company's door. Mr. Eisner is scheduled to appear on ''Larry King Live'' on Friday and will visit investors on a sweep through Northern California next week.
2004-02-12	Cable Giant Bids to Take Over Disney	In an audacious bid that could once again reshape the entertainment landscape, the Comcast Corporation, the largest cable operator in the United States, made an unsolicited $54.1 billion takeover offer yesterday for the Walt Disney Company. If successful, the deal would create the largest media company in the world, leaping past Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation by combining Comcast's distribution channel to over 21 million cable subscribers with Disney's collection of film and television properties. Disney's holdings include the ABC television network, ESPN and other cable networks, the Disney and Miramax movie studios, and Disney theme parks around the world.
2004-02-05	Citing N.F.L., ESPN Cancels 'Playmakers'	ESPN's ''Playmakers'' series, which offended the National Football League with its frequently harsh characterization of professional football, was canceled yesterday by the network after one season. The 11-week dramatic series examined subjects like drugs and sex on the fictional Cougars team without ever mentioning the words ''National Football League.'' Early on, the series prompted Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, to complain to Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN's parent company. Soon after Tagliabue's call to Eisner, ESPN stopped showing promotional commercials for the series during its Sunday night N.F.L. broadcasts.
2004-02-05	Big East's Defections Send Recruit Elsewhere	He wore a baseball cap and his shirt was untucked and he joked about how his mother had been asking him to clean up his room. Brian Toal might have looked and acted like another high school student, but the surroundings, his entourage and the 30 Rutgers fans staring longingly at him from the other side of a glass window at the ESPN Zone said otherwise. He was not any other teenager or even any other hotshot college football prospect. He was, until 4:45 yesterday afternoon, officially uncommitted. Everyone loves a top prospect. Everyone really loves one who has yet to announce where he is headed next season. Yesterday was national signing day, the occasion when most high school players sign their letters of intent to play for the university they chose. Toal could have simply made a phone call or sent a fax. It just would not have been this much fun.
2004-01-02	Sports of The Times; Trojans Give B.C.S. Another Headache	A GIGANTIC cardinal-and-gold elephant has hunkered down in the musty laboratory of the Bowl Championship Series. The pachyderm has claimed squatter's rights and bragging rights, all kinds of rights, and is not going away any time soon. The University of Southern California did the worst thing possible for the intricate but rather imperfect formula for producing a national football champion. It walloped a very good Michigan team, 28-14, yesterday in the Rose Bowl to cast a huge shadow, a veritable eclipse, on the festivities in New Orleans on Sunday.
2003-12-26	Sports of The Times; In Sports World, It's Hard to Forgive Behavior and Actions of Some People	IN the pages of The New York Times some 35 years ago, the celebrated political columnist James Reston wrote about Joe Namath, then the star quarterback for the Jets, who offered a ''guarantee'' that his team would beat the heavily favored Baltimore Colts in the 1969 Super Bowl. The Jets stunningly made good on the promise, and Namath was making great strides to attain folklore status in this country. ''Joe Namath is one of the most interesting symbols of America,'' Reston wrote. ''Joe is not only in tune with the rebellious attitude of the young, but he doubles it. He defies both the people who hate the playboys and the people who hate the bully boys. He is something special: a long-haired hard hat, the antihero of the sports world.''
2003-12-23	Namath to Offer Apology For Bizarre ESPN Interview	The Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath will apologize to the ESPN sideline reporter Suzy Kolber for his bizarre behavior during an interview Saturday night, the Jets spokesman Ron Colangelo said. Namath and Kolber were both traveling yesterday, but Namath plans to call her, Colangelo said. Namath, slurring his words during rambling statements, twice told Kolber on camera that he wanted to kiss her, leaning in close to her at one point. In a statement Sunday, ESPN said that the interview was cut short because of Namath's demeanor and that it would not have conducted the interview if it had anticipated Namath's state. Namath was at the game as part of the Jets' celebration of their all-time team.
2003-12-02	This May Be a Shock, But Rodman Is Boring	In his halcyon days as a cross-dressing rebounder, Dennis Rodman could not have asked for a better forum to exhibit himself than a two-hour reality series on ESPN. Now in pursuit of a comeback, Rodman has received that platform, from ESPN, but it is too late. Rodman is boring. The bizarre, cartoonish spirit that animated him has deflated. ''The Season: Rodman on the Rebound'' (Part 1 will be broadcast tonight at midnight Eastern; Part 2 tomorrow at the same time) is a chronicle of self-delusion. He believes he can return to play in the N.B.A., that he can ''finish my career the way I wanted to.'' He suggests that a job and fan adoration will ensue if he can grab 13 or 14 rebounds a game.
2003-11-27	Cable Network Unearths Classic Tie From the 60's	On Nov. 19, 1966, Notre Dame and Michigan State played to a 10-10 tie, a game remembered for the matchup of the top two college football teams in the nation and for the conservative play-calling of Ara Parseghian, the coach of the Fighting Irish, at the end. The game was carried by ABC Sports at a time when college games were not on television nearly every day of the week and ABC was where you watched one game every Saturday.
2003-10-22	ARTS BRIEFING	HIGHLIGHTS PARIS: ACCOLADE AND ACRIMONY -- France's leading literary award, the Prix Goncourt, touched off a controversy over its timing when it was bestowed yesterday on Jacques-Pierre Amette for ''La Maîtresse de Brecht'' (''Brecht's Mistress''). The prizewinning novel tells of the Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht, his return to post-World War II East Berlin and an affair with an actress who influences his work. The announcement was termed ''deeply distressing'' by Regine Deforges, head of the jury of the rival Prix Femina, because it was not expected until Nov. 3, Agence France-Presse reported. The Prix Femina is to be announced on Monday, and Ms. Deforges contended that the Prix Goncourt broke a three-year-old agreement under which the juries would take turns in revealing their winners. Edmonde Charles-Roux, president of the Goncourt jury, said its announcement was made early because this year is the centennial of the award.
2003-10-08	Baseball Draws Big Numbers	Fox, ESPN and ESPN2 set viewership records for Major League Baseball's division series, led by Fox's average of 11.2 million viewers for its five games. The high points for Fox were Game 5 of the Cubs-Braves series Sunday, which attracted a record 15.4 million viewers, and Game 5 of the Red Sox-A's series Monday, which was seen by 13 million viewers.
2003-10-06	ESPN Responds, but Its Leaders Hide	It was an extraordinary joint mea culpa, the four remaining panelists of ESPN's ''Sunday N.F.L. Countdown'' offering their regrets yesterday for failing to comment last Sunday on Rush Limbaugh's absurd contention that the news media wanted Donovan McNabb to succeed because he is black. ''I'm angry for the hurt it's caused African-Americans,'' the host Chris Berman said. ''I'm angry for the hurt it's caused all people. I've never looked at Donovan McNabb as a black quarterback. Ever.''
2003-10-06	Sports Fan Is the Prize, Or the Victim, In Cable Fight	Miami and West Virginia were tied 10-10 in the third quarter of their college football game Thursday night, and many eyes in the crowd at the Draft House Sports Cafe in Phoenix were trained on a big television set tuned to ESPN, the only channel showing the game. Most were blissfully unaware of a business dispute that is threatening to keep many televised sports events from fans in Phoenix, as well as in San Diego, New Orleans, Cleveland and other cities served by Cox Cable, the fourth-largest cable company in the country.
2003-10-04	Within Bounds	With his comment about Donovan McNabb, a quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, Rush Limbaugh has become the latest figure banished to the corner for being racist. ''The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback can do well,'' Limbaugh said Sunday on ESPN. By Wednesday he was gone from the network. But this time Limbaugh, of all people, has injected a bit of honesty into our public discourse about race. He may have been going off half-cocked, as is his wont, but he raises a valid point: America wants to see black people succeed, whether they need help or not, and that yearning -- with all its ambiguous and even adverse effects -- has become part of the warp and woof of our national consciousness.
2003-10-04	Rush Limbaugh, Race and Football	To the Editor: The saddest thing about this entire incident surrounding Rush Limbaugh's resigning from his ESPN job (''Not Ready for Prime Time,'' editorial, Oct. 3) is that Mr. Limbaugh does not believe that he did anything wrong. This was not about Mr. Limbaugh's right under the First Amendment to offer an opinion, as he stated at the National Association of Broadcasters' Convention. This was about Mr. Limbaugh's taking pleasure in denigrating individuals and groups in a most despicable manner and thinking that he could get away with it.
2003-10-03	Limbaugh Still Has a Fallback Position	Rush Limbaugh's opinions about race, the news media and a black quarterback led to his resignation Wednesday as an ESPN football analyst, but he is fortunate. He may never get a sports job again, but he can return to his millions of radio listeners who have heard tougher, more incendiary comments on his talk show than those he made Sunday about Donovan McNabb of the Philadelphia Eagles. He is luckier than others in the sports business who have made racially insensitive or misogynistic comments, and lost their careers. Jimmy (the Greek) Snyder, a CBS football analyst, and Al Campanis, a longtime Los Angeles Dodgers executive, made disparaging remarks about African-Americans in sports. Ben Wright, a CBS golf commentator, made remarks about the impact of lesbianism on women's golf.
2003-10-03	Not Ready for Prime Time	Breaking through the background chatter of television takes some doing. So ESPN apparently thought it might try something a little different. Instead of more sex, violence or even a nude sportscaster like the one who appeared on another sports show, ESPN brought in Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing radio commentator. He was there to give his hot-button views on one thing: football. And if the idea was to raise ratings, it worked. At least, it worked for one month. As any television pro could have warned ESPN, it turned out that Limbaugh was not ready for the big leagues. He stands more in the class of Jimmy (the Greek) Snyder, who made insensitive remarks about blacks, and Michael Savage, fired from MSNBC for wishing AIDS on a gay caller. On ESPN's ''Sunday N.F.L. Countdown'' this week, Limbaugh said the kind of thing that wins him legions of tub-thumping fans on radio but that understandably offends most other people.
2003-10-03	The Pushing and Pulling Of Black Quarterbacks	Each black quarterback in the National Football League at some point in his career has been encouraged to move from the position and use his athleticism at skilled spots like running back or wide receiver. Not one has failed to hear the cutting words that he is a better runner than he is a pure passer. Each one has faced his share of brutal jabs about reading defenses poorly, the inference being that black quarterbacks are not mentally up to the task. Not one of the seven black quarterbacks who will start N.F.L. games this weekend will say he has benefited from a push from the news media and a social concern intended to improve his chances of success.
2003-10-02	Limbaugh Resigns From ESPN's N.F.L. Show	Rush Limbaugh resigned last night from ESPN's ''Sunday NFL Countdown'' three days after he made race-related comments about how the news media view the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb. The remarks prompted demands for ESPN to fire Limbaugh yesterday by Gen. Wesley K. Clark, a Democratic presidential contender, and Rep. Harold Ford Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, who said that he had enlisted 20 other House Democrats and had interest from three Republicans to sign a letter to the ESPN protesting the radio commentator's comments.
2003-09-09	Limbaugh Thrives as an Outsider While Talking Football	If Rush Limbaugh talking football on ESPN's ''Sunday NFL Countdown'' seems the equivalent of Bill O'Reilly jumping bare out of Al Franken's birthday cake, think again. Tanned and trim (had he been to training camp?), Limbaugh brings a tart, arrogant outsider's viewpoint to a studio program designed for core pigskin fans and which, in past years, added the insiders Marty Schottenheimer and Bill Parcells. But those guys are coaching again and Limbaugh is creating a kind of functional discord from his perch 20 feet to the side of the main set, needling his playmates as if they were callers to his radio show. His chief role is to throw red Rush Challenge flags to opinions expressed by Tom Jackson, Steve Young and Michael Irvin, although he also offers a weekly essay. Think of George Will with such power!
2003-08-25	Miscellany	* ESPN, Bristol, Conn., will not show commercials during the premiere episode of its first scripted drama series, ''Playmakers,'' about a fictional football team. The episode, to run tomorrow, will be sponsored by Universal Pictures, Universal City, Calif., to promote ''The Rundown,'' a movie with Seann William Scott that is to be released on Sept. 26. There will be ''Brought to you by'' announcements before and after the episode as well as a trailer, two and a half minutes long, after the episode. ESPN is part of the Walt Disney Company , and Universal Pictures is part of Vivendi Universal.
2003-08-18	Little League Innocence Fades in TV Glare	Boys of summer sometimes cry. They just can't help it. Randy Keen would prefer that television not show such tender, private moments at the Little League World Series. The other day he even told his team from Tallmadge, Ohio, ''Try not to throw a bat or cry,'' because who knows how many of ESPN's 13 cameras would be trained on a 12-year-old's eyes.
2003-08-11	Pro Surfers Embrace a New Wave: Team Competition	On a scorching, windless afternoon, Kelly Slater, a six-time world champion, and a crew of seven other professional surfers from the East Coast bested a team of eight competitors from the West Coast today in the first ESPN X Games surfing event. To Slater, the X Games format, which fielded teams of the world's best surfers rather than the standard head-to-head competition, was ''a defining moment for the sport.''
2003-07-18	ESPN Showed It All, Except the Homers	Something was wrong on ESPN's telecast of the ''Home Run Derby'' on Monday. It wasn't that Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds were not there. It wasn't Chris Berman's silly nicknames (Albert ''Winnie the'' Pujols, Jim ''Mr.'' Edmonds), or the wind at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, which seemed unfriendly to home runs. It was something visual, something about the way ESPN was covering the homers. Something was off. It made me twitchy and upset the natural order of watching home runs.
2003-07-15	Limbaugh Added to ESPN's Grand Old Party	Rush Limbaugh's sportscasting career, stunted when Dennis Miller, and not he, was hired for ABC's ''Monday Night Football'' three years ago, was reborn yesterday when ESPN enlisted him to join Chris Berman, Tom Jackson, Steve Young, Michael Irvin and Chris Mortensen on ''Sunday NFL Countdown.'' There is not enough verbal airspace for Berman and Limbaugh at the same studio desk, which is why Limbaugh will sit at a separate perch (like the children's table at Thanksgiving dinner) from where he will offer essays and interrupt (with a buzzer, gong or ThunderStix) when he disagrees with the adults.
2003-07-10	Giving N.F.L. Fans More, More, More	For the National Football League, enough is not enough. Dominance on Sunday afternoons and Monday nights is not enough. The Super Bowl's placement as each year's highest-rated program is not enough. Nor is it enough for the N.F.L. to receive more money from broadcast and cable networks than any other sport. To achieve daily ubiquity, the league will, on Nov. 4, begin the NFL Network, a round-the-clock channel designed to feed fans unsated by existing coverage with news, analysis and programming from NFL Films.
2003-07-06	ESPN Adds Lavin To Broadcast Team	ESPN has hired the former U.C.L.A. coach Steve Lavin as a studio analyst for its college basketball coverage.
2003-07-04	Big East Contracts May Be Renegotiated	ABC and ESPN may try to renegotiate their television contracts with the Big East Conference now that the football powers Miami and Virginia Tech are leaving to join the Atlantic Coast Conference, marketing and TV consultants said. The networks, owned by the Walt Disney Company, are scheduled to pay about $15 million a year to broadcast Big East football and basketball games through 2007.
2003-06-06	HOCKEY: Game 5 TV Analysis; ABC and ESPN Script Grabs More Eyeballs	A well-constructed script for a made-for-TV drama in prime time might evolve like this: The first hour would provide frantic action and a little violent bloodshed. The second hour would add controversy and an increase in tension. The third hour would have decisive conflict resolution and offer the potential for a better sequel.
2003-06-06	First Pitch Delivered By ABC And ESPN	ABC and ESPN today offered a vision of the 2010 and 2012 Olympics that, if chosen as the winning bid by the International Olympic Committee, would expand coverage from their traditional prime-time and cable networks to the Internet, Disney theme parks and the ABC Family channel. The two networks, both owned by the Walt Disney Company, were the first to make a presentation for the media rights to the two Olympics, which could sell for a record $2 billion. The News Corporation's Fox and General Electric's NBC are scheduled to present their plans on Friday. When NBC finishes, all three conglomerates will submit bids at 2:30 p.m. Swiss time; the I.O.C. will start considering the offers 90 minutes later.
2003-05-22	A Legend Returns, His Fastball Intact	Curt Gowdy walked into the Fenway Park broadcast booth for the Yankees-Red Sox game tonight, not nervous, but a little concerned about calling play-by-play for the first time in more than 20 years. He had his stories, his memories of Ted Williams and Bob Gibson and Dom DiMaggio, but would that ability to match his voice to the plays in a seamless way return? Gowdy admitted that he had not exhausted himself with pregame preparation.
2003-05-13	The N.B.A. Playoffs on ABC: Getting Behind the Ratings	Each week, ABC Sports informs the world how much better its life is now that it broadcasts Sunday afternoon N.B.A. playoff games, which it can because ESPN, its cousin at the Walt Disney Company, buys the time. The numbers backing ABC's glee sound wonderful -- for ABC. The San Antonio-Los Angeles Lakers game on Sunday showed a 312 percent increase in its overnight Nielsen ratings over what ABC broadcast from 3:30 to 6 p.m. Eastern in 2002.
2003-05-02	Peculiar Choice to Handle Play-by-Play for the N.B.A.	When ABC and ESPN made Brad Nessler their No. 1 voice for N.B.A. games, they guessed that an announcer without pro basketball experience was a creditable choice. Anyone the two networks chose would have inevitably been compared with Marv Albert, which made Nessler, a veteran of college basketball and football, a peculiar -- and wrong -- selection. Albert could not be pried from his TNT contract, but ESPN and ABC rejected the chance to hire Mike Breen, the Knicks radio voice who is calling playoff games for TNT, or other talented local announcers, like Seattle's Kevin Calabro (heard now on NBA TV, the league's network).
2003-04-23	Fewer Viewers But More Money	The first weekend of the N.B.A. playoffs demonstrated that the league's increased emphasis on cable television in its new contract is not necessarily geared to increasing viewership. The league's six-year agreements with ESPN, ABC and TNT are worth $4.6 billion.
2003-04-14	Murdoch's First Step: Make the Sports Fan Pay	To understand why Rupert Murdoch is buying control of the satellite broadcaster DirecTV, ask fans of the Orlando Magic or the Minnesota Timberwolves. Mr. Murdoch's Fox cable networks have the local television rights to both basketball teams. When Time Warner Cable refused to pay the fees that Fox demanded to carry the channels this year, the company kept the games off cable for 10 weeks of the season. ''I'm a very big Magic fan,'' Shah Jamali, a local lawyer, said in an interview with The Orlando Sentinel. ''I was pretty much ready to switch to a satellite TV service to get my games back.''
2003-03-21	For a While, ESPN Gets The Show	For 21 years, CBS Sports' coverage of the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament was, naturally, on CBS. But yesterday afternoon, it was not. At about 11:40 a.m. Eastern time, Michael Aresco, a CBS Sports senior vice president, told Len DeLuca, an ESPN senior vice president and a former CBS executive, that it was ESPN's tournament, temporarily.
2003-03-20	TV Plans Are in Place	If news coverage requires CBS to pre-empt the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament today and tomorrow, the games will appear on ESPN and ESPN2 under an agreement reached last night and announced by ESPN. Games that ESPN and ESPN2 cannot show will be on TNN and TV Land. Until war in Iraq erupts, however, CBS will continue to show basketball. ''We will advise viewers if CBS is interrupted by news,'' said LeslieAnne Wade, a spokeswoman for CBS Sports.
2003-03-19	CBS-ESPN Deal Is Expected	CBS and ESPN are expected to announce a deal today under which ESPN and ESPN2 would carry the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament if news coverage of the war on CBS pre-empts the games. Mark Shapiro, an executive vice president of ESPN, declined yesterday to discuss the financial terms of the deal. ''The financial arrangement is not the driving force,'' Shapiro said.
2003-03-04	Katz Leaving ABC Sports	Howard Katz resigned as president of ABC Sports yesterday and will be replaced by George Bodenheimer, who will continue to be the president of ESPN. ''Over the last six months, I've felt this was inevitable, but I wanted to get through the Super Bowl,'' said Katz, whose tenure as president lasted four years.
2002-12-24	Another Parcells Smoke Screen	When NBC hired Bill Parcells in 1991, and when ESPN hired him this season, each must have believed that paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars as a studio analyst would give it an edge in reporting on his eventual flirtations with suitors who had vacant (or soon-to-be-emptied) coaching jobs. He is always -- as a TV analyst, as a future N.F.L. coach -- a man in demand. Surely he would provide journalistic dividends to his employers, first at NBC's ''N.F.L. Live,'' and now at ESPN's ''N.F.L. Countdown,'' with inside stuff about Bill Parcells.
2002-12-19	ESPN's new message: Sports is not a metaphor for life, sports is life. So name your child ESPN.	IN its efforts to be a ubiquitous part of the sports world, ESPN has few media rivals. The flagship channel is available in 87 million homes and has 97 percent awareness among American adults, according to ESPN executives, who say that certain truly fanatical parents have even given their children the network's brand name. Now, ESPN plans to celebrate the face-painter in us all with a campaign that makes the none-too-subtle point to both viewers and advertisers that the cable network is synonymous with sports.
2002-11-20	Penn's Record 'GameDay'	On Saturday mornings, ESPN's ''College GameDay'' travels to the glamour towns of the sport -- Ann Arbor, South Bend, Gainesville, Tallahassee and Columbus -- to preview the afternoon's games, particularly the one to be played where they have set up their studio set. But last Saturday, at the request of the Ivy League, the 90-minute program showed up at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, where Penn played Harvard.
2002-11-16	Improbable Spotlight On the Ivy League	A 48-foot party trailer pulled onto the Penn campus for several days of tailgating and promotional activities. A stage was built in the horseshoe curve of Franklin Field for an ESPN pregame show. Television cameras even dropped by the Wharton School to film Penn's quarterback, as if to document an endangered species: a college football player who actually attends classes. For a rare Saturday, the country's most compelling game will feature a matchup for the championship of the Ivy League between the University of Pennsylvania (7-1) and Harvard (6-2). At least for one afternoon, commentators can speak earnestly of ''student-athletes'' without having to wink or cross their fingers behind their backs.
2002-10-31	In Season of Change, Nets Are Hard to Find	In a season of widespread change on the National Basketball Association's television landscape, NBC is gone, ESPN and ABC are in, and TNT is the exclusive home of the league on Thursday nights. Bill Walton has left NBC for ABC and ESPN, and his partner, Brad Nessler, a veteran of college basketball work with Dick Vitale, takes the lead broadcast role that was held by Marv Albert, who remains the No. 1 voice at TNT.
2002-10-28	On College Football; Voters' Snub Of Notre Dame Doesn't Add Up	In politics and on talk shows they are called hot-button issues; the topics that transcend mundane policy and lend themselves to searing rhetoric and roil the very souls of people. Entertainingly enough, college football has itself a burn-to-the-touch one thanks to the improbable success of Notre Dame. Here is a sample e-mail message, one of many from readers last week:
2002-10-20	Fox's Blather	To the Sports Editor: Having watched the various combinations at ESPN this past year, it is clear that all of the commentators at Fox need to be sent to figure skating competitions and not to baseball games.
2002-10-14	ESPN Brings Video Clips To High-Speed Net Users	The sports Web site ESPN.com plans to introduce a free video-clip service to high-speed Internet users in the next few weeks. The Web site, affiliated with the ESPN cable sports channel and owned by the Walt Disney Company, has developed a technology called ESPN Motion to put video clips -- along with television commercials -- right on its home page.
2002-10-04	ABC Family Offers Familiar ESPN Look	Watch the baseball division series games on ABC Family, and all you see is ESPN. On yesterday's St. Louis-Arizona game, it was ESPN's music (''Love Theme for Karl Ravech'') graphics, production and announcers. ESPN's Chris Berman, the game's play-by-play voice, is big but does not moonlight on ABC Family's ''Braceface.'' Yet. ABC Family is not a sports programming network, so why is a teen-oriented channel carrying the playoff games that Fox does not? Why aren't they on ESPN, which may be expanding into sports-themed entertainment fare but not into the annual ''13 Nights of Halloween'' extravaganza on ABC Family?
2002-09-08	Giving New Meaning To 'Special Teams'	A football game seems to be an inconsequential footnote to the tragedies of Sept. 11. But one, last May's annual match between the city's Fire and Police Departments, was freighted with inspiration and sorrow. Of the 343 firefighters who died at the World Trade Center, seven played for the Bravest. Fifteen were alumni. Two of the dead were the team's quarterbacks. But the resurrection of the team and its preparations for the annual grudge match against the police became a symbol of the survival of the Fire Department, a story told with grace and respect by NFL Films in ''The Bravest Team: The Rebuilding of the FDNY Football Club'' (Tuesday at 9 p.m. Eastern on ESPN).
2002-08-19	Morgan's Plea: Don't Shift Soriano	Whenever Joe Morgan sees Yankees Manager Joe Torre, he implores him to keep Alfonso Soriano at second base. Do not move him. Do not even think about shifting him. Leave him alone and he will continue blossoming into one of the premier second basemen in baseball. He may be the best at his position already. Torre smiled last week as he recalled the exchanges with Morgan, the Hall of Fame second baseman, who is a baseball analyst for ESPN. But Morgan was serious. He said that Soriano had more ability than any second baseman he had seen in the last two decades and that it would be illogical to shift him to another position.
2002-08-18	Skateboarders Are Landing in Real World	Pierre-Luc Gagnon was some 40 feet from the ground when he caught an edge with his skateboard. His exhilarating ride had ended badly. He didn't much like the ramp installed for the X Games competition this weekend. ''It's the same ramp they used in Dallas and Atlanta,'' Gagnon said. ''Why don't they just bring in a new one?''
2002-08-08	ESPN Shifts N.H.L. Games To Make Way for the N.B.A.	ESPN will shift its marquee National Hockey League games from Wednesday to Thursday next season and reduce the number of its and ESPN2's hockey telecasts. The move to Thursday was necessitated by the purchase of rights to National Basketball Association games, which will be seen on ESPN on Wednesday and Friday nights.
2002-08-07	Hewitt Wins, but Faces A Fine From the ATP	The same combative nature that pumps air into Lleyton Hewitt's lungs during a match has apparently left him miscast in the role of No. 1 player in the world. Hewitt, a 21-year-old Australian, enjoys the fight to keep his perch, but not the responsibility of having it. Faced with at least a $20,000 fine from the Association of Tennis Professionals for not fulfilling his duties to promote the sport today, Hewitt threatened to walk out of the Tennis Masters Series Cincinnati tournament just minutes before he was to play Robby Ginepri.
2002-08-01	Parcells to Join ESPN's N.F.L. Team	After signing a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract yesterday to become one of the guys on ESPN's ''Sunday N.F.L. Countdown,'' Bill Parcells said, ''This is the end of it,'' when asked about the constant rumors that he would return to coaching. But is it not true that Parcells was talking to Tampa Bay about coaching only last January -- barely two years after leaving the Jets, where he had vowed never again to return to coaching? ''My dad used to tell me you never lose anything by listening,'' Parcells said in a conference call.
2002-07-26	ABC and ESPN Name N.B.A. Lineup	Brad Nessler and Bill Walton were named the lead National Basketball Association announcers for ABC Sports and ESPN yesterday, and will call ABC's Sunday afternoon and ESPN's Wednesday night games. Mike Tirico and Tom Tolbert will be the hosts of ABC's studio program. Each announcer will also call separate games on ESPN's Friday night doubleheaders.
2002-07-21	Man's Best Friend	The Sit-Down Comic 6:28 p.m. (32 minutes to game time) Rich Eisen, ESPN ''SportsCenter'' anchor and ESPN2 play-by-play novitiate, looks out at some of the 12,402 San Diego Padres fans settling into their seats on an unseasonably cool May evening and informs Chili Davis, his partner in the booth: ''The crowd is gathering. The crowd is congealing. The crowd is coagulating.''
2002-06-13	ABC And ESPN2 To Broadcast W.N.B.A. Games	ESPN2 and ABC Sports will televise Women's National Basketball Association games for six seasons, starting next year, the league and the networks said yesterday. ABC replaces NBC as the league's broadcast outlet. ESPN has shown W.N.B.A. games since its inception but will shift its coverage to ESPN2. ESPN and ABC are not paying a rights fee but will share revenues with the league.
2002-06-06	At World Cup Time, The Web Never Sleeps	IT is a trying time to follow the World Cup soccer tournament in the United States. Although it is the largest international sporting event, it is still considered an oddity by many Americans who associate a football with pigskin. And because the games are being played in the afternoon and evening in South Korea and Japan, they are broadcast live in North America in the early hours of the morning, inevitably resulting in sleep deprivation. But it is worse for Richard Eoin Nash, who cannot watch most of the games at his Brooklyn apartment because he lacks cable television. So Mr. Nash, a 30-year-old writer and performance artist from Ireland, depends almost entirely on the Internet to follow the Cup's progress.
2002-06-05	BOLDFACE NAMES	Hoops Tune Won't Jump Enjoy the theme for those NBC National Basketball Association games while it is still possible. JOHN TESH, who wrote it, does not expect it to go along when the N.B.A. jumps to ABC and ESPN next season. He says ESPN has already told him that it plans to find a new theme. ''My point is, if you purchased 'Entertainment Tonight,' would you change the theme?'' he said. ABC and ESPN, along with AOL Time Warner's TNT unit, outbid NBC for the rights to six years of the N.B.A. in a $4.6 billion deal. Mr. Tesh, the musician and former ''Entertainment Tonight'' host, does not want the tune to go unheard for long. ''We are in talks with a few folks about licensing it for other use,'' he said. ''College basketball is also an option.'' A spokesman for ESPN did not return a call for comment. Profiles in Diplomacy The question for EDWIN A. SCHLOSSBERG was: Who is easier to live with during the creative process, you or your wife? A moment's silence, then the diplomatic answer: ''It's about even.'' Does that mean both are terrific, or both are dreadful? ''Oh, we're both so easy,'' Mr. Schlossberg said. Then he grinned. ''You know, she just wrote the introduction.'' It wasn't necessary for him to identify the ''she.'' He was referring to his wife, CAROLINE KENNEDY, the guest of honor at the party that was swirling around Mr. Schlossberg on the second floor of Tiffany & Company on Monday. She has just updated her father's Pulitzer Prize-winning book under the title ''Profiles in Courage for Our Time.'' So how long did she work on it? ''We've been talking about it for a few years,'' she said. ''My brother John and I wanted to do it.'' But the new generation found a new publisher for the new version of the book: Hyperion, not Harper, which published the original, and not Doubleday, where her mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, worked as a senior editor until her death in 1994. Keeping It in the Family The memo said, right there in capital letters, that HENRY LUCE III was resigning as chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation. ''No, I'm not,'' declared Mr. Luce, 77, the son of the co-founder of Time magazine. ''I'm retiring.'' Whatever the verb, the Luce Foundation will still be led by a Luce after Mr. Luce, its chief executive for 43 years and chairman for 11, steps down (he will stay on the board). MARGARET BOLES FITZGERALD, a first cousin once removed, is expected to be confirmed as chairwoman and presiding officer at a board meeting next week. She is a vice president of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopoulos, an advertising agency in Boston that is part of the Interpublic Group, and has experience with corporate philanthropy and nonprofit groups. ''If Hank was going to scan the family landscape,'' she said, ''it wasn't as if I was doing anything unrelated. I think he looked around the next generation 15 years ago without my knowing it and started asking me about my job. Today, at any given time, I'm working with 15 to 20 nonprofits doing pro bono marketing. It wasn't out of left field.'' Thank You and Goodbye When the York Theater Company called, the producer CAMERON MACKINTOSH said he had a deadline. He said that he would accept the Oscar Hammerstein Award for lifetime achievement on Monday -- the day the company had already booked Florence Gould Hall at the Alliance Française on East 59th Street for the ceremony -- but that he had to leave quickly. ''He said, 'I have to be out of there by 8:15 because I have to be on a plane at 10:30,' '' said JAMES MORGAN, the company's artistic director. Sir Cameron had a date yesterday morning in London -- appearing at the closing of the four-day national holiday celebrating the half-century reign of QUEEN ELIZABETH II. ''We made it,'' Mr. Morgan said yesterday. Did Sir Cameron take a commercial jet or a private plane? ''He didn't say,'' Mr. Morgan said.
2002-05-13	Sports News Shows Come and Go, but 'SportsCenter' Keeps on Rolling	Come Wednesday, ESPN's ''SportsCenter'' will have all to itself the rabid attention of cable viewers hungering for a daily fix of national sports scores, news and highlights. On that day, CNN/SI, the 24-hour sports network begun in 1996 by Time Warner's Cable News Network and Sports Illustrated magazine, will disappear from the disappointingly small number of homes that received the signal.
2002-04-04	Interactive TV Is Finally Here, Sort Of	INTERACTIVE television has arrived. It is not widespread, but it is here -- right here, in the home of Steve and Vanessa Murphy. When the Murphys don't feel like going out for an evening, they can curl up on the couch, pick up the television remote and choose from among 200 on-demand movies offered by their cable company, Insight Communications. The movie starts immediately, and they can pause, fast-forward and rewind it as if it were a Blockbuster video.
2002-04-04	Costas Says No To ESPN Offer	Bob Costas's exclusive three-year deal with HBO Sports, which includes an extension for his ''On the Record'' program and his addition to the ''Inside the N.F.L.'' studio show, means he cannot pursue a deal with ESPN. ESPN offered Costas a role in its N.B.A. coverage and play-by-play of 10 to 12 baseball games. It also offered the hosting duties of a weekly one-hour interview program and specials surrounding major events.
2002-03-30	Scrutiny Awaits The Nets' Martin	Kenyon Martin sat surrounded by a larger than usual contingent of cameras and reporters today, and as the questions came, he sat quietly, smiling and shaking his head, refusing to talk about the controversy involving him. On Saturday, he will return to the Nets' lineup against the Philadelphia 76ers at Continental Arena after serving a two-game suspension for his latest flagrant foul. This season Martin has 6 flagrant fouls and 8 flagrant foul points. He has missed seven games because of suspensions. He has also lost $347,057.55 in wages and fines. Those are numbers that are moving into Dennis Rodman's range.
2002-03-12	Story Behind 'Brink' May Be the Real Story	ESPN must have felt a need to atone for the sin of overpromoting its first original film, ''A Season on the Brink,'' to the point of seasickness. I love the actor Brian Dennehy, who plays Coach Bob Knight in the movie, but I need counseling for the horrific nightmares I've been suffering about a large man in a red sweater who needs his filthy mouth washed out with lye soap. Yes, Mr. Dennehy, I will play your way. Yes, Mr. Dennehy, I am your humble and obedient hoops liege.
2002-03-10	Sports of The Times; Bob Knight Delivers His Rebuttal to Indiana in His Autobiography	BOB KNIGHT is center stage again, in three different theaters. His Texas Tech basketball team is expected to be included in the national tournament tonight. He's being played by Brian Dennehy in tonight's ESPN movie, ''A Season on the Brink,'' with and without what is advertised as ''intense adult language.'' His autobiography, ''Knight: My Story'' (St. Martin's Press, $25.95), written with Bob Hammel, is on the way to the bookstores. And it's not in the Indiana University bookstore yet. ''If somebody orders it, we'll get it,'' the woman who answered the phone at the bookstore said on Friday. ''Nobody has ordered it yet.''
2002-03-09	A Movie on Two Channels, One With Cussing	Who says television isn't innovative? Tomorrow night ESPN is interrupting its format of sports events and sports talk to offer -- ta-daaa -- a sports movie. The network has been knocking itself out to promote its first dramatic film, ''A Season on the Brink,'' starring Brian Dennehy as Bobby Knight, the notoriously volatile and profane college basketball coach. It isn't much of a movie, but if the viewers tune in, other niche cable channels could follow. Imagine the Food Network producing a remake of ''Wild Strawberries'' or ''The Fortune Cookie.'' How about a musical? CNN presents Joel Grey as ''George W.!'' (''A real, live scion of my Daddy George, born on the Fourth of July.'')
2002-03-05	N.F.L. to Open on a Thursday	The National Football League made it official yesterday, confirming that the 2002 season would start on Thursday night, Sept. 5, with the game almost certain to be played in Giants Stadium. The Giants are expected to play host to the San Francisco 49ers in a game televised by ESPN. The Giants-49ers matchup will not become official until the full schedule is completed about a month from now. Nevertheless, Giants Coach Jim Fassel talked yesterday as if the game were already official, saying the Thursday opener ''creates some real challenges for us, both in terms of scheduling and because the 49ers are an outstanding team that was in the playoffs last season.''
2002-03-05	Costas Is on Wish List At ABC and ESPN	Bob Costas will be a free agent in midsummer when his contract ends, raising the legitimate possibility that he and NBC Sports will part. He has called baseball and basketball, anchored the Olympics in prime time four times and been the host of NBC's N.B.A. and N.F.L. studio programs.
2002-01-23	The N.B.A. Takes the Money in a Fast Break to Cable	The National Basketball Association is suffering from declining ratings and the advertising marketplace is in a tailspin, yet those obstacles did not prevent AOL Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company from agreeing to new television deals worth $4.6 billion to the league over the next six seasons. In deals announced yesterday, Disney will pay the league $2.4 billion for games that will be shown on ESPN and ABC; AOL Time Warner is paying $2.2 billion to televise games on TNT and to create a new all-sports network with the league.
2002-01-09	NBC Will Live Without N.B.A. and Without Losses From It	To Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, relinquishing the rights to televise the National Basketball Association after this season is all about financial common sense. ''The idea of winning in this business has gotten distorted,'' he said yesterday during an interview with New York Times reporters and editors. ''To lose hundreds of millions of dollars is not winning.''
2002-01-03	M.L.S. Gets Rights To Show Cup Games	Major League Soccer, seeking to be the television broker of its sport in the United States, has acquired the domestic rights to the 2002 and 2006 men's World Cups and the 2003 women's World Cup. The league placed the games on ESPN and ABC. The deal includes an extension through 2006 to show M.L.S. games on ABC and ESPN2 at no cost to the networks. As with the World Cups, a company created by M.L.S. investors will sell the advertising and pay production costs.
2001-12-02	In Cable's Niches, Drama Is Gaining on Real Life	EVER since CBS first hit it big with ''Survivor'' a year and a half ago, the broadcast networks have been pursuing a similar success with the lemming-like zeal of comedians in pursuit of a Michael Jackson joke. But while the broadcast networks have been flooding the airwaves with what we've come to know as reality shows -- although what eating sheep eyeballs or squirming in a vat of live rats has to do with the real world is difficult to say -- several cable channels that built their schedules around reality have moved in the opposite direction, adding scripted, dramatic programming to their lineups.
2001-11-13	McGwire Gives ESPN News First	Mark McGwire chose to announce his retirement to ESPN's Rich Eisen because of a professional relationship that began two years ago. They met at the 1999 ESPY's and have seen each other since, said Diane Lamb, an ESPN spokeswoman, referring to the network's annual awards program. And Mark appreciates the forum that Rich and ESPN provide.
2001-10-19	Networks May Seek Relief From N.F.L.	Sometime soon, possibly after the season, the networks carrying National Football League games should tell the league: We can't afford what we're paying. We want major relief. Profit assumptions made before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have been revised as an already swooning advertising market has hit the skids.
2001-10-16	Any Day Is Now a Game Day as TV Schedules Expand	History will be made tonight at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium in Louisville. A college football game will be played there -- on a Tuesday night. No one can recall a regular-season game being played on a Tuesday, the traditional night for ''Frasier,'' not for college football. Why are the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles in Louisville, Ky., on a day once deemed alien to college football, going into territory never trod upon by Bear Bryant or Bud Wilkinson?
2001-08-31	Interview Turns Into Grudge Match	It was the unscheduled (it seems) undercard to the Nov. 17 main event, when Hasim Rahman is to defend his heavyweight title belts against the man he dethroned, Lennox Lewis. They chose not to put up their dukes in a gym or an arena, but to scuffle on a set at the ESPN Zone restaurant yesterday in Anaheim, Calif., where the boxers were taping an interview with Gary Miller for ESPN's ''Up Close'' program.
2001-08-25	Bronx Team Hits An ESPN High	The 1-0 victory Thursday night by the Rolando Paulino team from the Bronx generated the highest Nielsen rating ever on ESPN or ESPN2 for the Little League World Series. The Bronx team's victory over Oceanside, Calif., in the United States semifinals, which was on ESPN, produced a 2.82 national cable rating, or 2.3 million households.
2001-08-21	'SportsCenter' Trips On Feeble Crossover	A few years ago, a spot in ESPN's ''This Is SportsCenter'' advertising campaign found the anchor Charley Steiner trading in his job to become a pool boy on ''Melrose Place,'' while the ''Melrose Place'' star Andrew Shue became a sports anchor. On Sunday night's ''SportsCenter,'' ESPN turned ditsy parody into reality by enlisting the actor Freddie Prinze Jr. to conduct the program's conversation with Derek Jeter and to provide the voice-over to highlights from the Mariners-Yankees series.
2001-08-17	Metro Business Briefing | Protest Against Radio Format	Several hundred people gathered outside the Forward Association's office in Midtown yesterday to protest its decision to switch the format of its radio station, WEVD-AM (1050), to an ESPN 24-hour sports talk channel on Sept. 1 as part of a lease agreement with the Walt Disney Company. The move would end several radio programs, including those of Bill Mazer, Alan Colmes and Edward I. Koch. The association, which owns The Forward, said that it made the agreement to pay for its money-losing newspapers. Jayson Blair (NYT)
2001-07-08	Great Outdoor Games, Part 2	The Great Outdoor Games, a four-day skills and strength competition created and organized by ESPN, will return for its second year, beginning Thursday in Lake Placid, N.Y. More than 300 of the world's best competitors will vie in 21 events in four sport categories -- fishing, timber events, sporting dogs and target sports. Nineteen hours of the competition will be telecast from July 26-Aug. 3. on ESPN.
2001-05-25	TV spots for women's basketball showcase the beauty and grace of the game and its players.	IT is a sport whose hallmarks are speed, teamwork and beauty -- the beauty of the plays and of the players themselves. And those are the qualities that have provided ESPN with a theme for its campaign promoting women's professional basketball and the 2001 Women's National Basketball Association season, the league's fifth, which will begin on Monday. The campaign's title, logically enough, is Basketball Is Beautiful. It consists of five black-and-white, 30-second spots shot by Nzingha Stewart, a young director who is best known for music videos for rap artists like Memphis Bleek and Common. The campaign began this week on ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN News, and will run through the summer.
2001-05-01	Ratings Continue To Decline in N.H.L.	National Hockey League ratings continue to decline. Through Friday's playoff games, ESPN's Nielsen rating is down 14 percent to a 0.62 (or 508,400 cable households), from last year and ESPN2's rating has decreased 6 percent to a 0.49 (372,400 households).
2001-03-28	Disney Is Cutting 4,000 Jobs Worldwide	In a move executives described as the most significant job reduction in the company's history, the Walt Disney Company will eliminate 4,000 jobs, about 3 percent of its work force, through buyouts and possibly mandatory layoffs, the company announced yesterday. The order will affect every Disney division worldwide. In a letter to employees, Michael D. Eisner, the Disney chairman, and Robert A. Iger, the president, called the job cuts ''the most difficult series of decisions the company has made in the last 20 years.''
2001-02-27	ESPN campaign uses a 'hostile' Web site to send viewers its way.	ANXIOUS advertisers are studying a myriad of methods to encourage visits to their World Wide Web sites, but few have considered a multimedia campaign to urge computer users to not visit their Web sites. But one big media company is undertaking just such an exercise in reverse psychology, with apparent success so far. ESPN, the sports cable television network owned by the Walt Disney Company, is sponsoring a humorous campaign centered on a faux Web site that asks visitors to avoid the ESPN Web site (www.espn.com). The let's-pretend site was created along with the campaign by the Marina del Rey, Calif., office of Ground Zero, a shop known for its irreverent work that is among several on the ESPN agency roster.
2001-02-01	Boarders Will Leave the Slopes For a Battle of the Thumbs	When some of the best snowboard athletes meet next week for the ESPN Winter X Games, they will have to share their arena with snowboarders who are masters of a smaller domain: the PlayStation 2 video game console. For the first time, video gamers will be an official part of a flesh-and-blood athletic competition, which is scheduled for Feb. 3 in Mount Snow, Vt. Some professional snowboarders are expected to take on video gamers on the digital slopes of Snowboarding, a game by Konami of America. Besides bragging rights, the winner will be given a gold medal. The video game finals will be broadcast on Monday evening on ESPN. MICHEL MARRIOTT
2001-01-14	From Behind the Center to Behind the Mike	TWO large television monitors show the quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings, Daunte Culpepper, flow out of the grasp of the Green Bay Packers' Vonnie Holliday and throw an 80-yard touchdown pass to his wide receiver, Randy Moss. And then they show it again. And again. And again. The mustachioed man in the chair by one monitor moves the play forward and back, six, eight, a dozen times with his remote control. By now, even the video version of Mr. Culpepper must be tired of eluding Mr. Holliday's clutches.
2001-01-10	Parcells May Go Looking for a Booth	Bill Parcells, who stepped down yesterday as the Jets' director of football operations, began gauging interest in a TV career at the end of last week, when his agent, Jimmy Sexton, called ESPN. Sexton also called Fox Sports on Monday. At ESPN, the job would be a studio analyst for the Sunday ''NFL Countdown'' program, the same role he inquired about last year when he stepped down as the Jets' coach.
2000-12-19	ESPN Gets to Be a Fly on the Wall of the Hot Stove	ESPN had a plan: find an agent who would let its cameras record contract negotiations from the inside for the Sunday morning program ''Outside the Lines.'' ESPN found him in Jeff Moorad, the agent for Manny Ramirez, following him from October until he agreed with the Boston Red Sox last week on an eight-year, $160 million contract.
2000-11-20	Nine Moments and a Legal Decision	In the compilation of the greatest athletes and athletic events of the 20th century, women appeared to get short shrift. Only eight women made ESPN's list of the century's top 100 North American athletes. And only two -- Babe Didrikson and Martina Navratilova -- were among the top 20.
2000-09-01	Umpires to Wear Cameras on Hats	The National Football League will allow television networks to outfit an on-field official with a miniature television camera during regular-season and postseason games this year. The N.F.L. allowed networks to experiment with the tiny camera during nine preseason games, giving fans a close-up view of the action in the middle of the field.
2000-08-03	As Games Rivet TV Networks, Cable Upstarts Sail Into Drama; FX, MTV, and Others Add Original Films and Series	FX is one of those cable networks that many channel surfers glide past because it offers reruns of enduring hits like ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' ''The X-Files'' and ''Married with Children.'' But Peter Liguori, president of FX Networks, which is owned by the News Corporation, said that like other cable stations, FX was trying to get more attention and reinvent itself in the face of an increasingly competitive network arena obsessed with reality programs like CBS's ''Survivor'' and quiz shows like ABC's ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''
2000-07-23	Great Outdoors Is Now a Game	Sports has gone to the dogs, and fish, and ax-wielders. In its never-endingpursuit of programming, ESPN created and organized the Great Outdoor Games, which started Thursday and end today in Lake Placid, N.Y. More than 200 competitors in 21 events are vying for $300,000 in prizes.
2000-06-16	Baseball Ups the Ante for Fox and NBC	In its new network rights deal, Major League Baseball is seeking two to three times as much as the combined $975 million that Fox and NBC are paying in their current deals, which expire after this season. Baseball was emboldened to seek more from NBC and Fox because it negotiated a deal with ESPN last year in which the cable network will pay an average $138.5 million annually, nearly four times as much as its 1999 fee.
2000-06-01	ESPN Stumbles in Knight Interview	If you were to interview Richard Nixon about his vice presidential years, surely you would watch his Checkers speech. If you were to chat with President Clinton about his impeachment, surely you would watch his taped deposition. And if you were chosen to interview Indiana Coach Bob Knight about his anger management problems, you would obviously watch the 1997 tape of him applying a one-handed choke hold to the throat of Neil Reed, a former player.
2000-05-25	ESPN Golf Analyst Leaves for NBC	Jimmy Roberts, one of the leading correspondents at ESPN, is joining NBC Sports next month in time for the United States Open golf championship. Roberts, whose specialty at ESPN was golf reporting and essays, will be covering golf, tennis, horse racing and the Olympics for NBC.
2000-04-26	Senior PGA Tour To Switch Networks	After 18 years on ESPN, the Senior PGA Tour will move to CNBC, the business channel, next year. It is a strange move, to leave the comfort of an all-sports cable network for one that carries no sports on a regular basis. ''We got solid treatment from ESPN,'' said Tim Finchem, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, which owns the Senior PGA Tour. ''But when you're the sports darling of CNBC, we anticipate a high prioritization to make the franchise work.''
2000-03-31	Different Styles Mean Different Dollar Values	With the men's and women's N.C.A.A. tournaments in their Final Four phases, let's examine how their networks value them. CBS is paying $265 million for this year's men's event. ESPN has paid $2.7 million a year since 1996 for the women's event, plus other N.C.A.A. championships.
2000-03-21	Book on ESPN Looks Behind Its Jolly Image	ESPN seems like a jolly empire, transmitting sports nonstop across the galaxy by cable, satellite, Internet, books, a magazine and a restaurant chain. Once given a moth's chance of surviving an encounter with the sun, it is now a monolith with cash flow that is the envy of many Westernized nations.
2000-01-27	When the Game's on the Line, the Line's on the Screen	DURING last year's Super Bowl, partygoers could rack up another advantage over fans who attended the game. Not only did television watchers save the price of admission, get all the munchies they could eat and have a chance to critique the latest batch of million-dollar commercials, but they could also see exactly where the first-down stripe was. Instead of squinting at linesmen, chains and poles, home viewers could see a computer-generated yellow stripe across the field, marking the line that the offensive team had to cross to make a first down.
2000-01-14	Rocker Is Off Base In ESPN Interview	John Rocker's agents chose the reporter they wanted to interview him for the first time following his disparaging remarks about gays and minority group members last month. They also chose the place where Rocker would be interviewed. Unfortunately for Randy and Alan Hendricks, Rocker's agents, they could not pick someone else to speak for their client. Rocker had three weeks to prepare for the interview, which was televised on ESPN Wednesday night. Three weeks for the Atlanta Braves pitcher to ponder the criticism he had received from teammates, Braves' officials like Hank Aaron, community and civic leaders, and the news media.
1999-12-17	Beauty of Owens Is Seen in Tribute	ESPN's ''SportsCentury'' tribute to Jesse Owens as the sixth greatest athlete of the century, airing tonight, shows the late track and field star crushing Hitler's claims of Aryan supremacy at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. But Owens's four gold medals and his status as a champion of social justice were not the first memories of Marty Glickman, a fellow sprinter on the United States team. Glickman, 82, and John Woodruff, another of Owens's teammates, watched the ''SportsCentury'' preview in Manhattan yesterday. Glickman said he was struck by Owens's ''beauty.''
1999-12-14	Top Athletes Countdown Is a Big Step Up for ESPN	If you've watched ESPN's ''SportsCentury'' countdown, your choices for the century's greatest North American athletes may differ from the cable network's. But who ranks where is irrelevant -- except as fodder for amusing debates that go nowhere -- because the 50 profiles stand as ESPN's most creative work in its 20-year history. They, not their order, demand attention. They're packed with surprises (an old friend of Lou Gehrig's weeping in remembrance), distinguished by balance and enterprise in finding people who are not the usual interview suspects, and made memorable by a sensual visual style.
1999-11-30	It's The Big Game: ESPN v. Baseball	There is hot stove league news more riveting than questions about the Mets' ability to keep John Olerud or the Yankees' desire to re-sign David Cone. It is the federal trial between ESPN and Major League Baseball, which starts Monday in Manhattan. The legal set-to promises to be a dandy for its revelation of financial details and its demonstration of long-simmering hostilities.
1999-11-23	League Strikes Television Deals	The Arena Football League, the high-scoring downsized version of traditional football, which helped the St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner learn to make quick decisions, announced three-year television deals yesterday with TNN, ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC worth $25 million in cash and promotional value. The deals ensure that TNN will carry regular-season games on 14 consecutive weeks, plus four playoff games; ESPN and ESPN2 will show up to six playoff games, and ABC will carry the Arena Bowl championship game, as it has for two years.
1999-11-16	A Crossover Dribble By ESPN's Roberts	Bill Bradley's presidential fund-raiser Sunday at Madison Square Garden brought together Bradley's former Knick teammates like Willis Reed and Walt Frazier with other former stars like Bill Russell and Julius Erving. But the appearance of one person in a prominent role seemed out of place. I looked at a photograph of Robin Roberts standing beside Bradley, Dave DeBusschere and Jerry Lucas and wondered: What was she doing there?
1999-10-20	Bates Will Promote ESPN Outside U.S.	ESPN International, the overseas operations of the sports cable television network ESPN, said yesterday that it had awarded its international branding assignment to Bates Worldwide in New York, part of Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C. Billings have not been determined. The decision came after a three-month review, said Mike Wade, a spokesman for ESPN Inc. in Bristol, Conn., that had been narrowed to Bates and agencies he declined to identify.
1999-10-19	For Morgan, So Much to Say and So Little Time	One of Joe Morgan's frustrations as a baseball analyst for NBC and ESPN is the lack of sufficient time to say everything that is on his mind. Part of that stems from Morgan's failure to be a chatterbox seeking to hog every free moment for himself. ''I always feel the game is more important than my comments,'' he said yesterday from his hotel in Atlanta, where he and Bob Costas will call Game 6 of the National League Championship Series tonight. ''If a guy is ready to hit the ball, it's more important than what I have to say. If I talk during a home run, that's the biggest sin I can commit.''
1999-09-21	ESPN and ABC Sports To Merge Sales Staffs	ESPN and ABC Sports, New York, both part of the Walt Disney Company, said yesterday that they would merge their advertising sales staffs.
1999-09-17	Campaigns use flash, dash and Claymation to promote the TV networks' football coverage.	FOR more than a decade, the testosterone-driven network studio programs that precede National Football League games on Sundays have been battlegrounds for analysis, features and scoops on signings, suspensions and injuries. The Fox and CBS programs from noon to 1 P.M. are attempts to lure fans to watch the games that come after them. And ESPN's show, which now runs from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M., is a huge pre-game appetizer, a reminder to watch its game at 8:15 P.M.
1999-09-15	Brown and Russell On Top 20 List	When Jim Brown watched Bill Russell play basketball, he observed the former Boston Celtics center in an unusual way. I loved his mind -- I could see his mind work and it translated into making him such a great player, the former Cleveland Browns running back said yesterday.
1999-09-07	Sports Business; At ESPN, the Revolution Was Televised	Some revolutions are planned. ESPN's was not. There was no intention of hijacking the sports world when a former hockey public relations man bought satellite time to start showing Connecticut sports on cable television 20 years ago today. The revolution needed time to percolate, but ESPN showed viewers that highlights need not be confined to three and a half minutes appended to the end of a local newscast, that the early rounds of the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball tournament contained many earthly delights and that the National Football League draft offered the reward of watching your team try to better itself before your eyes.
1999-09-03	ESPN Expects to Win Baseball Suit	The Yankees-Angels game on Sunday could be the final edition of ESPN's ''Sunday Night Baseball.'' It will certainly be the last one this season, pending the outcome of a simmering legal bout between ESPN and Major League Baseball. But don't expect ESPN to mark the occasion with weepy speeches by Jon Miller and Joe Morgan or a dramatic retrospective of memorable Bat Tracks past.
1999-08-24	DISNEY'S BRITAIN INTERNET DEAL	The new-media unit of the Walt Disney Company, the Buena Vista Internet Group, acquired 60 percent of the Web site Soccernet from Daily Mail and General Trust P.L.C. of Britain in an effort to expand its soccer coverage on its ESPN Web sites and to help promote the ESPN.com brand internationally. Terms were not disclosed. The move is part of Disney's strategy to develop an audience for its Web sites beyond the United States. Andrew Ross Sorkin
1999-07-09	Positive Ratings for Soccer Are Raising Some Eyebrows	In 1996, the United States Olympic women's soccer team was barely noticed by NBC, even when it defeated China for the gold medal. Now, as the United States team faces China tomorrow on ABC at 3:30 P.M. in the final game of the Women's World Cup, the telegenic, successful players are showing that viewers will watch if the matches can be seen.
1999-06-23	Stanley Cup Series Ratings Are Up	Dallas's triple-overtime victory in Buffalo in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals on ESPN produced a 3.51 rating and helped the cable network to a 3.09 average rating for Games 3, 4 and 6, up by 17 percent from last year.
1999-06-13	Broadcast Coverage Focuses on an Exciting U.S. Team With Candid Audio	The Women's World Cup is not as venerated or historic as its male counterpart, which was played for the 16th time last year. But in its third edition, the women's tournament has an advantage that ESPN and ABC can relish: the United States team is arguably the world's best and is a favorite to win. There are no tales of the United States women's team struggling to meet the talent levels of the Brazilian, Argentine, German or Italian teams. For the women's team, most of the rest of the world is playing catchup.
1999-06-13	To Go Where No Woman Has Gone Before	For the best female soccer players in the world, the passion play of a lifetime begins on Saturday at 3 P.M. with the start of the third FIFA Women's World Cup of soccer. The United States will play host to the quadrennial tournament, culminating in the championship game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., on July 12. The tournament has been expanded to 16 national teams and will be played at several locations around the country: East Rutherford, N.J.; Foxboro, Mass.; Chicago; Pasadena, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Palo Alto and San Jose, Calif., and Washington, beginning with a doubleheader at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford.
1999-05-28	ABC and Indy Still a Twosome	When ABC Sports officials began planning their Indianapolis 500 coverage four months ago, they viewed Sunday's race, which begins at 11 A.M., as possibly their last after 35 years. Fox looked like the favorite to grab the rights. The interest existed despite ratings that have fallen since the Indy Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams petulantly split in 1995. Neither did the lack of Indianapolis 500 stars who are capable of rivaling Nascar's Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt reduce ABC's ardor.
1999-05-25	ESPN Sunday Night: Truth is Somewhere	Lawsuits are being lobbed so rapidly between Major League Baseball and ESPN that Bat Track technology may be required in Federal court to determine who slugs harder, Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, or George Bodenheimer, the ESPN president. ''If Selig triggers his hitch in time, he gets his bat up to 93 miles per hour,'' Joe Morgan might say. ''Bodenheimer has a quick swing, hits to the opposite field and if he's not fooled by a slider, he can swing like Bud.''
1999-05-22	Rift Over Sunday Night Games	A nasty battle over ESPN's proposed shift of Sunday night baseball games in September to ESPN2 widened yesterday when Major League Baseball replied to ESPN's recent Federal lawsuit with a countersuit of its own. Baseball has spurned ESPN's plan to move the three September games to ESPN2 and put National Football League games on ESPN.
1999-05-07	Impasse Between ESPN and Major League Baseball Was Bound to Occur	As ESPN's chief baseball analyst, Joe Morgan is rarely called upon to analyze the corporate doings of his employer. But that changed on Tuesday when ESPN sued Major League Baseball in Federal court to block baseball's termination of the cable network's regular-season deal after this season. Baseball has been irate for 16 months over ESPN's plan to shift three Sunday night games in September to ESPN2 in favor of National Football League games. ''I'm very disappointed that they haven't worked this out,'' Morgan said. ''But I can see both sides. Baseball is saying the N.F.L. is more important, but ESPN is saying it wants to do a good job for baseball and for the N.F.L. Since 1990, ESPN has done more for baseball than anyone.''
1999-05-05	ESPN Sues Over Sunday Night Baseball	ESPN asked a Federal judge yesterday to halt Major League Baseball's termination of their contract after this season over the cable giant's plan to shift three Sunday night games in September from ESPN to ESPN2. In papers filed with United States District Court in Manhattan, ESPN said that it has made numerous efforts over the past year to make the switch to ESPN2 more palatable to baseball but that all were rejected.
1999-04-12	Remote Control of Cable Sports; Region by Region, Murdoch's Fox Networks Now Rule	Although Rupert Murdoch has an obsession with sports, no one has ever accused him of being a team player. And last week he put on a remarkable individual performance. Even before last week, Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation -- already a power here and overseas in broadcast sports coverage -- had became a dominant force in sports cable television. With a three-year string of investments, he had turned the News Corporation's Fox Entertainment unit into a partial owner of all but four of the nation's 23 regional sports networks -- cable networks that arrange with professional teams to carry all games that are not picked up by national networks or local broadcasters.
1999-03-30	A Day for Baseball and Cigar Lovers	ESPN could not have improved much on its telecast of Sunday's game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban all-stars short of hiring Ted Koppel to be host of a town meeting about the production of deadened baseballs in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan were in loose, midseason form, showing their evident immersion in the game, which Baltimore won, 3-2, in 11 innings. It felt like a typical ESPN Sunday night telecast, largely because the Cuban team was more than competitive, which freed Miller and Morgan from spending downtime spinning tales of the great smuggled Cuban cigars they have smoked.
1999-03-21	The View From/Westport; Play It Again: Choosing the Best Athletes of the Century	MARK SHAPIRO knows who is included on ESPN's list of top-50 North American athletes of the century which is currently being unveiled in a weekly series on the sports network. But Shapiro is not talking. As he strolled through ESPN's 5,400-square-foot studios in Westport, he would not spill the beans because would take away the suspense that is an integral part of the series which broadcasts every Friday at 10:30 P.M. The series will end on Dec. 26 with the disclosure of the top two athletes during a one-hour show on ABC.
1999-02-21	Plot Thickens for America's Cup TV Coverage	It appeared last month that a competing sponsorship deal might force ESPN to drop its plans for televising the 1999-2000 America's Cup races. But the cable sports network now says it has a new contract in the works that would allow the show to go on. What had given ESPN pause was an agreement negotiated by Young America, the New York Yacht Club's cup syndicate, that could potentially flood ESPN's screen with advertising logos on its sails from Fox Sports Net. That sports network is ESPN's staunchest rival in cable television.
1999-02-14	Sports of The Times; Americans Will Get to See What They Missed in '96	IF a wonderful sports event takes place but nobody sees it on television, did it really happen? As a matter of fact, yes, sometimes a game has validity even if it is shunned by the big tube. One of the most glorious parts of the 1996 Summer Games was the American women's gold medal in soccer before huge crowds in collegiate Athens, Ga., far from the grubbiness of downtown Atlanta.
1999-01-25	A Satisfied, Although Intense, Sportscaster	If you watch Keith Olbermann anchor cable's Fox Sports News, you are seeing what appears to be a satisfied sportscaster. This state of mind is somewhat alien to Mr. Olbermann, an intense, impatient one-man psychodrama who left ESPN in a public pique in 1997 to seek happiness in hosting news shows within MSNBC's smaller cable universe, then departed in abject frustration with two years left on his contract when each night's work amounted to discussing the Tao of Monica S. Lewinsky and Kenneth W. Starr for 14 months. Now, as Fox Sports News' $1 million-a-year anchor, Mr. Olbermann has gleefully retraced his steps back to what he did for five years at ESPN's 11 P.M. ''Sports Center''-- delivering sports news like a rascally Dan Rather. A hockey goal is again ''a biscuit in the basket.'' A three-point basketball shot again ends with a ''bang!'' Any reference to the hockey player Scott Niedermayer is punctuated with ''dead!'' -- homage to an ''Animal House'' character.
1999-01-24	Fox Logo on Sail Dimming ESPN America's Cup Deal	It's an America's Cup outcome easy to imagine: the New York Yacht Club's sailing syndicate prevails against 14 challengers in the cup trials. Its sailboat ends up racing New Zealand's defender next February for yachting's oldest trophy. ESPN broadcasts the ocean races for American television from Auckland, New Zealand. The camera lens fills the screen with a view of the two 75-foot yachts and their billowing sails: Team New Zealand and New York's Young America. So what's wrong with this pretty picture?
1999-01-21	ESPN's Newest Adventure	Bass fishing, fly casting, tree chopping, trick-shot archery and rifle shooting will be among the 17 sports in ESPN's Great Outdoor Games, an annual four-day competition that will make its debut in 2000 in Lake Placid, N.Y. ESPN created the event after seeing the success of The X Games and The Winter X Games, which the cable network also owns, as well as the interest by viewers in watching outdoor shows during the weekend on ESPN and ESPN2.
1999-01-17	Sports of The Times; Wilt or Kareem? Chris or Martina?	SPORTS fans, a compulsive lot, love their lists. The other day I found myself standing in front of the rather forlorn-looking N.B.A. store on Fifth Avenue evaluating a montage of the alleged 50 greatest players in National Basketball Association history and saying out loud, ''Jerry Lucas???'' But that's all right. Most people in New York talk to themselves, so nobody noticed.
1998-11-15	November 8-14; Israel Ratifies The Peace Accord	The Israeli Cabinet, after a two-week delay, ratified the Wye peace memorandum almost begrudgingly and with a string of riders attached. But on Thursday, just a day later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened bidding for a large housing development in the predominantly Arab east side of Jerusalem. The move was seen as a gesture to the disaffected right and was denounced by Palestinians.
1998-10-27	Go With the Overflow? An Opening for ESPN	Will Cablevision Systems' newly revealed distaste for creating ''overflow'' channels when two or more teams play games on Fox Sports New York or the MSG Network provide ESPN with the impetus to start a local cable sports channel? Although ESPN views itself as primarily a purveyor of national sports programming, it has tried to enter the regional sports market now dominated by Cablevision, Fox Sports and Liberty Networks through the Fox Sports Net.
1998-10-18	The Mogul; Sly as Fox	Alan Deutschman article on Rupert Murdoch's use of sports as 'battering ram' in drive for global media dominance; photo; latest move is deal with Charles Dolan and John Malone creating Fox Sports Net; 50-50 venture of Fox and Liberty Media will control local television rights to 69 of 75 professional teams in baseball, basketball and hockey; party at Madison Square Garden celebrating coup got little outside attention, but impact is far-reaching triumph for Murdoch over Michael Eisner and Disney, owner of ABC and ESPN (M)
1998-10-18	The Network; The Straw That Stirs the Shtick	It's two hours before show time in the newsroom at ESPN's Bristol, Conn., headquarters, but preparations for the 6:30 P.M. edition of ''SportsCenter'' have accelerated into the broadcast version of the two-minute drill. Production assistants scurry about monitoring the late August afternoon's baseball games, checking on the latest developments in the home-run quest of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Reporters and anchors bang out the copy they'll soon read on the air. Producers work the phones and keep tabs on the news coming over the wire: which basketball star missed his court hearing, which gridiron hero finally ended his holdout, which greedy owner is packing up his team for a sweetheart deal in northern Virginia/North Carolina/New Jersey. Meanwhile, apparently oblivious to the frenzy surrounding them, the ''SportsCenter'' anchors Kenny Mayne and Steve Levy are battling Alexi Lalas and Tab Ramos, two U.S. World Cup soccer players, in a friendly game of Foosball. Mayne and Levy aren't really slacking, they're just the featured performers in the latest round of ''This Is 'SportsCenter''' commercials, a series of frequently hysterical, faux-documentary 15- and 30-second ads promoting ESPN's flagship show -- a thrice-daily sports roundup that has combined standout journalism and stand-up comedy to become the franchise player for the network, itself an all-star performer for its corporate parent, the Walt Disney Company. What began three years ago with an initial 28 spots has become, more than 120 commercials later, one of the most popular and enduring advertising campaigns in recent memory, as witty, nuanced and irreverent as the program it hypes. Full of self-referential, self-mocking in-jokes, the campaign is to sports what ''This Is Spinal Tap'' and ''The Larry Sanders Show'' were to music and show business. ''I think these spots are probably some of the funniest things on TV,'' says Lalas, who in a previous ad lampooned his free-spirit image by passing out flowers to ESPN staff members and strumming ''Michael, Row the Boat Ashore'' on guitar. ''People lose track that it's actually a commercial.''
1998-10-08	Metro Business; An ESPN Sports Bar Is Set for Times Sq.	Disney and its subsidiary, ESPN, the cable sports network, announced plans yesterday to open an upscale sports bar called ESPN Zone in Times Square next summer. The 42,000-square-foot restaurant and bar in the Conde Nast building, at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Broadway, would enlarge Disney's already considerable presence in Times Square, which includes a store and a theater. For ESPN, which has an Internet site and recently began a magazine, the move represents another effort to make its brand name more visible and diversified.
1998-09-30	Playoff a Bonanza for ESPN	ESPN drew its most viewers for a baseball game Monday night when the Cubs' 5-3 victory over the Giants put Chicago in the playoffs. ESPN chalked up an 8.1 Nielsen cable rating, attracting 6.1 million households. In addition, the game was simulcast on WGN-TV in Chicago and KTVU-TV in San Francisco.
1998-09-28	Go Punt, Football; Baseball Is On Throne	Somewhere on television yesterday, football existed. But it hardly mattered -- no, not even on a day when New Orleans won its third straight game -- on a dizzying baseball afternoon when the Mets lost and were eliminated from playoff contention, the Cubs and Giants lost but will meet tonight in a playoff and Mark McGwire slugged his 69th and 70th home runs. And it was all there: the Mets-Braves game played in tandem on Fox Sports New York and ESPN2, which took viewers on a surfer's magical tour from Atlanta to Houston for the 11-inning Cubs-Astros game (where Sammy Sosa got two hits but no home runs beyond his current 66) and to Denver for the Giants-Rockies game.
1998-09-10	A Disney Tie-In With Sears	Sears, Roebuck & Company said today that it would open 100 shops in Sears stores next month with the Walt Disney Company featuring sports clothes and accessories bearing the brand of Disney's ESPN sports television network. Sears and Disney plan to open the shops in the Sears men's sportswear departments.
1998-09-10	Also King of Ratings and the T-Shirts	Mark McGwire's home run quest has been very good to Fox and ESPN. Fox's coverage of McGwire's 62d home run Tuesday night yielded a 12.9 Nielsen rating, drawing 43.1 million viewers and more than doubling last season's average rating for the night's prime-time programming. It was the highest-rated regular-season baseball game since an ABC telecast 16 years ago.
1998-09-08	No. 61 Leaves No Time For Poetry	Mark McGwire slugged his 61st home run with such ferocity yesterday that Jon Miller of ESPN could not muster a classic call. Miller was jolted out of a discussion of Roger Maris's family and the health woes that prevented Maris's widow, Pat, from attending the game when McGwire unleashed. ''That ball is gone if it's fair,'' Miller said, providing the basics. ''It is a home run. No. 61. He has tied Maris.''
1998-08-26	ABC and ESPN Expecting Profit From a 5-Year Deal	ABC and ESPN vowed yesterday to make a profit from a new five- year, $600 million television deal with the National Hockey League that will begin in 1999. Steve Bornstein, president of ESPN and ABC Sports, said he expected to make money because of the cross promotion throughout ESPN and ABC , the Internet and retail outlets that he said will raise ratings and advertising rates.
1998-08-25	ESPN's N.F.L. Passion Grates on Baseball	On Sept. 6, which will be more significant, the Oakland Raiders-Kansas City Chiefs game or the San Francisco Giants-Los Angeles Dodgers game? On Sept. 13, will the Indianapolis Colts-New England Patriots game be more important than the St. Louis Cardinals-Houston Astros game? A week later, will the Philadelphia Eagles-Arizona Cardinals game matter more than the Yankees-Baltimore Orioles game?
1998-08-21	N.H.L. Governors Approve Deal	The National Hockey League Board of Governors has approved a five-year, $600 million ABC-ESPN deal that will start with the 1999-2000 season, and the league is expected to announce the pact next week. A lingering question is whether Fox will try to get out of the final year of its existing five-year deal. Fox had the right to renew the ABC portion of the combined broadcast-cable deal by matching the $250 million price tag.
1998-08-08	With Financiers and Fans, Women's Pool League Civilizes a Hustler's Game	It was 6:30 already, half an hour after the matches were supposed to have started, and the fans were getting antsy. They itched to see behind the blue curtain, into the cordoned-off area of the Amsterdam Billiard Club, where the Black Widow, the Duchess of Doom and the rest of the best female pool players in the world warmed up for the first evening session of the 1998 Brunswick Billiards New York Classic. Hearing the boom of the break, the collisions coming like sporadic cannon fire, was almost too much to take. At last, the velvet rope was whisked aside, and they scurried in, beer-bellied men in Harley-Davidson shirts, junior high school girls with metallic nail polish, Wall Street bankers and senior citizens, all eager to secure seats where they could watch their favorites play nine ball for a slice of a $50,000 pie.
1998-08-07	Best N.H.L. Action Is the Battle Over TV Rights	This has been a good year for Gary Bettman, the National Hockey League commissioner. First, he met the owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning, whom no league official had seen, then he helped engineer the team's sale. And this week, without wishing upon a star, Bettman got a $600 million, five-year offer from the Walt Disney Company to carry the N.H.L. on ABC, ESPN and ESPN2. Now, when you're the recipient of a $120 million-a-year bid -- and your league has been getting an average $45 million annually from Fox and ESPN -- you don't ask Michael Eisner, the chairman of Disney, if he's gone a smidgen goofy.
1998-08-06	ABC and ESPN Make a Dual $600 Million Bid to Acquire N.H.L. Television Rights	Despite falling ratings for National Hockey League telecasts, ABC and ESPN have mounted a combined $600 million bid for broadcast and cable television rights for five years to start in 1999, said executives involved in the talks. At $120 million a year, the bid would represent a stunning 167 percent leap over the average annual rights payment that Fox ($31 million) and ESPN (about $14 million) have been paying. The offer would also double what Fox and ESPN are to pay in the coming season, the last year of their deals.
1998-07-31	Giving Unequal Treatment to the Halls of Fame	The ceremony to induct Mike Singletary, Anthony Munoz, Dwight Stephenson, Paul Krause and Tommy McDonald into the Pro Football Hall of Fame tomorrow will be carried live on ESPN2 from noon to 2 P.M. That's live. For two hours. Last Sunday, the inductions of Don Sutton, Larry Doby and Lee MacPhail into the Baseball Hall of Fame were carried by ESPN2 on tape, for 30 minutes.
1998-07-14	On heels of soccer's World Cup and baseball's All-Star Game, a big pitch begins for the N.F.L.	THE annual advertising offensive to stimulate interest in National Football League games will begin almost two months earlier than usual and involve almost four times as many promotional commercials as before. The fast start and increased exposure for the N.F.L.'s sales pitch are a result of the league's most lucrative contracts ever with the broadcast and cable television networks, covering the 1998-99 season. ABC, CBS, ESPN and Fox will run more than 2,200 N.F.L. spots, which are scheduled to begin appearing tomorrow, in all parts of their schedules, including early morning, daytime and prime time.
1998-07-14	It's a Summer Doubleheader for Babe Ruth Fans	Chris Martens, an ESPN producer, thought Mace Brown, a former Pittsburgh Pirate, was offering him a rare treasure recently. As a rookie pitcher in 1935, Brown witnessed Babe Ruth's last three home runs, slugged in Forbes Field as a Boston Brave. And, Brown told Martens, his wife had filmed the event. ''That's like the Holy Grail,'' Martens said, recalling his anticipation.
1998-07-02	It's a Video Game, It's TV, and You're the Star	ON television, a montage of hockey footage unfurls against the ESPN National Hockey Night musical theme, leading into Dan Patrick and Kenny Mayne making fun of themselves in one of those self-mocking Sports Center commercials. Then you see a screenful of ESPN graphics about the matchup, an exhibition game between the Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche. Cut to Joe Louis Arena, with all the ambient hoopla of a sold-out crowd. The camera pans over the rink from high above as the National Hockey Night anchors, Gary Thorne and Steve Levy, recall a vicious brawl between the teams in the 1996 playoffs. This is a bad-blood matchup. ''The Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche do not like each other,'' Mr. Thorne says. ''Tonight, that battle continues.''
1998-06-19	Disney Joins Rush to Build Web Gateways	The Walt Disney Company joined the nation's biggest media and technology companies yesterday with its own effort to control where people go in cyberspace. Disney announced a complex deal valued at about $900 million in which it will buy 43 percent of Infoseek, a service that helps guide users on the World Wide Web.
1998-06-09	Live From France On World Wide Web	With all 64 games of the World Cup finals being broadcast live in the United States by a combination of ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and the Spanish-language Univision, it will be difficult for a hard-core fan to miss much of the tournament. The competition starts tomorrow in France when Brazil, the defending champion, plays Scotland at 11:30 A.M. Eastern time. And therein is the potential problem: with the six-hour time difference between the East Coast of the United States and France, all of the games will have ended by 5 P.M. Eastern time. So unless you have got your days free, it may be hard to follow the tournament live on television.
1998-06-07	Disney Making a Commitment to Complete Soccer Coverage	This World Cup thing matters at Walt Disney's ABC, ESPN and ESPN2. ''This is the biggest deal on earth,'' said Bob Ley, the event's lead play-by-play announcer, soccer dad and rabid fan since the 1970's. ''We all remember how we felt as Americans in 1980 when the U.S. hockey team defeated the Soviet Union. Every nation can attempt to feel that way during the World Cup. Translate it in those terms -- love of country and love for a beautiful game.''
1998-05-27	TV Notes; Attention, Word Fans	It is an event requiring considerable brain power but no brawn whatsoever, so it might seem a strange event for ESPN. But tomorrow the cable sports network will televise the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee, live from Washington, at 1 P.M. It will be replayed at 7:30 on ESPN2. More than 200 students age 15 or younger will compete. LAWRIE MIFFLIN
1998-05-10	A Fight Over September Games	Major league baseball and ESPN are in a standoff over September games that could land in court. Baseball officials do not want Sunday night games in September shifted to ESPN2 from ESPN, which acquired the full Sunday night package of National Football League games. ''Obviously, we're very concerned,'' said Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner.''The Septmber games are very meaningful to us. We're in the midst of a revival, and these are very important.''
1998-04-28	Now Playing, the Angels (Yet Again)	Does ESPN love the Anaheim Angels too much? Last Wednesday night, ESPN blessed us with the Orioles-Angels game at Anaheim. ESPN followed up on Sunday with the Angels playing the Devils Rays at Tampa Bay. So it seemed peculiar to learn during the telecast that ESPN would return to Anaheim next Sunday for the Angels' game against the White Sox. Counting the May 3 game, ESPN will have carried five Angels games this season, two more than any other team. Jim Edmonds is dandy, I agree, but Anaheim is only 13-10.
1998-04-17	Big ESPN Deal Means Certain Cable Rate Hike	When ESPN decided that it had to acquire the entire Sunday night National Football League package that it used to split with TNT, it elected to escalate its annual rights fee from $131 million to $600 million. How would ESPN pay for $469 million a year in added costs? Certainly, more games mean more advertising to sell. Being able to market an 18-game schedule, not just the final 9 games, might provide additional sales incentives.
1998-04-15	President Leads TV Discussion on Role of Race in Sports	President Clinton switched tonight from national spokesman on issues of race to chief spectator, fading with a pleased smile into the background at an often contentious town hall meeting here as a group of famous athletes and managers argued over race in sports. In a television program that ran past its allotted 90 minutes, President Clinton and a panel of 10 athletes and managers discussed not only the successes of minorities on the field and the court but also their frustrations at persistent stereotypes and at their limited roles in sports management.
1998-04-10	Get Ready for the Battle Of the Network Bat Toys	During last Sunday's Giants-Diamondbacks game on ESPN, Joe Morgan noted that the cable network's newest technical tool had wrongly clocked Ken Griffey Jr.'s bat speed at 106 miles an hour in an earlier game. It was really 97 m.p.h. Morgan could never have made such a correction before, because no one but ESPN had figured out a way to measure bat speed before.
1998-03-20	Race Forum Will Seek New Focus	Hoping to attract more white men to his national dialogue on race, President Clinton will be the host at another town hall meeting on racial issues, this one to be broadcast on ESPN, the cable sport channel, Administration officials said today. The forum will take place in Houston on April 1 and will discuss issues like the lack of hiring of blacks and other minorities as coaches, managers and other positions of authority, as well as stereotyping and conflict and cooperation among the races in sports, said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
1998-03-11	TV Notes; Sports Magazine	Many a television show has sprung from a magazine -- Playboy, National Geographic and Sports Illustrated come to mind. What happens when a television show -- indeed, an entire network -- spawns a magazine? ESPN will offer its answer today, with a new biweekly, ESPN Magazine. Many of its features are adapted directly from television, primarily from ''ESPN Sports Center,'' the cable network's primary news-and-highlights show.
1998-03-11	For New Sports, ESPN Rules as the X-treme Gatekeeper	AS of early January, Mike Nick was an unknown, just a stocky 21-year-old who could do crazy tricks like aerial spins and flips on short, fat planks that resemble miniature snowboards. Then he won the first-ever skiboarding contest at the winter X Games in Crested Butte, Colo., and he was mobbed by reporters. A dozen ringed him slopeside, and the announcer for ESPN -- which produces the X Games and broadcasts the alternative-sports Olympics on its two cable television channels -- informed a million-plus viewers that Nick, a junior at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, was now ''the sensation of rotation.'' You could almost hear the cash registers going ka-ching. Skiboarding, a sport that didn't even exist until 1995, had suddenly become legitimate. Frontside Films, in Santa Monica, Calif., has secured financing to produce ''Skiboarding: The Movie.'' A six-stop professional skiboarding tour has been organized for next year, and Nick's sponsor, Line Skiboards of Albany, N.Y., instantly doubled its production staff.
1998-03-04	Pre-Game Show Expands to 2 Hours	Is two hours too much for a football pre-game show? That used to be the length of Super Bowl pre-game shows, but ESPN, which expanded ''N.F.L. Countdown'' from one hour to 90 minutes in 1995, will stretch it to two hours starting Sept. 6 at 11 A.M.
1998-03-02	Sports magazines are stepping up branding and promotion efforts.	THE Winter Olympics may finally be over, but the competition is still under way in the crowded field of sports magazines. In fact, the activity in the category is intensifying as the Walt Disney Company prepares an entry named after its popular ESPN cable television network. That magazine, scheduled to be introduced next week, has inspired those already in the field to try taking their game, as the saying goes, to the next level.
1998-02-17	A Boost From Disney	For the 12 Major League Soccer teams, it is a small world after all. This year, the league (which begins its third season next month) will have 35 games televised by a combination of ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC, all subsidiaries of the Disney Corporation. The television schedule starts on Saturday, March 21, with Kansas City visiting D.C. United, the two-time defending league champion.
1998-02-08	Extreme Sport, Extreme Chic, Extreme Hype	IT was a moonlight night in January, and the second Winter X Games, developed by ESPN, had just completed Day 1 at this resort town known for its young, free-spirited alternative athletes. After the ice climbing, downhill snow biking and snow-boarding competitions were over, and after the Mountain Dew-drinking contest was over, too, a pack of middle-aged men could be heard howling from the slopes. They were salesmen for Salomon, the ski and sporting-goods company, getting a ride in a snow-grooming tractor. ''You have to have fun to sell fun,'' one said.
1998-01-18	Stay Tuned for the N.F.L. (Gratuitous Violence No Extra Charge)	If you, too, are eager to see Nancy Kerrigan sit knee-to-knee with Tonya Harding and watch Evander Holyfield again lend Mike Tyson his ear, then you will share my gratitude to those television visionaries who last week poured fresh billions into the National Football League. They knew that such reality programming as ''Cops' Greatest Hits'' and ''Funny Fatal Head-On Crashes'' would never replace the blood sports of ice skating, boxing and, most especially, big boys banging into each other.
1998-01-17	Sports of The Times; Golfen Goose Just Got Much Fatter	YOU'D think that everyone would be dancing in the aisles. Four networks -- Fox, ESPN, ABC and CBS -- have agreed to pay the National Football League a phenomenal $18 billion to televise football games over an eight-year span. In the cash and carry business of sports, money is the bottom line. This deal between the networks and the N.F.L. was sure to make everyone scream and shout. The Champagne is flowing at N.F.L. headquarters in Manhattan and in ownership suites round the country.
1998-01-17	How One Network's Urgency Spelled Riches for the N.F.L.	On Jan. 8, Sean McManus left his office at CBS headquarters, walked east on 52d Street and headed for Park Avenue. The president of CBS Sports carried in his leather briefcase a letter he hoped would change the face of a company that four years ago would not pay enough to keep National Football League games and had spent the intervening time regretting it. Losing pro football had decimated CBS's sports programming, eroded its relationship with viewers and advertisers and damaged network morale. So determined was CBS to repair the damage that the letter Mr. McManus carried contained remarkable terms: rich offers for not just one of the N.F.L. programming packages, but for three.
1998-01-16	ABC and ESPN to Show Women's World Cup	For only a few billion dollars less than was paid for the rights to National Football League games, ABC and ESPN yesterday announced a deal to televise all 32 matches of the 1999 Women's World Cup soccer tournament. The third FIFA Women's World Cup will be played at seven sites in the United States from June 19 to July 10, 1999.
1998-01-15	All Those Billions (and It Sounds So Reasonable)	Who's nuts now? Four years ago when Fox overturned the sports economy by paying $1.58 billion to get into the National Football League, many snickered at the insolence and imprudence of Rupert Murdoch's broadcast weblet. They wondered if Bart Simpson would diagram plays with a crayon. But the expectations of folly never came true. If Murdoch -- who did have to write off $350 million in losses early on -- was deemed harebrained, how do we judge what happened this week: CBS signed on to pay $4 billion to get back into pro football; Disney committed $4.4 billion to keep ''Monday Night Football'' on ABC (ousting NBC from the N.F.L.) and $4.8 billion to put the entire Sunday night cable package on ESPN (kicking TNT out), and Fox agreed to spend $4.4 billion to keep what it had.
1998-01-15	The N.F.L.'s Windfall Can Benefit Owners, Players and Fans	It is as if the goal posts at either end of the field had been replaced by giant curvy dollar signs, as if the hash marks were now cent marks, as if the whistle ending each play sounded like a loud, trendy ''ka-ching,'' the newest way to signify cash earned and deposited. The National Football League's new eight-year, $17.6 billion deal with three television networks -- more than twice the yearly value of the previous contract -- had the pro football community counting its blessings and adding its dollars yesterday.
1998-01-15	Monday Night Testosterone	The numbers are certainly astonishing, but the first word that pops to mind is not ''Wow!'' but ''Why?'' Four networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox and ESPN -- have agreed to pay the National Football League $18 billion over eight years, about double the current price, for the right to televise professional football. That works out to something like $35 million per game, including the playoffs. As in football, there were winners and losers. CBS, which sat morosely on the sidelines for four years, outbid NBC for the rights to broadcast games played by the N.F.L.'s American Conference. NBC then challenged ABC for the Monday night games and lost. NBC will now ride the bench. Even so, its avid pursuit of the Monday night franchise suggested that, like the other networks, it regards football as an investment of talismanic importance.
1998-01-14	Monday Football Stays on ABC; NBC Out of Game After 33 Years	In a dramatic finale to the most expensive sports television negotiations ever, ABC yesterday kept ''Monday Night Football'' for $4.4 billion over eight years, and ESPN secured exclusive National Football League cable rights by paying $4.8 billion for the entire Sunday night package. The financial commitments by ABC and ESPN, both subsidiaries of the Walt Disney Company, swept NBC from professional football after 33 seasons. They also ended the eight-year arrangement under which ESPN had shared Sunday night games with TNT.
1998-01-12	Networks And N.F.L. Near Deals	In negotiations that are expected to end this week, the National Football League is seeking eight-year deals with its television partners, according to participants in the talks who insisted they not be identified. Only the league would have the option of opening up the contract during the deal, which it could exercise to get more money if the advertising market gets better than it already is. In an economic downturn, the league could choose not to exercise the option, providing teams with financial security.
1997-12-17	ESPN Sportscaster Pleads No Contest	Gary Miller, a sports broadcaster for ESPN, pleaded no contest yesterday in Cleveland to disorderly conduct for urinating from a second-floor window on two off-duty police officers working at a nightclub. He was arrested Oct. 11 while in Cleveland for the American League Championship Series.
1997-11-18	ESPN on Mark to Last Pick for Expansion Draft	On Oct. 10, 1961, officials of the Mets and the Houston Colt .45's gathered in the Netherland-Hilton Hotel in Cincinnati -- the city where the former National League president, Warren Giles, kept his office. The occasion was the league's expansion draft. There was no live television coverage, no ESPN and no news media horde. As their first picks, the Mets chose Hobie Landrith, and Houston took Eddie Bressoud (and quickly traded him to the Red Sox for Don Buddin). The talent didn't improve much after that. Neither team burst with pennant-bound prowess after spending $1.85 million each.
1997-11-13	N.F.L. Takes Notice Of N.B.A.'s TV Deals	The National Basketball Association signed deals with NBC and Turner Sports on Tuesday that will increase TV rights payments by 140 percent to $2.64 billion through the next four seasons. Can the National Football League expect a similar leap when its network negotiations begin next month? ''It will have no direct effect on our negotiations,'' Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L.'s commissioner, said yesterday at a law forum in Manhattan. ''It's a great set of contracts for them. It shows the strength of the N.B.A. We're each dealing with different television realities. We'll do well.''
1997-10-12	ESPN Host Arrested	Gary Miller, a host of ESPN's ''Baseball Tonight,'' was arrested yesterday and charged with urinating out the window of a Cleveland nightclub onto off-duty police officers. Miller, 40, of Branford, Conn., was arrested at about 1:30 A.M. at the Basement, a popular dance club in Cleveland's Flats neighborhood. He was charged with public indecency, aggravated disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Police Sgt. Mark Hastings said.
1997-09-28	The Nation; Sports Networks Ready to Rumble	ALL politics is local, Tip O'Neill used to say. But what would that diehard Red Sox fan have said of sports? Given the loyalty that sports fans in Boston and other cities have for their hometown teams, one might conclude that sports, too, is basically a local affair. But professional sports also creates genuinely national heroes like Tiger Woods. Even a perennially winning team, like the Chicago Bulls, can generate a national following. Whether sports is a local or national phenomenon is more than grist for a slow night on WFAN talk radio. The issue is at the heart of an epic battle for supremacy in TV sports. The combatants are two vast media companies, Walt Disney and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, both of which are known for creating entertainment icons like Mickey Mouse and Bart Simpson that defy any sense of local identity. Now those companies are fixing their
1997-09-09	Super Bowl III Revisited, on ESPN	In 1969 Steve Sabol produced a 22-minute review of Super Bowl III for NFL Films. In his pro-National Football League stance, Sabol focused more on the sore-armed Johnny Unitas's valiant effort to rally Baltimore than on how the Jets made good on Joe Namath's victory guarantee and beat the Colts, 16-7. Sabol, the president of NFL Films, confessed: ''It was a cinematic triumph, but as a sports documentary, it was a disaster. I was so biased toward the Colts that I didn't use the good Jets stuff.''
1997-09-01	Broadcast Giants Vie for Control of Regional Sports Markets	Two months ago, Fox Sports Detroit did not exist. The only regional sports channel available to 1.6 million cable homes in Michigan and northern Ohio was Pro-Am Sports Systems, or PASS, a subsidiary of the Washington Post Company. But now, Fox Sports Detroit owns all future rights to the cream of PASS's sports programming: baseball's Tigers, basketball's Pistons and hockey's Red Wings, the reigning Stanley Cup champions of the National Hockey League.
1997-08-31	Bristol Rubs ESPN's Egos Wrong Way	AT ESPN headquarters here, ''The Fabulous Sports Babe,'' a radio talk show host, used to announce that she was broadcasting out of ''a trailer in the woods.'' Another sportscaster called it odd that ''ESPN, 'the Worldwide Leader in Sports,' is located in the least media-conscious place on the East Coast.'' And the star ESPN anchor, Keith Olbermann, before following the ''Babe's'' lead this summer to a state with a subway system, answered ''Bristol,'' when asked on a Comedy Central show to name ''the most Godforsaken'' spot in the East.
1997-08-12	Catcher-Cam Gives Reasons to Yell 'Action'	In the 1950's, the center-field camera revolutionized how we watch baseball, putting a lens on the catcher signaling the pitcher, the batter's stance and the flight of the ball. Now that revolution has been accelerated with the advent of tiny cameras affixed to catchers' masks. As a 1990's television innovation, it matches the cameras inside hockey goals that offer an unparalleled look at approaching power plays.
1997-08-12	Cable Networks Back Nielsen Rival	Four cable television networks have become the first to say they will support a national television audience measurement system that is meant to compete against Nielsen Media Research. The newcomer, Systems for Measuring and Reporting Television, or Smart, had previously drawn support from broadcast networks. The four cable supporters are Discovery Networks, a unit of Discovery Communications; ESPN, owned by the Walt Disney Company; USA Networks, a joint venture of units of the Seagram Company and Viacom Inc., and Lifetime Television, owned by the Hearst Corporation and Disney. Nielsen is a unit of the Cognizant Corporation.
1997-07-02	Jackson Signs as ESPN Analyst	REGGIE JACKSON needs a public forum to discuss baseball, one that he hopes will lead to running a major league baseball team. So he has signed with ESPN to be an occasional analyst for its baseball coverage, starting Friday at 10 P.M. ''I need ESPN to express to people that I want to be more in the game and more closely associated with it,'' said Jackson, who has called baseball for ABC Sports and was a commentator for Angels and Athletics games. Jackson, a special adviser to the Yankees since 1993, needed permission from the team owner, GEORGE STEINBRENNER, to go to ESPN.
1997-06-23	Young Athletes Put Their Spin on What Sport Should Be	On Saturday, the first day of summer, blue skies, sparkling water and 30,000 wild and crazy fans formed the backdrop of a production here that is on the verge of becoming this generation's Olympics. It is called the X Games, ESPN's three-year-old invention for those twenty-somethings known as Generation X. ''We are already bigger than most athletes in the Olympics,'' said Tony Hawk, 29, a skateboarder and owner of a skateboard company in Huntington Beach, Calif. ''We already have the integrity.''
1997-06-21	Olbermann Poised to Join NBC	KEITH OLBERMANN, who is leaving ESPN's ''SportsCenter'' on June 29, is expected to join NBC News on Monday in a deal that would most likely place him with MSNBC, the cable network that is half-owned by NBC. The agreement, which has not been completed, might allow Olbermann to contribute to NBC's news and sports divisions. ''This is as broad as it can be,'' said JEAN SAGE, Olbermann's agent.
1997-06-18	Olbermann Leaving ESPN	Keith Olbermann, the witty, wisecracking anchor on ESPN's ''SportsCenter,'' will make his last appearance on the program on June 29, cutting short his contract by six months, according to people familiar with the situation. An ESPN spokesman could not confirm that Olbermann is leaving.
1997-05-29	Restraining Order Is Sought Against ESPN's 'X Games'	The National Audubon Society charged in a lawsuit filed Tuesday that staging ESPN's ''X Games'' event next month on a man-made San Diego peninsula may damage a colony of endangered birds during their breeding and nesting cycle. In a suit against ESPN and the City of San Diego in State Superior Court in California, the conservation group asked for a temporary restraining order against the ''X Games'' until the city studies the environmental effect that the increasingly popular extreme sports extravaganza may have on the endangered California least tern and the threatened Western snowy plover.
1997-05-09	Olbermann Still Visible Despite a Forced Exile	Keith Olbermann yesterday marked his ninth day of involuntary exile from ESPN's ''Sportscenter'' for a rap sheet of alleged naughtiness against the network that culminated on April 16, when he appeared on Comedy Central's ''The Daily Show'' without ESPN's say-so. Olbermann probably irked ESPN further by informing Craig Kilborn, the host, that Bristol, Conn., the bustling capital of the ESPN empire, was the most godforsaken place on earth. Such impudence! Why hasn't Boston Market dumped Olbermann as its spokesman and stripped him of his Chicken Carver rights?
1997-05-07	ESPN Punishes Olbermann	KEITH OLBERMANN's absence since last week from ESPN's ''Sportscenter'' can now be explained: management ordered him off for two weeks, partly to punish him for promoting his new book last month on Comedy Central's program ''The Daily Show,'' whose host, CRAIG KILBORN, formerly worked on ''Sportscenter.'' ''I'm told it's not a suspension or a vacation, and he's getting paid,'' said JEAN SAGE, Olbermann's agent. ''ESPN has taken the position that nobody can do outside activities without permission. Keith did not get permission, but they knew he'd be going on other shows to publicize his book.''
1997-02-28	A Hard-Hitting Profile Of Robinson by ESPN	The subject merits 120 minutes, but ''Breaking the Line: The Legacy of Jackie Robinson'' on ESPN tonight at 8:30 lasts but an hour. That is its sole flaw. It is not a warm, emotional biography like the elegant documentary on Robinson that ESPN ran last year as part of a five-part Brooklyn Dodger series produced by Mark Reese, the son of the former Brooklyn shortstop Pee Wee Reese.
1997-02-07	All-Stars and ESPY's Going Heavy on Hoopla	Excess. Get ready for it, from the programming surrounding Sunday night's National Basketball Association All-Star Game to the hoo-ha attending ESPN's Monday night telecast of its self-important ESPY Awards. First, the All-Star Game. Today and tomorrow, TNT will televise eight and a half hours of N.B.A. programming, including tomorrow night's slam-dunk event, rookie game, and shootout and million-dollar shot contests from 7:30-10:30 P.M.
1996-12-10	Report Says Grambling Forcing Robinson Out	EDDIE ROBINSON, college football's winningest coach, has been told by Grambling that he must quit as coach, ESPN reported yesterday. The cable network cited unidentified sources as saying Robinson, 77, must either resign or take a vice president's position at the school, where he has been the head coach for 55 years.
1996-10-28	Still going after laughs, ESPN decides that it hasn't heard enough of Robert Goulet's baritone.	MORE people than ever are hearing Robert Goulet's booming baritone. But they aren't listening to songs of love and legend from ''South Pacific'' or ''Man of La Mancha.'' Now the 62-year-old troubadour is swinging with nutty ditties for 18- to 25-year-olds to promote ESPN's college basketball schedule. This is the second year that Mr. Goulet has warbled for ESPN. When the cable network's agency, Weiden & Kennedy, wanted a retro celebrity last season, it picked Mr. Goulet. Ernest Lupinacci, the copywriter -- a devotee of older music, Rat Pack repartee and the Goulet oeuvre -- suggested him.
1996-10-04	NBC Says It Lost Chance To Broadcast the Yankees	Major League Baseball yesterday refused to back down to an NBC Sports claim that it was assured the right to broadcast Game 4 of the Yankees-Texas playoff series in prime time, switching it from an ESPN afternoon telecast. ''They did not have a deal,'' said Rich Levin, a baseball spokesman.
1996-08-25	Dem Bums	The mystique of Ebbets Field remains long after its team abandoned it to the wrecking ball. A new five-part series, THE ORIGINAL AMERICA'S TEAM: THE BROOKLYN DODGERS, returns to Ebbets Field in its final glory days. The documentary profiles Pee Wee Reese (right), the legendary shortstop; Jackie Robinson (left), first black man in the 20th-century majors; Roy Campanella, the M.V.P. catcher, and Duke Snider, the Jewel of Flatbush. The last part is an analysis of the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles and its longterm effects on sports. Reese's son, Mark, who wrote and directed the series, provides viewers access to archives, interviews, anecdotes and home movies - beginning TUESDAY at 7:30 P.M. on ESPN.
1996-08-07	Where Will Howard Play Next Season?	JUWAN HOWARD's saga continued yesterday, with conflicting reports about his status. A National Basketball Association spokesman said an arbitration hearing was still scheduled to decide which team Howard would play for next season -- the Miami Heat, or the Washington Bullets. But ESPN reported yesterday that the Heat had dropped its efforts to sign the 6-foot-9-inch Howard, and that the forward would play for the Bullets next season. Howard has signed contracts with both teams. He signed a seven-year, $100.8 million contract with Miami last month, but the N.B.A. rejected that deal, saying the Heat exceeded the salary cap to sign Howard.
1996-06-28	An Odd, Fictional Clan In ESPN's Newest Ads	"Meet the happy ESPN family: the sons, Chris Berman, Tom Jackson, Joe Theismann, Chris Mortensen and Sterling Sharpe, the stars of ""N.F.L. Countdown."" And their dad, Harry Dean Stanton, star of the movie, ""Repo Man."" The advertising agency Wieden & Kennedy conceived the idea for a new promotional campaign for the 90-minute Sunday morning ""Countdown"" -- formerly ""N.F.L. Gameday"" -- that begins this fall. Last season, Art Donovan laughed and ate his way through a series of jocular ads. This year, it is Stanton, 69, a Ph.D. in Hollywood menace and desperation."
1996-06-21	The X Games: Going to extremes in an effort to tap a growing segment of sports	"HERE's ""Generation X"" and ""The X-Files,"" ""Madame X"" and X marks the spot. Now, ESPN Inc. hopes to add one more name to that list: the X Games. The second annual installment of the event, which will run from Monday through June 30 on the ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN International cable television networks, is, to paraphrase an advertising slogan, not your father's Olympics. Rather, the 35 1/2 hours of contests are intended as a showcase for the new so-called extreme sports -- ""sheer unadulterated athletic lunacy,"" as they are billed in the X Games promotional campaign by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. -- like sky surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and even bungee jumping."
1996-06-11	The Newest Approach: All the Sports News But None of the Games	"Four months ago, CNN and Sports Illustrated announced the creation of CNN/SI, a 24-hour all-news sports network. The notion of a service devoted solely to news and assorted blather -- without any games -- seemed audacious but flaky. You wonder if there are enough viewers, advertisers, talking heads or ""news"" to make round-the-clock sports news viable, when there are no games on the roster. Will ""Ben-Gay's Disabled List Tonight"" become must-see TV? Will enough Craig Kilborn clones be created to stock one or even two such channels?"
1996-05-24	Who Will Take Checkered Flag in Ratings Race?	"When 2 P.M. tolls on Sunday, will the Indianapolis 500 maintain its ratings strength on ABC as it did last year, or will a couple million racing fans switch to the upstart U.S. 500 on ESPN with all the top drivers on display? ""No one, not even the experts, knows what to expect,"" said Danny Sullivan, who won the Indy 500 in 1985 and will analyze its 80th running for ABC. ""No one knows if it will be exciting, safe or if a lot of guys will finish. If we have a boring race, people may switch. If I were home, I'd watch on two TV's."""
1996-04-11	ABC's Swanson Retires	"DENNIS SWANSON, who succeeded ROONE ARLEDGE as the president of ABC Sports in 1986, retired yesterday, effective May 4. As part of a restructuring, ABC Sports will now report to STEVE BORNSTEIN, the president of ESPN. The restructuring has been expected since last summer when the Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC, which owns 80 percent of ESPN. ""We have long felt that the two divisions need to have a closer relationship to help coordinate their goals and activities,"" said ROBERT IGER, president of Capital Cities/ABC. ""Their external contacts are frequently the same; they often share television rights, and they sometimes split functions."""
1996-04-05	Fox Baseball Coverage Is Sure to Include Some Curveballs	Fox's buildup to starting its five-year, $575 million baseball television contract mimics what it did for football and hockey: a blizzard of advertising, the hiring of many new faces to announce the games and the promise of innovation. Resurrecting the ratings of the oft-maligned Saturday afternoon Game of the Week on June 1 this year (and from the season's start next year) is Fox's daunting programming task. Of course, ESPN believes that it has, since 1990, revived the old Game of the Week tradition with its Sunday night games. ESPN's Jon Miller-Joe Morgan team is arguably the best doing the game today.
1996-03-24	ESPN2 Adjusts Course Without Dipping Below 200 M.P.H.	"IT's 10:20 ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT, and Julie Mariash is nervously waiting for a highlight tape. ESPN2's ""N.H.L. 2Night"" is going on in 20 seconds, and Ms. Mariash, the show's producer, wants to open with tape from a just-completed game between Tampa Bay and Toronto. Her audience, she explains, is composed of hockey fans who will want to know about this game first because its outcome will have a critical effect on the National Hockey League standings. The digital clock in the control room shows 10 seconds to air time. Ms. Mariash looks up at it, shrugs and tells the show's co-hosts, Bill Pidto and the former Los Angeles Kings coach Barry Melrose, to open with highlights of another, less interesting game. Suddenly, an ESPN2 staff member arrives with the Tampa Bay tape, and Ms. Mariash smiles as the show begins. ""Tampa Bay, Toronto,"" Mr. Pidto says in an excited baritone as a picture of Tampa Bay's goalie, Daren Puppa, flashes on the screen. ""And there's Daren Puppa . . . Scoopa!"""
1995-11-07	Billion-Dollar Bonus Baby: Networks Ante Up	"Major League Baseball shed its characteristic business gloom yesterday by announcing a five-year package of national television deals with Fox, NBC, ESPN and Liberty Sports that will be worth about $1.68 billion through 2000. ""The number changed constantly, almost daily,"" said Barry Frank, baseball's chief negotiator."
1995-10-31	2 Media Giants Seen Forming A Rival to ESPN	In an effort to become major competitors to ESPN, Tele-Communications Inc. and the News Corporation are negotiating the formation of a new global sports network, two people with knowledge of the discussions said yesterday. The cable service, which could be announced as early as this week, would be run by the News Corporation and Liberty Media, the programming arm of Tele-Communications. Liberty owns a number of regional sports cable services that could provide programming for the service. The News Corporation, led by Rupert Murdoch, has been aggressively acquiring sports rights in the United States and overseas.
1995-10-20	Sportscaster Honors	AL MICHAELS of ABC and CHRIS BERMAN of ESPN were voted sportscasters of the year, the American Sportscasters Association announced yesterday. Michaels was honored as a play-by-play broadcaster and Berman as a studio host.
1995-09-08	Numb and Numbers: 2,131 and Counting	For all his endurance, grit, humility, modesty, charity, patience, and indoor gym, Cal Ripken Jr.'s achievement comes down to a number: 2,131-plus. And ESPN's telecast of the Steely Eyed Shortstop's record-setting game against the California Angels Wednesday night produced some interesting numbers. (All statistics were calculated from the start of the telecast to game's end.) TOTAL RIPKEN ON-AIR SIGHTINGS: 214
1995-08-06	The Trophy In Eisner's Big Deal	"WHEN he announced the $19 billion acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC last Monday, Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, expressed boundless enthusiasm for his newest, globally popular attraction, an asset that he called ""a magic name"" comparable as a brand to Coca-Cola and Kodak: ESPN. As he moved from the news conference announcing the stunning acquisition to interviews with newspapers, magazines, CNN's ""Larry King Live"" and ABC's ""Nightline,"" Mr. Eisner reserved most of his evident delight in the second largest takeover in United States history for the vast possibilities that he foresaw from the combination of ""Disney imagineering"" with the global brand identity of ESPN, the all-sports cable channel begun by Getty Oil in 1979."
1995-06-30	Most Exciting Part Of Extreme Games Is Extreme Coverage	Are ESPN's Extreme Games bad for America? The weeklong psycho Olympics that ends tomorrow ain't gangsta rap, and it ain't a Time Warner production. So it's safe. To watch. How else could I have spent six hours scrambling eggs, running over turtles, tidying the bowl, barefooting like Banana George, contracting road rash on my tummy, getting squirrelly in my tumble turn and doing a Judo McTwist? I urged my cat not to follow my reckless lead. I don't know if the Extreme Games presage the fall of Western Civilization. But after the mindless slaughter of trees to produce Extreme Games press kits, I had to get the vicarious buzz caused by 45 hours of extreme TV. It was like rubbernecking to watch an accident on the Cross Bronx Expressway.
1995-06-29	Sharpe Is Joining ESPN	"STERLING SHARPE expects to miss at least the 1995 season, so the wide receiver will spend the year in the broadcast booth instead. Sharpe has joined ESPN as an analyst. ""Football is my first love, but if I can't play again, ESPN will keep me close to the field and in the action,"" Sharpe said."
1995-06-23	ESPN and Fox Clash in the Other Cup Face-Off	The Devils have proved superior to the Red Wings through the first two games of the Stanley Cup finals. But which network has been better, Fox or ESPN? Who's the better play-by-play announcer, Fox's Mike Emrick or ESPN's Gary Thorne? Which network manages its corner clock with more care? Which one gives the best information? Who is more daring with its production toys? PLAY BY PLAY Emrick is Vin Scully on skates, a tenor who makes calling hockey like singing an aria. His greatest skill is weaving a near-radio call of action with player biographies, anecdotes and rules, while maintaining a 60-minute peak of excitement. Thorne is more playful, more workmanlike and owns a commanding voice. But he's not hockey's Pavarotti. EDGE Fox.
1995-06-16	Miller's Job Is to Talk a Good Game	"Ninety seconds before NBC's Dick Enberg and Johnny Miller went on the air for ESPN yesterday with the United States Open, Miller turned to Enberg, a veteran of many sports but a rookie on golf. ""Man of many partners,"" Miller said, ""you're not monogamous."""
1995-03-28	Olbermann Puts His Serious Side on the Shelf	"Keith Olbermann, ESPN's black-belt wiseacre and chief nasty boy, hates replacement baseball, detests those who may play it come opening day Sunday, and makes clear that he will mock, mock, mock, till the major leaguers return. ""It's a post-apocalyptic nuclear vision of baseball,"" he said."
1995-03-22	Here's One Fight That Certainly Won't Air on ESPN	"The Phil Simms-ESPN donnybrook continued yesterday as the former Giant quarterback's agent said ESPN's negotiating tactics forced Simms into NBC's embrace. Simms, who never signed his two-year ESPN contract, signed a three-year contract with NBC on Sunday worth at least $400,000 a year. ""ESPN is acting like a spurned woman,"" said David Fishof, Simms's agent, who said angry comments by Steve Bornstein, ESPN's president, about Simms's allegedly bad-faith behavior, ""can't ruin Phil Simms's reputation."""
1994-12-08	March Madness for Women On ESPN Basketball Scene	"ESPN will televise 23 games of the women's Division I basketball tournament starting in 1996 as part of a new seven-year, $19 million deal to show nearly a score of National Collegiate Athletic Association championships. ""We can take the women's tournament to an entirely new level,"" John Wildhack, ESPN's senior vice president of programming, said after the contract was announced yesterday."
1994-11-08	ESPN Plans To Purchase Sports Wire	ESPN expanded its sports-information domain yesterday by agreeing to acquire 80 percent of Sports Ticker, a sports-wire news service, from Dow Jones & Company. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Sports Ticker, based in Jersey City, transmits scores, statistics, news and features to radio and television stations, news wire services and newspapers like USA Today, The Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore Sun. It provides information for professional sports teams and restaurants that display it on electronic sign boards.
1994-07-03	TV Sports Without End In Cruise Ship Cabins	As television continues to make wider inroads into cruise ship cabins, passengers on the ships of at least six lines can now tune in to the 24-hour programming of ESPN. The sports network, which has added the ships as subscribers in recent months, distributes internationally the Super Bowl, the World Series, the Stanley Cup, the Davis Cup and the British Open in addition to regular-season games, daily scores, interviews and highlights. The lines offering ESPN include Celebrity, Crystal, Gold Star, Norwegian, Premier and Princess.
1994-06-28	Fast? Furious? Chess, ESPN Style	Alexey Vyzmanavin and Pedrag Nikolic, grandmasters in the world of chess, sat facing each other on either side of a tiny table and arm-wrestled with their minds. Now and then one would deftly move a rook or a pawn, but beyond that, most of the action consisted of back-arching, face-rubbing and, once, Mr. Nikolic pulled an ear, his own. Chess, a sport in which commentators interpret a repositioning of a player's feet on the carpet as a change in momentum, may not appear exciting from the outside. The action is in the mind, where the board becomes a field of combat, where armies attack, flank, defend, retreat, and kill the wounded.
1994-06-03	Staying Impartial Isn't Easy	In the crowded broadcast booth during Game 1 of the Rangers-Canucks series Tuesday night, three television cameras -- from the MSG Network, ESPN and Canada's CBC -- followed the action in unison, tracking smoothly, then staccato, then smoothly again, in coordinated search of the puck on the Madison Square Garden ice. The MSG team of John Davidson and Sam Rosen was perched in the left corner of the booth, the ESPN crew of Gary Thorne and Bill Clement in the right.
1994-04-05	In Cyberspace, a High-Tech League of Their Own	Ah, the opening of the baseball season. The crack of the bat! The roar of the crowd! The whistle of modems! Holy Cow, sports fans, baseball has come to cyberspace. Baseball, whether the real game or the increasingly popular form of fantasy baseball called Rotisserie, has become a showcase for the slugging power of technology and information networks. For a fee, fans of the game can now tap into vast information data bases where millions of bits of baseball news, esoterica and analysis are stored, dissected and disseminated, pitch by pitch, minute by minute.
1994-03-30	ESPN and Prodigy Offering Sports Information Service	The ESPN sports television network and the Prodigy information network, the country's biggest players in cable television programming and on-line computer services, respectively, are teaming to create an interactive sports information service accessible through personal computers. The new service, called ESPNET, is to be announced today at a news conference at Madison Square Garden and will be available tomorrowthrough the Prodigy network.
1994-03-17	As the Boss Goes, So Goes the Secretary: Is It Bias?	Women in professional jobs have workplace issues like the glass ceiling and the mommy track. But now there is one for secretaries: rug-ranking.
1994-03-16	U.S. Pro League Moves Along By Signing a Television Deal	Major League Soccer, the legacy of the World Cup's being awarded to the United States, yesterday announced three-year television deals with ESPN and ABC. When the 12-team league starts play in April 1995, ESPN will televise 10 games, ESPN2 will air 25 games and ABC will broadcast the championship game.
1994-01-07	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; In a campaign to build its 'brand character,' ESPN is playing a provocative new game.	IN the fledgling realm of cable television, ESPN, which began presenting its sports programming in 1979, is the equivalent of a venerable consumer product brand like Ivory soap, Good & Plenty candy or Fig Newtons. ESPN is America's largest cable network, reaching 63.1 million homes. But with the television universe becoming increasingly fragmented -- one can almost hear the couch potatoes wondering what's on Channel 343 tonight -- even ESPN must develop methods to burnish its brand identity among viewers and advertisers.
1993-12-19	Sports of The Times; A World Cup Mystery: The Strange Case of the Missing Pele	"IF you stopped the average American on the street and asked for a quickie opinion of soccer, quite likely it would be something like this: ""It's that sneaky furrin sport where they all have funny names and do creepy things with their feet and their forehead instead of the good old-fashioned way with their hands like Bill Laimbeer and Mike Tyson and all those honorable hockey goons. We don't like them slippery foot-fetish types in our country."" And if you really pushed our average American to name just one soccer player, quite likely the answer would be: ""Yeah, well, old Pele, he was a great player, from what I hear."""
1993-11-12	On Stage, and Off	"Hard to Get a Date With nine Broadway openings this month (more than in any fall month since November 1981) and a dozen more Off Broadway, this is the New York theater's most hectic stretch in memory. It is a circumstance that was thrown into sharp relief last week when the producers of ""Perestroika,"" Part 2 of ""Angels in America,"" announced they were postponing its opening from Thursday, Nov. 18, until the following Tuesday, thus upsetting what had been a rather precariously balanced schedule. Producers of Broadway shows are required to register their opening nights with the League of American Theaters and Producers, reserving the dates as long in advance as possible so that the league can orchestrate schedules and keep conflicts to a minimum. Less officially but for the convenience of all, the league has for the last few years also kept track of Off Broadway openings, but the Off Broadway theaters all understand that they are somewhat at the mercy of Broadway shows, which take precedence. Indeed, weeks ago, when ""Perestroika"" first assumed the Nov. 18 date, it bumped the Manhattan Theater Club's production of Donald Margulies's play ""The Loman Family Picnic."" The theater then moved ""Loman"" to Nov. 23, where last Friday it found itself under the feet of ""Angels"" once again."
1993-07-15	A Network Says Baseball Ignores Its Cable Offer	"ESPN is expected to retain cable rights to major league baseball for $40 million to $45 million a year, but officials of Prime SportsChannel Networks said yesterday that they were willing to pay baseball more but have been ignored. ""This hasn't been a serious negotiation,"" said Peter Barton, president of Liberty Media, the programming spinoff of Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable company. Liberty is part of the ownership team that merged Prime Network with SportsChannel early this year."
1993-07-01	Majors Negotiating TV Deal	"Major league baseball, which created a joint venture with NBC and ABC for network broadcasts starting next season, is negotiating with ESPN and Prime SportsChannels for a new cable deal to succeed the current ESPN agreement. An agreement ""is probably two weeks away,"" said Bill Giles, the owner of the Philadelphia Phillies and a member of baseball's television committee. ""If we can't do a deal with ESPN, we might end up with Liberty."""
1993-06-26	ESPN Adding Channel and Attitude	If the sheer volume of sports on television has reached the saturation point, Steve Bornstein will not acknowledge it. The president of ESPN Inc. is so confident of the continued insatiability of sports viewers that he has aggressively expanded the cable sports network's breadth overseas, entered the pay-per-view realm and signed a joint venture with Sony to make home videos. And in the biggest gamble since ESPN's debut in 1979, Mr. Bornstein will test how much more action and information viewers can take starting Nov. 2, with the introduction of the youth-oriented ESPN2. Thus, ESPN, once ridiculed for showing sports 24 hours a day, will soon bring 48 hours of sports a day into America's living rooms.
1993-06-17	ESPN to Carry America's Cup	ESPN acquired the domestic and worldwide TV rights to the 1995 America's Cup yesterday, the fourth time it will carry the regatta. Coverage will include the Defender Series Finals in April and the America's Cup Match in May. Two United States syndicates -- one led by Dennis Conner, the other by John Marshall -- have announced plans to enter the Defender Series.
1993-06-08	ESPN Going Into Overtime	ESPN yesterday unveiled ESPN2, a 24-hour sports network that will go on the air Nov. 2 and will offer a mixture of news and information, live events and programming aimed at viewers between the ages of 18 and 34. ESPN appeals mainly to the 25-54 age group. ESPN2 will show up to three nights a week of National Hockey League games, and will feature college basketball, arena football, volleyball and extreme sports like sky-surfing. The cornerstone program will be SportsNight, a news and highlights show to air Friday-Monday, from 8-11 P.M.
1993-06-07	New ESPN Network	"ESPN, the all-sports cable television network, is planning a new sports network aimed at younger audiences. The company, based in Bristol, Conn., will provide details today. Tentatively called ESPN 2, the network ""will consist of casual sports and be geared toward younger demographics,"" Ron Tobias, a company spokesman, said."
1993-06-05	ESPN 2 Ready For Prime Time	ESPN will unveil on Monday the full details of ESPN 2, a second cable sports network designed to be heavy on sports news, to appeal to a young audience and to be the home of National Hockey League games. ESPN 2, which will debut in the fall, has been in the works for some time. Its formal unveiling has been delayed while the company spent considerable time working out agreements with cable systems to carry the service.
1993-04-01	ESPN Joins Pay-Per-View	ESPN is expanding into pay-per-view starting in September with college football in partnership with ABC, which inaugurated the effort last fall with Showtime Event Television as its distributor and marketer. The modestly successful 11-week football series supplemented the regional game each market received on Saturday from its local ABC station with games from other areas produced by ABC that could be bought on their cable system.
1993-02-26	Sunday Night Taped, With Bill Murray	"ESPN is making sporting use of Bill Murray, the insouciant comedy star and celebrated dancer of the Pebble Beach Sand Trap Tango. Murray will discuss golf and baseball Sunday night on ""SportsCenter,"" but more importantly, he will be a presenter and performer March 4 for the cable network's first ESPY Awards, for excellence in athletic performance. Thirty-three awards voted upon by fans will be handed out by such diverse stars as Dustin Hoffman, Mariel Hemingway and Tim McCarver. Dennis Miller will be the host for the show, which airs from 9 to 11:30 P.M., Eastern time."
1992-11-19	Valvano Returns to Broadcasting	"Five months after being diagnosed with cancer, the college basketball analyst JIM VALVANO returns to ESPN tomorrow night a more overtly spiritual person who vowed to spend considerable time raising money for cancer research. ""When I stand up on Friday night at Florida State, there will be a lot of tears,"" he said during a conference call. ""I cry a lot now. If you thought I was emotional before, well, I might cry at a great 3-point play now."""
1992-11-01	Valvano Back on Air	JIM VALVANO, the former North Carolina State coach who has been under treatment for cancer, apparently feels well enough to resume his career as a college television analyst. A spokesman for ESPN said that Valvano was scheduled to provide live commentary on at least six games this season and would also serve as a studio host. (AP)
1992-10-21	When Ailing Pastime Meets TV Recession, Baseball Gets the K	Even as CBS's broadcasts of the World Series provide a compelling video window on the best that major league baseball has to offer, executives of the sport are preparing to negotiate new television contracts that are expected to end the prosperity previously wrought by TV. Next season will be the fourth and final year of the bonanza that will bring clubs $1.45 billion from CBS and ESPN -- double the amount produced by the previous six-year deal. But baseball says it has no way to prevent television from drastically reducing its financial commitment to the sport.
1992-10-01	Schoenfeld to Dissect N.H.L. on ESPN	ESPN, which signed a contract to broadcast National Hockey League games this season only to have SportsChannel America contest it in court, yesterday announced the hiring of JIM SCHOENFELD, the former coach of the New Jersey Devils, as a game analyst. He will be paired with GARY THORNE, a play-by-play announcer.
1992-09-29	N.H.L. Skating Its Way Through Maze of Cables	ESPN is busily preparing its return to hockey. The Oct. 6 premiere is a week away, but may not face off if SportsChannel America gets its legal way. Tomorrow, SCA will seek to undo the ESPN-N.H.L. deal by contending before the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court that the league violated last year's SCA-N.H.L. contract when it signed a Sept. 2 deal with ESPN.
1992-09-11	TV Ruling Favors N.H.L.	SportsChannel America was denied a preliminary injunction yesterday that would have required the National Hockey League to let SCA bid on the same deal that the league struck last week with ESPN. SCA had argued in State Supreme Court in Manhattan that a clause in its 1991-92 contract with the N.H.L. provided first-refusal rights obliging the league to submit a price it wanted SCA to pay for 1992-93.
1992-09-10	N.H.L. in Court on TV	The National Hockey League and SportsChannel America faced off acrimoniously in court yesterday as the N.H.L. defended its right to sell cable television rights for the next five years to ESPN despite SCA's claim that it was cut out of bidding. SCA filed suit in State Supreme Court Friday after the league and ESPN reached accord, charging that the league had not provided it with the right to match the ESPN offer, a provision that SCA said existed in its $5.5 million, 1991-92 contract with the N.H.L. Justice Shirley Fingerhood did not extend her temporary injunction barring the N.H.L. from pursuing any more television deals. The temporary injunction expired yesterday.
1992-09-04	Cable Network Drops Its Gloves and Sues the N.H.L.	SportsChannel America sued the National Hockey League yesterday in an attempt to overturn the league's new contract with ESPN. In a civil suit filed in New York State Supreme Court, SportsChannel America charged that it was treated unfairly when the N.H.L. moved back to ESPN after four years on SportsChannel America. The essence of the complaint is that SportsChannel says it had a right to match ESPN's bid, which could provide the league with up to $80 million over five years.
1992-09-03	N.H.L. and ESPN Together Again	"For the last four years, the National Hockey League has been a sports television version of ""Nothin' Exposure."" Pro hockey became almost invisible for the majority of viewers in the United States when it left the more widely available ESPN cable network and moved to SportsChannel America. But last night, the N.H.L. took a major step toward resurfacing as a major league when it announced a new agreement with ESPN for a game of the week package in the regular season and extensive coverage of the Stanley Cup playoffs for up to five years. In addition, ESPN and the N.H.L. will have the right to place some games on ABC, CBS or NBC."
1992-09-02	N.H.L. Set to Vote On Pact With ESPN	National Hockey League owners will vote by conference call today on a new television contract with the ESPN cable network, a league spokesman, Gary Meagher, said yesterday. The tentative package might not be as lucrative as the team owners expected last week when they met in Florida. A team executive close to the negotiations said yesterday that instead of selling five years for $80 million, the league might settle for one season at considerably less money.
1992-08-30	Cruises Add TV Sports	Passengers on Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Viking Line will be able to watch ESPN International Network sports events on big-screen television this fall. The programs, to be shown in the ships' public lounges, will include major league baseball and National Basketball Association games and will start Sept. 6 with broadcasts of National Football League contests. The network is a satellite sports system serving cable subscribers in 49 countries in Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
1992-08-27	Legal Sabers Rattle Over N.H.L. TV Plan	In a few days, the National Hockey League is expected to announce a five-year, $80 million TV deal with ESPN and ABC that will bring a game of the week and playoff contests to ESPN and a smattering of games to ABC. For Gil Stein, the league's acting president, it is a coup: At $16 million a year, he can present to his owners TV money nearly three times the $5.5 million SportsChannel America paid in 1991-92.
1992-08-26	N.H.L. Settles for a Jab in Confrontation With Goons	Faced with a chance to radically change their sport's rules about fighting, the lords of the National Hockey League put up their dukes for debate today and then backed off from the essence of the confrontation. Instead of voting for or against a proposal to eject all fighters, the Board of Governors tabled that motion and settled for a compromise solution that calls for only the instigators to be ejected. Currently, players deemed by referees to be instigators are given a two-minute minor penalty in addition to five minutes for fighting. Last season, the minor penalty for instigation was assessed in fewer than one-third of the fights.
1992-06-04	Optimism On Soccer TV	"ABC and ESPN, which will televise the 1994 World Cup, along with MasterCard International, Coca-Cola and M & M/Mars, which will sponsor the telecasts, are convinced of one thing: those who participate in soccer and those who attend games will watch the World Cup because it is the World Cup. At yesterday's announcement of the ABC-ESPN partnership with the three sponsors, each party sounded a similar note. ""We're convinced that when our country sees the event on their soil, it will be a tremendous success,"" said Steve Solomon, senior vice president of ABC Sports."
1992-05-28	TV Deal Near For World Cup	ABC and ESPN are expected on Wednesday to announce their deal to televise the World Cup in 1994, an $11 million contract that will place 11 games on ABC and 41 on ESPN. Eight of ESPN's games may be seen on a pay-per-view basis. A key part of the deal is the involvement of sponsors like Coca-Cola, MasterCard and M&M/Mars, who have made commitments for advertising time, and whose spots will air only during the pre-game, halftime and post-game periods.
1992-05-12	Great Shots, but What's Going On?	"There's something about watching ESPN's coverage of the America's Cup that inspires diverse reactions among those idle enough to tune in daily at 3 P.M. ""What a technical achievement,"" said one TV sports executive. ""I sat in my hotel room in Palm Springs for three hours a day watching it."""
1992-04-26	ESPN Crew's Mouths: A 4.0 in 40-Word Dash	Back back back back when L.B.J. (Southwest Texas State Teachers College), Nixon (Whittier College) and Ford (University of Michigan) were presidents, the National Football League draft was of moderate global import. Teams picked. The news media reported. Minicams, Mel Kiper Jr. and Madonna had not been invented. The draft is now covered by ESPN (today, 11 A.M.-4:30 P.M., Eastern time) with more ingenuity and effort than the television networks will plow into this summer's political conventions. Why not? The draft is better TV. More money is made. More tangible business is decided. No one argues about party platforms.
1992-04-24	Marinovich Is Cleared	A California judge dismissed drug charges against TODD MARINOVICH yesterday after concluding that the Los Angeles Raiders quarterback had successfully completed a six-month program for first-time offenders. Marinovich, who had been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in January 1991, was not in court in Newport Beach as Judge SUSANNE S. SHAW seemed to go out of her way to refute a recent report by ESPN that Marinovich had failed a confidential National Football League drug test three months ago.
1992-04-10	It's Easy to 'Pig Out' at This Buffet	"When ESPN needed a guerilla sloganeer to push its pro football package, it turned to the irrepressible adman, George Lois, the man behind ""I Want My Maypo."" He devised the elegant rallying cry: ""Pig Out."" Lois has now turned to pithily capturing ESPN's buffet platter of 156 baseball games and emerged with this tasteful effort: ""In Your Face."" The slogans are interchangeable, but ""Pig Out"" more accurately caught Monday's opening day tripleheader (truncated to two in New York because its broadcast of the Mets-Cards game was blacked out)."
1992-03-12	Valvano Set to Sign New Deal With ESPN	JIM VALVANO is expected to reject an offer today from Wichita State University to become its basketball coach and will sign a long-term extension of his ESPN contract, according to a source close to Valvano.
1991-12-24	Coaching Carousel Takes Networks Along for the Ride	Bill Parcells and Jim Valvano will perhaps, maybe, possibly leave after their first year of television and return to coaching, and observing them is a little like waiting for Mario Cuomo to make up his mind. You just want them, or their potential employers, to get on with it and stop boring us. Parcells, now with NBC, always gets an odd, devilish glint in his eyes when asked about being offered jobs in Tampa Bay and Green Bay. He always denies that he's leaving. He denied a CBS report that he met the Buccaneers' owner, Hugh Culverhouse, at a private New Jersey airport. Ron Wolf, the Packers' general manager, says Parcells is on his list of candidates but that so far, he has only asked the former Giants coach about his health and recent angioplasty procedure. Is former Director of Central IntelligenceWilliam Casey orchestrating this intrigue from the grave?
1991-11-22	Vincent Sounds an Alarm on TV Revenue	"Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent has told major league officials that if new television agreements were negotiated today, teams should expect at least 30 percent less than the $1.46 billion now being paid by CBS and ESPN in four-year contracts that expire at the end of 1993. ""It was part of his report to us about a variety of things,"" said Lou Gorman, general manager of the Boston Red Sox. ""Nobody probed it a lot, but everybody understood it'll be a tough go. It wasn't a rosy forecast."""
1991-09-15	In Cable's World of Boutiques, a Generalist Thrives	"When the television camera scanned the stands at the United States Open tennis championship match between Jimmy Connors and Paul Haarhuis recently, it caught, for a brief instant, the fans seated just behind the service line. Among the privileged: Connors' guests, and Kay Koplovitz, the president and chief executive of USA Network, with her guests Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the American Stock Exchange, and his wife, Marylin. One cable executive said the placement was vintage Koplovitz: ""She's always in the right place at the right time,"" he said."
1991-09-12	ESPN Is Said to Choose Lois/GGK for Account	Lois/GGK, New York, was awarded the advertising account of the ESPN sports-cable television network yesterday, according to advertising executives who insisted on anonymity.
1991-08-13	Two Product Symbols To Gain Exposure	"Two highly visible advertising symbols, a soft-drink slogan and a battery bunny, are getting wider exposure via unusual new promotions. The Pepsi-Cola Company is adding the word ""Uh-huh"" on packaging for Diet Pepsi, a spokesman, Andrew Giangola, said yesterday. The word caps the catchy jingle sung by Ray Charles that has been used since January in advertising created by BBDO Worldwide, New York: ""You've got the right one, baby, uh-huh!"""
1991-07-26	Here's Idea of the Day that Might Salvage Game of the Week	Memo to Fay Vincent, commissioner of baseball: Let's face it. The current baseball TV plan doesn't work. Too few games on CBS have demolished the old Game of the Week regularity and too many on ESPN make games as ordinary as disposable razors. CBS and ESPN are losing oodles of cash on baseball. After their deals expire in 1993, nobody will match the $1.46 billion they're paying together over four years.
1991-05-10	Put Down the Remote; Yachting's on ESPN	So it's action you want and tomorrow at 4 P.M. you're torn between NBC's Portland-Utah game and yachting on ESPN. You know what you'll get with the Blazers and the Jazz. Clyde Drexler will be swooping and hooping (whoa, stop me before I Walt Frazierize again) and Karl Malone will be delivering roundball mail. But even if yachting on TV has bored you to salty tears in the past, there still may be some reasons to consider tuning into the final race of the International America's Cup Class Championship, a prelude to next year's America's Cup.
1991-04-22	ESPN Show Was a Draftnik's Nirvana	ESPN's coverage of yesterday's National Football League draft proved one thing: that a record-length near-five-hour first round replete with talking heads need not be a sleepathon. Maybe the folks behind the Academy Awards show will learn from ESPN's run-and-shoot production that vapid song-and-dance numbers are unnecessary. Just put Chris Berman up on the podium to bestow the Oscar on Tom (Let Me Take You On A Sea) Cruise. In ESPN's most rapid-fire draft coverage yet, the cable network had Berman anchoring the main desk, Robin Roberts at a secondary desk nearby, and remotes in six locations, including Dallas Cowboys headquarters in Irving, Tex., and the Newport Beach, Calif., office of superagent Leigh Steinberg, who represents the top two picks, Russell Maryland and Eric Turner, and No. 16 pick Dan McGwire.
1991-04-14	Francesa Declines Offer	Late Friday, despite industry speculation that he would join ESPN, Mike Francesa turned down the cable network's offer to become its studio expert on college football and basketball and replace the late Pete Axthelm on its N.F.L. studio show. He is not expected to accept an ESPN counteroffer, said a source close to the talks. Francesa has offered commentary during CBS broadcasts of college football for two years and the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball tournament for three years. But because CBS will no longer broadcast college football, Francesa has sought additional broadcast outlets while retaining his role on CBS's N.C.A.A. tournament.
1990-11-29	A Return for Forte	Chet Forte, winner of 10 Emmy Awards before leaving ABC in 1987, will return to television as director of ESPN's telecast of the Breeders' Crown of harness racing in Pompano Beach, Fla., Friday night. Forte directed and produced sports programming for more than 25 years before falling on hard times.

Both Mr. Evey and John A. King, former president, now vice chairman of Stimpson Associates, were in town from Seattle a while ago and while the latter was elsewhere on another appointment, Mr. Evey, comfortably seated in the lobby cocktail lounge of the New York Hilton, talked a bit about the project. It has the financial backing of a number of Seattle businessmen/ boating enthusiasts, like Jack King, and has a target audience, Mr. Evey said, of 100 million fans of one or more of the myriad above- and below-water sports. There is also a $90 billion-in-sales suppliers' market, according to Mr. Evey.
1986-01-26	EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME - EXCEPT THE GAME	The problem of what to do for an encore is a frequent one in many pursuits; the problem of what to do for a centerpiece crops up rather less often. But that is precisely the situation faced today by ESPN which is presenting 15 1/2 hours of programming relating to the Super Bowl without being able to present the game itself. The rights to that were acquired long ago by NBC. Faced with having a menu without a main course, the sports channel has chosen to address this shortcoming with an avalanche of supportive programming that begins hours before dawn, breaks for Superbowl XX, and resumes after the game with a dramatized tribute to the late Vince Lombardi, who coached the Green Bay Packers to the first Super Bowl victory in 1967. For football insomniacs, ESPN's long Super Bowl run begins at 2:30 A.M., when ''SportsCenter,'' a live, 60-minute sports news program, will devote most of its time to last-minute developments involving the game. At 3:30 A.M., ''ESPN Special: Super Bowl XX'' reviews the past football season and analyzes its unfolding toward today's championship. Then, at 4 A.M., the service will present highlights, produced by National Football League films, of the first 16 Super Bowls in consecutive half-hour installments that continue until noon.

1985-10-27	TV PLANS FOR AMERICA'S CUP	The 1987 America's Cup Races are more than a year away. But programmers at ESPN, the cable network that recently bought the rights for live American television coverage, are convinced that viewers want to know what syndicates are doing now to prepare for the races. In responding to that interest, ESPN plans two 60-minute specials next month. The first, to be shown next Sunday, will detail current efforts by the San Diego yachtsman Dennis Conner to win back the 134-year-old trophy that he lost to Australia in 1983. The second show, scheduled for Nov. 25, will recap the launching last month of Australia III, one of the boats that will seek the role of defender.

TBS bid $60 million on behalf of WTBS, its super station servicing cable networks, and ESPN topped that with a bid of about $70 million for three years according to Arthur Sando, TBS vice president for corporate affairs.
