1/11/2006	Stones and Sweepers on Ice: Bankers Meet Olympic Curlers	''I never thought I'd be putting duct tape on shoes,'' Bret Scesa said. But there he was, standing on the ice yesterday in Wollman Rink in Central Park with duct tape covering the soles of his $500 Ferragamo loafers, for what amounted to Curling 101. Yes, curling, a Rodney Dangerfield of Olympic sports, one that gets no respect, one that has been mocked by David Letterman.
1/8/2006	No More Allowance	Last fall, Bank of America surveyed about 600 undergraduates at eight New York City-area colleges and found that: 16% spend more than $50 on a first date. 26% have jeans that cost more than $100. 27% would sell their iPods to raise cash. 63% would sell their textbooks. 59% expect to earn more money than their parents.
1/2/2006	Bank of America, Absorbing MBNA, Is No. 1 in Credit Cards	The Bank of America Corporation became the nation's No. 1 credit card issuer yesterday as it completed its $34.2 billion acquisition of the MBNA Corporation. The second-biggest bank in the United States by assets, Bank of America completed the purchase after receiving approval from shareholders and regulators.
11/20/2005	'The Bonfire Of the Vanities,' 2005 Edition	PAUL E. JOHNSON, a former Wall Street analyst who never saw an overpriced technology stock he didn't like, is still reeling from a federal jury's finding 10 days ago that he violated securities laws by misleading investors with his research. But his shock is less than shocking. After all, this is a man whose favorite state seems to be denial. He continued to rate more than 20 bubble stocks a ''buy'' in 2002 even after they had lost most of their value. And he was so certain that it was O.K. to advise investors in 2001 to buy the shares of a company as he was selling that he chose to try his case rather than settle with regulators. Bad move. While Mr. Johnson could be enjoying life after Wall Street  la those other fallen stock analysts, Jack Grubman or Henry Blodget, he instead faces unspecified civil penalties, disgorgement of illicit profits and disgrace. Unless, that is, the verdict is thrown out or Mr. Johnson wins his case on appeal.
11/3/2005	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: More Limits Put on Bank Stakes	Bank of America and other foreign institutions that have invested a combined $13 billion in China's banks will be required to hold their shares for at least three years and will not be allowed to buy stakes in more than two lenders, an official of the banking regulator said. The restrictions, in addition to a 25 percent foreign ownership cap, are aimed at safeguarding financial stability and preventing overseas dominance of the banking industry, Tang Shuangning, vice chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said in a speech in Beijing yesterday.
10/12/2005	Ex-Broker Is Said to Be Close to Deal With the S.E.C.	A former broker with the Bank of America Corporation who was acquitted in June on 29 of 33 criminal charges linked to improper mutual fund trading, is close to reaching a separate settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, people briefed on the discussions said. The broker, Theodore C. Sihpol III, had been accused of enabling a hedge fund manager, Edward J. Stern, to make improper fund trades. The acquittal on most of the counts was a rare legal defeat for the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who brought the case.
9/23/2005	For Bank of America, Next Target Is Europe	Bank of America has had an ambitious summer, acquiring MBNA for $35 billion and taking a stake in a Chinese bank. Less noticed has been its effort to ramp up its European business. The bank has made a string of hires, mainly in its London office, raising its presence in debt and capital markets and trading.
9/1/2005	Interpublic Loses Bank of America Account	THE troubled Interpublic Group of Companies was dealt a serious blow yesterday when one of its largest clients, the Bank of America Corporation, dismissed Interpublic and shifted its consolidated account, with total spending estimated at $600 million, to the Omnicom Group. The account shift is one of the largest in advertising in recent years. The Interpublic agencies that will be losing their assignments have worked for Bank of America -- the nation's No.2 bank behind Citibank -- since late 2002. The assignments accounted for $60 million to $65 million of the estimated $6.2 billion in revenue for Interpublic, the world's third-largest agency holding company behind Omnicom and the WPP Group.
8/9/2005	MEDIA: Addenda; An Interpublic Executive Takes His Dispute Public	A dispute between the Interpublic Group of Companies and Bruce Nelson, the senior executive who oversees one of its biggest accounts, has become public, not long after the account was placed in review. For several weeks, there had been speculation that Mr. Nelson, who since 2002 has overseen the work that 16 Interpublic agencies do for the Bank of America Corporation, was seeking to leave his post as executive vice president and chief marketing officer. But no one would discuss the matter publicly until Friday, a week after the bank announced the review. Mr. Nelson then told Adweek.com that he would resign over what he termed a disagreement in principle about how the account ought to be managed.
8/1/2005	New Trouble for Interpublic? Big Client, Bank of America, Calls Rival Agencies	THE troubled Interpublic Group of Companies, struggling on several fronts, suddenly finds itself fighting to hold onto one of its biggest clients, Bank of America. The Bank of America Corporation, which uses more than a dozen Interpublic agencies for tasks like advertising, direct marketing, media buying and interactive campaigns, has contacted Interpublic's biggest competitors, the Omnicom Group and the WPP Group, about the possibility of their agencies coming to work for the company. Interpublic is the third-largest agency company in revenue, behind Omnicom and WPP.
7/27/2005	General Motors to Sell Consumer Auto Loans to Bank of America	General Motors said Tuesday that it would sell up to $55 billion worth of consumer car loans to Bank of America over the next five years. The move follows downgrades in May of G.M.'s debt to a rating of below investment grade, or junk, by Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Those downgrades and rising interest rates have made it more expensive for G.M.'s financing division, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, to use bonds to raise money for car loans. But G.M.A.C., as the financing division is known, does have more palatable options available, like selling off large numbers of car loans in a relatively new kind of transaction known as a whole loan sale.
7/19/2005	2nd Quarter At Citigroup Disappoints Investors	The increased volatility in fixed-income markets in recent months took its toll on two of the nation's largest banks as Citigroup and Bank of America reported second-quarter earnings yesterday. Citigroup was harder hit, disappointing investors with second-quarter earnings that were below Wall Street's expectations.
7/12/2005	Is Wachovia Deal-Averse Or Is It Just Picky?	When will Wachovia join the big dance? Two years ago, Wachovia, the nation's fourth-largest bank, considered buying FleetBoston, but balked at the price. In waltzed its crosstown rival, Bank of America, which consummated the merger and strengthened its position in the Northeast. Three weeks ago, after walking away from the credit card giant MBNA, Wachovia again watched from the sidelines as Bank of America paid a 30 percent premium to become the nation's largest issuer of credit cards.
7/11/2005	Another China Bank Is Courted By the West	Goldman Sachs and Allianz of Germany are in talks to acquire a $1 billion stake in China's largest state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to a person briefed on the discussions. The talks come at a time when some of the world's biggest financial institutions are rushing into China to acquire stakes in some of the country's large but troubled state-owned banks ahead of planned initial public offerings in the next few years. The Bank of America said last month that it would pay $3 billion for a 9 percent stake in the nation's third-largest lender, the China Construction Bank, which is expected to offer shares to the public late this year.
7/10/2005	Hey, Sports Fans, Guess What We've Named Your Stadium	I ask you, would the fans in Mudville have named their stadium Fritos Field? Would there have been a Gipper if the Irish were asked to play in Sara Lee Stadium? Could the Babe have possibly smoked No. 60 into the bleachers of some ballpark named after an onion dip enhancer? Disappearing are the hallowed names of our sports stadiums -- Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, the Polo Grounds, Sportsman's Park -- names that stirred memories and images of champions. Yes, Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium have survived, but they may yet become Fig Newton Field and SnackWell's Stadium. As we speak, Churchill Downs could be dickering with SpaghettiOs.
7/8/2005	Case Isn't Closed as Spitzer's Office Plans to Retry Broker on 4 Counts	A former Bank of America broker who was acquitted last month on 29 of 33 criminal charges tied to improper trading of mutual funds, faces a retrial on the four counts on which jurors could not agree, lawyers in the case said yesterday. The broker, Theodore C. Sihpol III, 37, was charged by the office of Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, with making the improper trades on behalf of preferred clients. His acquittal was widely perceived as a setback for Mr. Spitzer, who has used his office to try to force broad changes in the way business is done on Wall Street.
7/2/2005	The Next Heavyweight Champion Of Banks; Differing Tactics By 2 Juggernauts Of Finance	This is a tale of two really, really big banks. Both are heavyweights in financial services with trillions of dollars in assets and billions in market capitalizations. Both offer a cornucopia of products and services to consumers and large corporate customers. Both have exhibited voracious appetites in recent years, gobbling up competitors to establish themselves as megabanks with coast-to-coast and even international reach.
7/1/2005	Against Expectations, Bank Resumes Its Buying Ways	Kenneth D. Lewis has quietly emerged as the deal maker to beat in the banking business. When he became chief executive of Bank of America four years ago, he promised to steer the company away from the frenetic takeover activity that had become its trademark.
7/1/2005	Scary Crash, Failed Deal, Then Plan B	When Bruce L. Hammonds, the chief executive of the MBNA Corporation, stepped into the company's Sikorsky S76C at the heliport at 34th Street in Manhattan with five senior executives on Friday afternoon two weeks ago, the mood was jovial. The executives had spent the day secretly negotiating to sell their company, one of the nation's largest credit card issuers, to Wachovia, the big bank. Both sides had agreed to the outlines of the deal; the only thing left to settle was the final price.
7/1/2005	Bank of America to Buy MBNA, A Prime Issuer of Credit Cards	Seeking to grab a bigger share of consumers' business by becoming a powerhouse in credit cards, the Bank of America Corporation announced plans yesterday to acquire the card giant MBNA for $35 billion in cash and stock. The deal represents a bet by Bank of America that consumer spending will remain robust. This could be a risky assumption if rising interest rates leave consumers feeling financially pressed, causing growth to slow sharply in businesses like home lending and credit cards, which have been particularly profitable for banks in recent years.
6/24/2005	For Some, 'Just Following Orders' Is a Good Defense	IN prosecuting white-collar crimes, it is sometimes easier to catch big fish than small fry. While the conviction of L. Dennis Kozlowski and the sentencing of John J. Rigas have been hailed as victories in the government's post-Enron campaign against corporate misconduct, the acquittal of Theodore C. Sihpol III shows that prosecuting low-level executives can be difficult.
6/17/2005	U.S. Bank Buys Stake In China	Looking to gain access to one of the hottest economies in the world, the Bank of America Corporation said Friday that it had agreed to acquire a 9 percent stake in China Construction Bank for $2.5 billion. For Bank of America, which has made acquisitions of several financial institutions in the United States, including last year's $47 billion takeover of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, the deal with China Construction is another indication of its plan to expand aggressively overseas.
6/12/2005	Maybe Spitzer's Cape Was Too Big	FOR the past several years, the knee-jerk response on Wall Street to even the most preliminary inquiry by Eliot Spitzer has been the same: ''O.K., I'll take a plea deal'' or ''Can we work out a settlement?'' The specter of Mr. Spitzer's wrath has made Masters of the Universe cower in a corner and sweat through their bespoke suits. That is why it's so remarkable that Theodore C. Sihpol III, a former broker at Bank of America, had the guts to stand up and defend himself when Mr. Spitzer, the New York attorney general, came calling with a list of criminal charges that accused him of making improper trades in mutual funds. If Mr. Sihpol had been convicted, he could have faced up to 30 years in prison.
6/10/2005	Ex-Broker Acquitted in Fund Case	A former broker with the Bank of America Corporation was acquitted yesterday of 29 counts tied to improper trading in mutual funds, the first major legal defeat for the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. A mistrial was declared on four remaining counts. The former broker, Theodore C. Sihpol III, 37, had been accused of enabling a hedge fund manager, Edward J. Stern, to make improper trades in mutual funds. It was a tip about trading by Mr. Stern's hedge fund in 2003 that initiated a sweeping investigation of the mutual fund industry by Mr. Spitzer's office, joined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.
5/5/2005	Singer's Grip On Songs Gets Shakier	Michael Jackson may have moved one step closer to losing his grip on his prized music-publishing catalogs. The pop star has long financed his lifestyle with an estimated $270 million in loans provided by Bank of America and secured by his catalogs, which include copyrights to songs by the Beatles, along with his own hits. But the bank has now sold the loans to a New York private equity fund, Fortress Investment Group, people close to Mr. Jackson said.
5/1/2005	Who Needs A Cable Car?	Sometimes, at the end of a day, life seems all uphill to Richard M. Rosenberg. But that's his choice: after all, he could always call a cab or hop a cable car. Still, the two-mile walk from his office in the Bank of America building in downtown San Francisco to his condominium on Russian Hill is a challenge that Mr. Rosenberg, 75, relishes.
4/19/2005	FleetBoston Acquisition Lifts Bank of America's Earnings	The Bank of America Corporation, the nation's third-largest bank, said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose 75 percent to a record as corporate lending and trading and the purchase of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation bolstered results. Net income increased to $4.7 billion, or $1.14 a share, from $2.68 billion, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier, when Bank of America did not yet own FleetBoston. The results gave the company 14 consecutive quarters of earnings increases.
4/19/2005	Spitzer's Office Prepares for Rare Trial	Over the last three years, the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, has taken on Wall Street, mutual fund managers and the insurance industry over abuses, winning billions of dollars in fines and restitution and forcing changes -- virtually all without going to trial. Now, the first major trial of an executive caught up in one of those investigations is soon to begin, providing a rare test for Mr. Spitzer's office.
3/17/2005	Purloined Lives	The phone lines are seldom quiet for long at the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center. But lately they have been ringing almost continually. The calls come from people like Warren Lambert, who phoned on Feb. 18, the same day he received a letter conveying alarming news from ChoicePoint, a company that compiles data on millions of citizens. It was only one of more than 140,000 such letters ChoicePoint has mailed in recent weeks, informing people like Mr. Lambert that computer files containing their names, addresses and Social Security numbers, among other critical personal data, had been inadvertently sold to ''several individuals, posing as legitimate business customers.''
3/10/2005	Poll Says Identity Theft Concerns Rose After High-Profile Breaches	Recent reports about data security breaches and privacy intrusions are starting to shake the confidence of many Americans. According to a monthly survey by the Ponemon Institute, a privacy consultancy based in Tucson, the number of people who believe they are safe from identity theft plunged last month, to 35 percent from 57 percent. While the number of those who believe they will become a victim was little changed (7 percent in late February versus 9 percent a month earlier), those who are unsure jumped to 58 percent from 34 percent.
3/7/2005	To attract more Internet customers, some banks are adding services available on their Web sites to their A.T.M.'s.	THOSE ubiquitous A.T.M.'s are about to get considerably smarter. Wells Fargo, the Bank of America and other financial institutions are giving their painfully low-tech A.T.M.'s a dose of Internet technology aimed at speeding transactions, reducing paperwork and exposing customers to a much wider range of transactions.
3/4/2005	Bank of America Settles Lawsuit Over WorldCom	Bank of America agreed yesterday to pay $460.5 million in a settlement with investors who bought WorldCom's stock and bonds before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. The deal was struck between Bank of America and Alan G. Hevesi, the comptroller of New York State and trustee of the state's Common Retirement Fund. Mr. Hevesi is the lead plaintiff in the securities class action representing investors who lost billions when WorldCom collapsed.
2/26/2005	In Boston, 'Derek Jeter' Is Rejected (Rated X)	Kerry Konrad's dream -- let's call it a mischievous wish -- was that on March 1, the FleetCenter in Boston would be renamed the DerekJeterCenter. ''My goal was to have the ultimate bragging rights with my buddies up there and tease my friends about the day I named it the DerekJeterCenter,'' said Konrad, 47, a Yankees fan who attended Harvard with certain members of Red Sox Nation.
2/26/2005	Bank Loses Tapes of Records Of 1.2 Million With Visa Cards	Bank of America said yesterday that it had lost computer backup tapes containing personal information about 1.2 million federal employees, including some senators, with Visa charge cards issued by the bank. A spokeswoman for Bank of America, Alexandra Trower, said the bank did not believe that the information had been stolen or had fallen into the hands of people using it to commit fraud. There has been no suspicious activity on any of the affected accounts, she said.
2/3/2005	A WorldCom Settlement Falls Apart	A landmark settlement last month that had 10 former WorldCom directors agreeing to pay $18 million from their own pockets to investors who lost money in the company's failure was scuttled yesterday. The settlement fell apart after the judge overseeing the case ruled that one aspect of the deal was illegal because it would have limited the directors' potential liability and exposed the investment banks that are also defendants in the case to greater damages. The lead plaintiff in the case said it could not proceed with the settlement with that provision removed.
1/28/2005	BANK OF AMERICA ENDING FEES ON TRANSFERS TO MEXICO	Bank of America is eliminating fees on money transfers to Mexico for its account holders in a sign of the increasing competition in the United States for the Hispanic market. The bank is dropping the foreign exchange fee of 3 percent on all transfers. It will also end the $10 transfer fee, beginning at Chicago branches and extending throughout the United States over the year. Mexicans working in the United States sent about $15.2 billion back home in the January to November period last year, up 25 percent from the year before, according to the Bank of Mexico. Other large United States banks have also cut transfer fees in recent years. Elisabeth Malkin (NYT)

1/9/2005	Deal-Making, In a Lower Gear	When Hugh L. McColl Jr. accompanied friends on a recent hunting trip to Spain in search of red-legged pheasants, an injured shoulder kept him from doing any shooting. ''I was the observation officer,'' he said wryly. Missing the main action isn't Mr. McColl's style. He is famous for pulling the trigger on dozens of mergers and acquisitions that turned NationsBank from a regional institution into the megacompany that is now the Bank of America. His major trophy was a merger with BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, in 1998; the merged company is based in NationsBank's home, Charlotte, N.C. Under his tenure, NationsBank's $12 billion in assets morphed into $610 billion as Bank of America.
1/9/2005	Mayday? Payday! Hit the Silk!	PITY Sammy Sosa. If the Chicago Cubs dump him after his contract expires this year, Mr. Sosa, the struggling slugger, will receive only a $4.5 million buyout payment and $3.5 million in severance. True, his send-off would be more lucrative than the one recently awarded to a group of baseball umpires: several got about $400,000 each to settle a severance dispute. And it is far better than the severance pay state officials want for 1,100 blue-collar workers at Great Northern Paper, a bankrupt company in Portland, Me. The state is suing the company's owner, seeking an average of about $23,000 for each of its former employees.
1/6/2005	10 EX-DIRECTORS FROM WORLDCOM TO PAY MILLIONS	Ten former directors of WorldCom, the telecommunications company whose bankruptcy was the largest in history, have agreed to pay $18 million of their own money to settle a class-action lawsuit by investors who lost hundreds of millions of dollars when the company collapsed in July 2002. The agreement by directors to dig into their own pockets, which is part of a $54 million settlement with plaintiffs led by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, is a remarkable concession. Directors have always relied on their company's insurance to cover costs associated with securities cases and settlements.
12/31/2004	Ruling Against Bank of America Is Upheld	Bank of America must pay $284 million to customers who were charged overdraft fees on accounts containing customer Social Security deposits, a California state judge ruled yesterday. Bank of America has said that it intends to appeal the decision, in which Judge Anne Bouliane, in San Francisco, confirmed her tentative Dec. 8 ruling.
12/21/2004	Bank of America Creates $100 Million Housing Fund	In his latest appearance aimed at drumming up support among black voters as he heads into an election year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg chose a Harlem cooperative project yesterday as the backdrop to announce a $100 million initiative to create 3,000 apartments citywide over the next five years. The money is being made available through a revolving loan fund set up by the Bank of America, which said it would finance construction of cooperative apartments, typically priced from $120,000 to $250,000. The apartments will be sold to applicants with moderate incomes, generally $40,000 to $60,000 for a family of four, according to city officials.
12/19/2004	The Theater Without a Stage	When Henry Miller -- actor, director, producer and colossal egotist -- built a Georgian-style, two-balcony theater on West 43rd Street in 1918, there was no such thing as a tilt monitor or a computer-assisted seismograph. Between then and now, the theater that bears his name was converted into a movie theater and, later, into a series of down-and-dirty discos, before being rescued by the Roundabout Theater Company for its 1998 revival of ''Cabaret.'' The Broadway production of ''Urinetown'' took up residence in 2001, but was evicted last winter after the Durst Organization, one of the city's biggest developers, announced it would build a $1 billion, 945-foot skyscraper for Bank of America on the site.
12/17/2004	Parmalat Sues 45 Banks to Recover $4 Billion	Parmalat, the bankrupt Italian dairy and food company, sued 45 banks on Thursday seeking to recover money it paid to them in the year before the company's collapse. Parmalat is seeking to recoup more than 3 billion euros ($3.97 billion) paid to the 45 creditors, according to a person close to the company. Thirty-five of the institutions being sued are Italian and 10 others are based in other European countries or the United States. The list does not include Bank of America and Citigroup, which have been sued by Parmalat in separate suits, said the person close to the company, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
12/16/2004	Judge in WorldCom Action Sides With Plaintiffs on Issue of Due Diligence by Banks	The federal judge in Manhattan who is overseeing the WorldCom securities class action ruled yesterday that the investment banks that sold billions of dollars of the company's bonds to investors the year before WorldCom collapsed must persuade a jury that they conducted appropriate due diligence and adequately disclosed the securities' risks to buyers. The ruling, by Judge Denise Cote, was a blow to J.P. Morgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America, three banks that had helped to sell $12 billion of the bonds in May 2001. The banks had sought to have the case thrown out, arguing that they were not required to do more due diligence on WorldCom because they had relied on the opinions of Arthur Andersen, the company's auditor, that its financial statements were accurate.
10/15/2004	Citigroup Has Record Gain; Bank of America Up 29%	Citigroup, the nation's largest bank, reported a record increase in earnings for the third quarter on Thursday and addressed concerns among investors about a corporate culture that has drawn regulatory scrutiny and a large legal settlement on three continents. The bank, buoyed by a robust consumer business that largely overshadowed the weak capital markets that continue to plague Wall Street firms, said its quarterly profit rose 13 percent, to $5.31 billion, or $1.02 a share, from $4.7 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
10/8/2004	Parmalat Files Another Suit, Naming Bank of America	Parmalat, the Italian food and dairy giant, filed another civil lawsuit against a major financial institution yesterday, contending that managers at the Bank of America helped structure a series of transactions that allowed more than $10 billion to be ''diverted, squandered or taken from the company'' before it collapsed last year. The suit, which was filed in Federal District Court in North Carolina, where Bank of America is based, is the fifth complaint against Parmalat's former lenders and auditors. It comes just a day after the company reached a 160 million euro ($197 million) settlement with Banca Intesa, Italy's largest bank, over separate charges of financial impropriety.
10/8/2004	A New Morality Makes Old Deceptions Expensive for Wall Street	LYING may be a sin, but on Wall Street there has always been a spirit of understanding for those who merely help others to deceive -- particularly because the fees for aiding in deception have often been far higher than those for simply arranging a straightforward financing. But that is changing, and this is a case of today's new morality being applied to yesterday's conduct.
10/2/2004	3 BANKS SETTLE ALABAMA WORLDCOM SUIT	Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase & Company and the Bank of America Corporation will pay $111 million to settle a suit by the Retirement Systems of Alabama over losses stemming from the collapse of WorldCom stock and bonds, a lawyer said yesterday. The suit by the organization, which represents public employee and teacher retirement plans, sought $275 million in damages, the systems' lawyer, J. Michael Rediker, said. The three banks were sued for underwriting WorldCom securities. Most suits filed by bondholders and shareholders have been combined into one case in federal court in New York led by the New York State Common Retirement Fund. The Alabama settlement allows the banks to avoid separate trials over similar issues, Mr. Rediker said.
9/28/2004	Technology Briefing | Deals: Cisco And Bank Of America To Announce Phone Venture	Cisco Systems has won a contract to deploy 180,000 Internet-based telephones into Bank of America branches over the next three years, the companies plan to announce today. The companies did not disclose the amount of the deal. The Cisco-made phones have a list price of $130 to $695 -- depending on features -- though they typically are sold at a considerable discount on big volume deals. Bank of America said it would deploy the phones in nearly 6,000 branches and office locations in order to consolidate its existing phone system, which includes several hundred different vendors and technologies. The Internet-based phones function like standard phones. However, because the voice stream information travels as data, the phones can offer companies added flexibility, according to Cisco. Matt Richtel (NYT)
9/27/2004	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Friday about Bank of America's conversion of Fleet branches in New York misstated Citigroup's ranking among operators of bank branches in the New York area. It is the third largest, not second; J.P. Morgan Chase is No.2. A chart with the article used an erroneous figure from the US Bancorp Web site for the number of that bank's branches. It is 2,344, not 2,100.
9/24/2004	Bank of America, A Believer in Branches, Opens in New York	Attention shoppers: Bank of America wants to be Wal-Mart, and it wants to be Wal-Mart now. In a departure from the dreary branch services that have been a hallmark of the banking industry, Bank of America's consumer business is run by executives who call its bank branches ''stores,'' refer to their banking clients as ''customers,'' and measure branch performance the way retailers do, by comparing sales at stores open at least a year.
9/9/2004	Bank to Sponsor Jazz at Lincoln Center	Bank of America, to promote the arrival of its retail banking division in New York City after the absorption of the Fleet Corporation, is donating $1 million to Jazz at Lincoln Center to become the ''presenting sponsor'' for the 2004-5 season. The sponsorship is the largest such deal for Jazz at Lincoln Center, which has also received financial support from marketers like the Altria Group and Coca-Cola. Derek E. Gordon, executive director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, said, ''It's the first time we will have a sponsor affiliated with everything we do all season, at our new home,'' the theater at Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan, scheduled to open Oct. 18.
8/25/2004	Environmentally Conscious Developers Try to Turn Green Into Platinum	Olympic athletes may dream of gold, but for developers of environmentally sound buildings there is an even higher level of achievement -- platinum, the best mark a building can receive under a four-tier system developed by the United States Green Building Council, a nonprofit industry group. So far, only a handful of platinum-certified buildings have been built, or even planned, so advocates of ''green'' building were thrilled when the Durst Organization and the Bank of America broke ground earlier this month on One Bryant Park, along Avenue of the Americas from 42nd Street to 43rd Street, a 52-story skyscraper that aims to be the first high-rise office building to achieve such a rating.
8/7/2004	BRITISH HOME BUILDER AGREES TO SELL DIVISION IN U.S.	Barratt Developments, a British home builder, has agreed to sell a division in the United States for $165 million to focus on Britain, where a housing shortage has helped push up prices. Three of Barratt's American managers, with backers including Bank of America, offered to buy the business, the chief executive, David A. Pretty, said. Proceeds will help cut debt and buy land in Britain. Michael D. Pattinson, president of the unit, Barratt American, for the last 13 years, instigated the deal by approaching Barratt with an offer after he helped return the business to profit, Mr. Pretty said. The American unit specializes in the sale of homes in Southern California at an average price of $300,000.
7/20/2004	E.D.S. WINS BIG CONTRACT TO MERGE BANK SYSTEMS	The Electronic Data Systems Corporation won a $1.1 billion contract yesterday from the Bank of America Corporation to merge the phone and computer systems of FleetBoston Financial into Bank of America's network. Bank of America bought FleetBoston in April for $48 billion. Electronic Data said the eight-and-a-half-year contract followed a 10-year, $4.5 billion agreement with Bank of America signed in December 2002. About 150 former Fleet employees will join Electronic Data, the world's second-biggest computer services company. Moody's Investors Service cut Electronic Data's credit rating to junk on Thursday, saying the company is taking too long to raise revenue and cash flow. The agreement is Electronic Data's first multibillion-dollar order since a December 2002 agreement with ABN Amro Holding N.V. Shares of Electronic Data, based in Plano, Tex., rose 62 cents, to $17.76. Shares of Bank of America, the nation's third-biggest bank, rose 91 cents, to $85.38.
7/15/2004	Consumer Lending Helps Bank of America in Quarter	The Bank of America Corporation said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose 41 percent, lifted by the purchase of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation and an increase in consumer lending. Net income climbed to $3.85 billion, or $1.86 a share, compared with $2.74 billion, or $1.80 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased 35 percent, to $13.2 billion.
7/8/2004	Trusting in the national pastime, Bank of America signs a five-year deal for several leagues of its own.	WITH a major new marketing deal it plans to detail today, Bank of America hopes to take consumers out to the ballgame, to minor-league games and even to their children's Little League games. The five-year deal gives Bank of America bragging rights as the ''Official Bank of Major League Baseball.'' But fans are more likely to notice the association in co-branded advertising, signs and newly sponsored player-of-the-week segments, which have been around in unsponsored form for more than 25 years. Bank of America will also sponsor an 18-wheel truck carrying baseball exhibits and interactive displays around the country this summer.
7/3/2004	Bank of America to Pay $69 Million to Settle Enron Suit	The Bank of America Corporation agreed yesterday to pay $69 million to settle a suit by Enron investors over the bank's role as underwriter for some debt offerings. Bank of America said in a statement that it broke no laws. It was the first financial institution to resolve class-action claims brought by investors who say they lost billions of dollars in Enron's collapse.
6/30/2004	BANK OF AMERICA BUYS CHRYSLER'S CREDIT-CARD ACCOUNTS	The Bank of America Corporation bought about 160,000 DaimlerChrysler credit-card accounts for an undisclosed price. The transaction makes Bank of America the issuer of Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Mercedes-Benz Visa credit-card portfolios in North America, the company said. DaimlerChrysler's North American financing unit, Chrysler Financial and Mercedes-Benz Credit, provides automobile financing for dealers and consumers, the company said in the statement. The unit is based in Farmington, Mich. A Chrysler Financial spokeswoman said Columbus Bank and Trust, a unit of the Synovus Financial Corporation of Columbus, Ga., was the previous card issuer. Bank of America is based in Charlotte, N.C.
6/6/2004	Lockboxes, Iraqi Loot And a Trail To the Fed	WHEN a United States Army sergeant broke through a false wall in a small building in Baghdad on a Friday afternoon a little over a year ago, he discovered more than three dozen sealed boxes containing about $160 million in neatly bundled $100 bills. Later that day, soldiers found more cash in other hideaways near the Tigris River, in an exclusive neighborhood that elite members of Saddam Hussein's government once called home. By the end of the evening, they had amassed 164 metal boxes, all riveted shut, that held about $650 million in shrink-wrapped greenbacks. The cash was so heavy, and so valuable, that the Army needed a C-130 Hercules cargo plane to airlift it to a secure location.
5/27/2004	Italian Prosecutors Ask Again For Trial in the Parmalat Case	Prosecutors in Milan made a second attempt on Wednesday to bring to trial 29 people and 3 institutions, including the Bank of America, that they say played a role in the collapse of Parmalat, the Italian diary giant. The people include Calisto Tanzi, who founded Parmalat 40 years ago, and three former chief financial officers. Also on the list are two of Mr. Tanzi's children and his brother, all of whom held managerial positions in the company or were on the board.
5/25/2004	BANK OF AMERICA PRESIDENT PLANS TO RESIGN	Bank of America said yesterday that its president, Eugene M. McQuade, would resign by the end of next month and get $25 million, including severance, after he leaves. Mr. McQuade, 55, was president and chief operating officer of the FleetBoston Financial before it was bought by Bank of America in April. He ''felt it was time to pursue different challenges and a new chapter in his career,'' the chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said in a statement. Mr. McQuade joined FleetBoston in 1992 and became chief financial officer in 1993. In 2002, he became president and chief operating officer. The chief executive of Fleet, Charles Gifford, is now chairman of Bank of America. The units Mr. McQuade oversees at Bank of America will be realigned. Tim Arnoult, head of technology and operations, will report to Mr. Lewis. Michael Mitchell, the workplace and security executive, will report to the chief financial officer, Marc Oken.
4/30/2004	Riggs Plans To Jettison Most Units Overseas	The Riggs National Corporation, mired in a wide-ranging federal investigation into possible money laundering and terrorist financing through accounts held at its Riggs Bank subsidiary, said yesterday that it planned to sell or exit most of its venerable embassy and international banking operations. Riggs, a Washington-based bank, plans to sell or exit its holdings in Britain, except for one branch in London; shut its operation in Miami; and close any embassy accounts that do not meet new guidelines that limit Riggs' exposure to countries with high levels of graft or rife with shady banking transactions.
4/22/2004	Ex-Broker Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud	Theodore C. Sihpol III, a former broker for the Bank of America Corporation, pleaded not guilty to fraud yesterday after being indicted this month in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan on 40 counts of fraud, grand larceny and falsifying statements. In the indictment, the office of Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, said Mr. Sihpol had allowed the Canary Capital Partners L.L.C. hedge fund to place trades after the deadline of 4 p.m. New York time and profit from market-moving news as much as 24 hours before the fund shares were valued again.
4/6/2004	Ex-Broker Is Indicted On Charges Of Fraud	A former broker for Bank of America, Theodore Sihpol III, the first person arrested in the New York attorney general's mutual fund investigation, was formally accused by a grand jury yesterday of defrauding investors in a trading scheme. Mr. Sihpol, 36, was indicted in the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan on 40 counts of fraud, grand larceny and falsifying statements. He is charged with allowing the Canary Capital Partners hedge fund to make trades after the 4 p.m. Eastern time deadline and profit from market-moving news as much as 24 hours before the shares were valued again, Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general, said in his indictment.
3/25/2004	Italian Judge Rejects Quick Prosecution in Parmalat Case	A judge on Wednesday rejected a request for accelerated indictments against 29 people, the Bank of America and two auditing firms, dealing a blow to prosecutors who were seeking a fast trial in the collapse of Parmalat, one of the world's biggest corporate fraud cases. Prosecutors had sought indictments for market manipulation against Bank of America, Deloitte & Touche and Grant Thornton's former Italian unit, now called Italaudit. Indictments for fraud, market manipulation and false accounting were sought for Calisto Tanzi, who founded Parmalat in 1961, and other company executives and auditors.
3/19/2004	Indictments Are Sought In the Collapse of Parmalat	Prosecutors here sought indictments of 29 people and 3 institutions on Thursday for their role in the multibillion-dollar collapse of the Italian dairy company Parmalat. More indictments are likely to be requested in the coming months, according to people close to the investigation.
3/17/2004	3 Banks Had Early Concern On WorldCom	Three big banks expressed misgivings internally about WorldCom's financial soundness in early 2001 just months before they helped the company sell $12 billion in debt, according to documents filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday. But their doubts -- and the basis for them -- were not disclosed to investors who bought the debt 14 months before WorldCom filed for bankruptcy. The role that banks may have played in papering over WorldCom's financial problems, which led to billions in investor losses, has not been determined. But the new documents indicate that institutions close to WorldCom knew more than they let on to investors and that they acted to protect themselves from the company's shaky finances even as they sold its securities to the investing public.
3/17/2004	For Bank Chief, Buying Big Rival Is Only the First Part of the Deal	Kenneth D. Lewis is making the biggest bet of his career. Fresh from settling regulators' complaints about mutual fund trading improprieties, Mr. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, will take the microphone today, a block away from the bank's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., to urge shareholders to vote for his bank's $48 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial.
3/16/2004	2 Big Banks In Merger Settle Case on Fund Trading	Just before a shareholder vote on their proposed merger, Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial reached a $675 million settlement with regulators yesterday over improper trading in their mutual funds, requiring Bank of America to replace most of its fund directors within a year. The settlement is the largest to date in the wide-ranging fund investigations and the first to focus on the role of boards in permitting improper trades.
2/27/2004	JURY AWARDS DAMAGES AGAINST BANK OF AMERICA	Bank of America was ordered by a California jury yesterday to pay at least $75 million for deducting fees from Social Security funds that had been electronically deposited into customer accounts. Damages could eventually total $1 billion, lawyers for the plaintiffs said. The jury in state court in San Francisco awarded $75 million in damages plus $1,000 for each customer who may have been harmed. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 1.1 million customers. A judge will have to determine how many customers are eligible for the payments.
2/25/2004	About New York; Fading To Memory, And Beyond	WHO will remember the Subway sandwich shop? Or that Pronto Pizza place? Or Tad's Steaks, with its ''Bathroom for Customers Only'' sign, and those rotisserie chickens spinning interminably on the spit? Who will remember these disposable businesses along this stretch of West 42nd Street, the one with no Times Square cachet? Not many, most likely. But for those who might be so inclined, heed the words now tumbling from a speaker outside another of those throwaway stores, the awkwardly named Westside Audio Video Inc.
2/25/2004	BANK OF AMERICA BUYS TRADING-SOFTWARE COMPANY	The Bank of America Corporation said yesterday that it had bought the Direct Access Financial Corporation, a private company that makes software for trading securities, to improve its new electronic trading services unit. Terms were not disclosed. Direct Access, which is based in Dallas, will become part of the bank's securities unit. Bank of America said its electronic trading services group would offer choices like program trading, in which a computer program is used to send buy or sell orders for single stocks, a list of securities or a block trade. Bank of America is based in Charlotte, N.C.
2/12/2004	Michael Jackson Faces Cash Crisis	Michael Jackson is near insolvency as he continues to pile up debt, sapping his last credit reserves, several close financial advisers say. Mr. Jackson faces an immediate cash crisis with a $70 million loan from the Bank of America that is due on Tuesday and has no money to repay it, the advisers said. But Al Malnik, a Miami entrepreneur who is helping repair Mr. Jackson's finances, said that he was trying to have the loan extended.
2/11/2004	7 Banks Said to Be Added To Parmalat Investigation	Prosecutors in Milan investigating the collapse of the food conglomerate Parmalat have placed seven banks, including three in the United States, under investigation for price manipulation, Italian news agencies reported Tuesday. The banks are Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Deutsche Bank, Banca Popolare di Lodi and the fund management arm of Banca Intesa, the news agencies ANSA and AGI reported, without citing the source of the information.
1/24/2004	New Searches and a Suicide In Parmalat Investigation	Italian police officials searched the Milan offices of Deutsche Bank on Friday, taking away documents, as the investigation into the collapse of Parmalat continues to examine the relationship between the company and its banks. The nearly monthlong investigation has now apparently taken a personal toll: a midlevel Parmalat executive who worked in the finance department committed suicide on Friday, Italian police said. And Calisto Tanzi, 65, the founder of Parmalat and one of the figures at the center of the investigation, was moved to a Milan hospital from prison, where he has been for almost a month. While he has lost about 15 pounds in prison, his health is not in serious danger, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
1/21/2004	Bank Finds No Signs of a Parmalat Account	Bank of America said on Tuesday that it could not find an account linked to Parmalat that an Italian lawyer had said held billions of euros. The lawyer, Carlo Zauli, over the weekend gave details of what he said was a Bank of America account at a New York branch holding 7 billion euros ($8.7 billion) belonging to Parmalat, the Italian food and dairy giant that collapsed last month. Bank of America had previously denied that such an account existed, but said it would do an internal investigation.
1/19/2004	Intrigue, and Perhaps a Lead, Over Missing Parmalat Billions	As investigators worked to find out what became of Parmalat's assets, a lawyer provided new details over the weekend about a Bank of America account in New York that he says holds billions of euros missing from the company. After Parmalat, the Italian dairy giant, sought protection from creditors last month, investigators here, as well as in Milan and Bologna, have been trying to track billions of euros that are said to have disappeared from Parmalat's books over the last decade through a network of fraudulent offshore accounts.
1/16/2004	When Banks Go National	This week's announcement that J. P. Morgan Chase will acquire Bank One, much like Bank of America's proposed merger with FleetBoston Financial, signifies the advent of nationwide commercial banks. It is a healthy, long overdue development. For two centuries, in an idiosyncratic nod to Andrew Jackson's 19th-century populism and 18th-century quarrels between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, banks were hindered from operating in more than one state. Under this senseless arrangement, businesses could not rely on one bank in various markets. Individuals were forced to find a new bank if they were moving across a state line, as if they had moved abroad.
1/15/2004	Deal Expands Gap Between Leaders and Pack	The merger of Bank One and J.P. Morgan Chase will substantially widen the gap between the nation's three largest banks and the rest of the industry, making it virtually impossible for the smaller banks to catch up, analysts and investment bankers said. The combined bank will be close to Citigroup in assets, and just slightly larger than Bank of America, which announced its own merger with FleetBoston Financial just three months ago.
1/10/2004	Parmalat Evidence Sought At Branch of U.S. Bank	Italian financial police searched the Milan offices of Bank of America on Friday as they sought evidence about the role that banks and auditors might have played in the collapse of Parmalat. And a top Parmalat executive, Giovanni Bonici, returned to Italy from Venezuela to face questioning from prosecutors. A Milan prosecutor and investigators spent nearly eight hours at Bank of America's offices and left with dozens of cartons, a day after one of the bank's former employees was questioned.
1/9/2004	Trades Backed By Big Banks Draw Interest Of Regulators	The New York State attorney general and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether some large banks financed improper mutual fund trades by hedge funds. The financings being investigated, which involved total return swaps, are reminiscent of the sort of transactions done by bankers on behalf of the Enron Corporation to conceal debt and artificially inflate earnings, regulators said. In both situations, the banks appear to have been ''knowingly aiding and abetting a securities violation,'' said Stephen M. Cutler, director of enforcement at the S.E.C.
1/6/2004	S.E.C. Said to Open New Inquiry Into Unit of Bank of America	The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether one or more employees of the investment banking division of Bank of America traded stocks in advance of ratings changes by research analysts, a person briefed on the matter said yesterday. The S.E.C. is considering taking action against the bank unit for improperly storing documents sought by the regulators in connection with the investigation, this person said.
1/3/2004	Inquiry At Big Bank's Securities Division	The Bank of America Corporation, the nation's third-biggest bank, said that its securities arm may face civil action by the Securities and Exchange Commission because of alleged record-keeping violations during an investigation into ''certain trading activities.'' The S.E.C. contends the unit was ''improperly storing certain documents relevant to an inquiry and not producing the requested documents in a timely manner,'' the bank said in statement. Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said it was still providing the S.E.C. with documents regarding an inquiry that began in November 2001.
12/22/2003	Parmalat Is Said to Be Ready To Declare Insolvency in Days	Parmalat, the giant Italian dairy foods group, is expected to declare insolvency and seek legal protection from creditors before Christmas, a person close to the company said Sunday. Parmalat's chairman and chief executive, Enrico Bondi, was meeting Sunday with bankers and legal advisers and was expected to meet Monday with labor union representatives to discuss the options open to the company, the person said.
12/19/2003	Durst Gets Land to Build Tower Near Times Square	Completing an effort begun 36 years ago by his father, the developer Douglas Durst yesterday bought the last of 32 parcels on an entire city block near Times Square, where he intends to build a 50-story skyscraper. The final two parcels, on a block steeped in New York history, scandal and real-estate wars, came with one of the highest-ever price tags in New York: about $384 for each square foot of land. However expensive, the deal clears the way for Mr. Durst to build a $1 billion, 2.1-million-square-foot office tower that would serve as the New York headquarters for the Bank of America, on most of the block bounded by 42nd and 43rd Streets, between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas.
11/30/2003	Downtown Freddie Brown Is Still a Man to Bank On	Fred Brown had a successful and fulfilling career as a guard with the Seattle SuperSonics, serving as captain of the 1979 N.B.A. championship team, playing in one All-Star Game and scoring more points than anyone in franchise history besides Gary Payton. So Brown never felt compelled to return to the court or pictured himself playing in today's game. Until zone defenses became legal.
11/21/2003	Hearing Splits on Public Help For a Proposed Office Tower	The prospect of another skyscraper sets off a hue and cry in many Manhattan neighborhoods, but rarely in the glass-and-steel canyons along the Avenue of the Americas or 42nd Street. But a local landlord, a local civic group and some politicians railed at a public hearing yesterday about a proposed 51-story, $1 billion skyscraper that would serve as a headquarters for Bank of America on the block between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas, from 42nd to 43rd Streets. Critics opposed not so much the tower but public subsidies for the 2.1-million-square-foot project and the state's use of condemnation to gain control of the land.
11/11/2003	Corrections	Because of an editing error, a news analysis article in Business Day on Friday about recent acquisitions referred incorrectly to a banking analyst at Smith Barney, who commented on Bank of America's agreement to buy FleetBoston Financial. The analyst, Ruchi Madan, is a woman.
11/7/2003	Stars Were Aligned for Mergers, Then Investors Spoke	The latest merger boom may turn out to be just a boomlet. A week ago, speculation was rampant on Wall Street that a new wave of mergers and acquisitions would follow the announcements of Bank of America's $48 billion agreement to buy FleetBoston Financial and Anthem's $16 billion acquisition of WellPoint Health Networks, the biggest deals of the year so far.
10/29/2003	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Merger accord provisions mean Bank of America is unlikely to face a challenge to its FleetBoston bid.	BANK OF AMERICA is unlikely to confront challengers to its $48 billion bid for FleetBoston Financial, bankers and analysts said yesterday, even though other banks had expressed interest in buying FleetBoston. The decline in Bank of America's stock has also the reduced the value of its offer. The two banks inserted provisions into their merger agreement that would make it expensive for another bank to make a hostile offer for FleetBoston. Also, analysts and advisers said, hostile takeovers of banks are rarely successful.
10/28/2003	Salesmanship Crucial for Executive as Critics Speak Out	Kenneth D. Lewis, the chairman and chief executive of Bank of America, has spent most of his working life selling things. Even so, after orchestrating his company's $48 billion purchase of FleetBoston Financial, he may be looking at the biggest sales job of his career -- persuading Wall Street and investors that the deal makes economic and strategic sense. As a 12-year-old in Columbus, Ga., Mr. Lewis delivered newspapers. In high school he was a star salesman at Butler's shoe store in Columbus. And he logged some time as a fire insurance underwriter and an airline reservations agent when he was in college at Georgia State University in the late 1960's.
10/28/2003	BANK OF AMERICA AND FLEETBOSTON AGREE TO MERGER	Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial announced yesterday that they would combine to create a consumer banking giant with branches from Maine to California. Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., but has a strong California franchise, will pay an estimated $48 billion in stock for FleetBoston's robust presence in the Northeast and for access to some of the wealthiest households in the country. Combined, the institution would be the nation's second-largest bank in assets and would control nearly 10 percent of the nation's deposits, the maximum that can be gained by acquisition. All told, it would have 5,700 branches in 29 states.
10/28/2003	Fear of Losing Name With Roots in Colonial Boston	Through mergers and acquisitions over the years, FleetBoston Financial has become the foremost banking institution in New England. But with Bank of America's announcement on Monday that it will acquire Fleet in a $48 billion deal, the Fleet name may soon disappear from the cityscape it now dominates. The merger with Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., was greeted here with mixed reactions. Public officials cautioned that the deal could hurt the Boston economy. But some financial analysts said that it could lead to improved banking services in New England.
10/28/2003	Fleet Customers Looking for Easier Transition	FleetBoston customers know about acquisitions. The company has bought more than 50 other banks over the last two decades, growing its assets to $196 billion from $39.5 billion in 1993. Consumers' complaints in the wake of some of those acquisitions mirror those that have accompanied other bank mergers, which have proliferated in the last few years. In addition to higher fees, a phenomenon confirmed by the Federal Reserve and others, customers have cited customer service problems, inferior rates and the inconvenience of new account numbers. They also object to receiving sales pitches from the other branches of the acquiring bank.
10/28/2003	Buy Leaves Bank Short of Wall St. Dreams	Buying FleetBoston Financial might fill out Bank of America's national branch network, but it would not fulfill the acquirer's Wall Street dreams. Although the deal would make Bank of America almost three times as big as Citigroup in American consumer banking, it would still trail Citigroup in businesses like investment banking and money management. To move quickly into the top ranks in those highly competitive but potentially lucrative financial services, Bank of America may have to make more acquisitions.
10/22/2003	Wide Range of Tax Shelters Draws Senate Inquiry	Major companies have leased parts of the subway systems in Washington, Boston and Chicago, to be joined soon by water mains in New York City, in deals intended to cut the companies' tax bills and to get around rules prohibiting abusive tax shelters, said a witness at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Tuesday. Big American corporations are also receiving tax breaks for leasing public assets in Canada and much of Europe in similarly circumspect deals, said the witness, a leasing industry executive who testified behind a screen to conceal his identity.
10/15/2003	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Despite a mutual fund scandal, Bank of America reports a sharply higher profit for the quarter.	BANK OF AMERICA, under a cloud for its role in a widening mutual fund trading scandal, reported a strong profit yesterday, helped by continuing demand for home loans. It also set aside $100 million to cover costs related to the investigation of the bank's fund business by the New York attorney general and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consumers have not pulled much money from the bank's mutual funds since the regulatory inquiry became public last month, although its chief financial officer, James H. Hance Jr., conceded yesterday that it might be too early to declare victory on this front.
10/8/2003	Bank Widens Offer to Repay Fund Holders Amid Inquiry	Bank of America took steps yesterday in yet another attempt to put regulators' scrutiny of its mutual fund business behind it. The bank, which had already pledged to reimburse shareholders of its mutual funds who lost money because of improper trading, now is offering to pay back holders of any fund affected by trades that it allowed. It also appointed several outside advisers, including a former comptroller of the currency and a retired executive of General Electric, to review its fund operations.
10/4/2003	Merrill Fires Three Brokers Over Trading	Merrill Lynch fired three senior brokers yesterday for conducting inappropriate mutual fund trades with a hedge fund that is at the center of a state and federal investigation into trading abuses, according to an executive briefed on the matter. In addition, Fred Alger Management, an investment company with $10 billion in assets, suspended three employees because of their possible involvement in some type of improper trading.
9/30/2003	Bonds for a Midtown Skyscraper Bring Out Supporters and Critics	The announcements for public hearings by the city's Industrial Development Agency are usually buried in the back of a newspaper and rarely draw more than a handful of people to consider what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies for private projects. But there was a full house on hand yesterday, about 75 people, for a debate over the merits of a $915 million, 57-story skyscraper for Bank of America at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas. Critics and supporters focused on the city's plan to provide $650 million in tax-free financing known as Liberty Bonds for the bank, which would be the principal tenant, and its development partner, the Durst Organization.
9/28/2003	How Bank of America Stumbled	KENNETH D. LEWIS, the chairman and chief executive of Bank of America, is learning just how treacherous taking on Wall Street's big boys can be. Three years ago, he decided to join the hypercompetitive battle for the assets of affluent investors. He set the ambitious goal of more than doubling the amount of the bank's profits from managing investments, a lucrative business dominated by mutual fund giants like Fidelity and brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch.
9/24/2003	First Wave Of Suits Hits Mutual Funds Under Inquiry	The lawyers who have filed hundreds of claims against investment banks, research analysts and corporate executives are now training their guns on mutual funds. Nearly a dozen plaintiff law firms have brought lawsuits against companies that manage mutual funds in the three weeks since Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, accused some fund companies of allowing favored investors to engage in trades not possible for most shareholders. Bank One, Strong Capital Management, Bank of America and Janus have been named in the suits, as they were by Mr. Spitzer.
9/17/2003	Ex-Broker Charged in Criminal Fraud Case	A former broker at Bank of America was charged with larceny and securities fraud yesterday, accused of helping a hedge fund engage in after-hours trading of mutual fund shares. The broker, Theodore C. Sihpol III, is the first to face criminal charges by the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, since Mr. Spitzer began his far-ranging investigation of Wall Street practices. Given the greater burden of proof for criminal cases, Mr. Spitzer is displaying confidence in his case, securities lawyers said. Previous actions against Wall Street firms were civil suits that ended in settlements.
9/16/2003	Ex-Managers at Bank May Face Charges	Bank of America has been notified that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general are considering bringing cases against former employees of the bank later this week, people close to the discussions said yesterday. The attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, could bring criminal charges, these people said. They would be the first criminal charges brought by Mr. Spitzer's office in his investigation of Wall Street.
9/14/2003	Corrections	The Market Watch column last Sunday, about possible conflicts of interest in the mutual fund industry, misidentified the chairman of the Nations Funds of Bank of America, who was described as unavailable for comment. The present chairman is William P. Carmichael; the previous chairman, A. Max Walker, died on Aug. 9.
9/14/2003	Some Wall Street Jobs Are Now on Main Street	Two years after the terror attack forced Wall Street firms to disperse thousands of employees to suburbs, most of the firms have come back, either to their old homes or to new ones. But many of their workers remain in offices from Connecticut to central New Jersey. Having been driven from their headquarters for weeks while they scrambled to restore trading ability, some of the biggest financial companies decided to spread out their operations to reduce their reliance on Manhattan's infrastructure. In several cases, the move to strengthen backup sites has cost New York significant numbers of jobs.
9/12/2003	Bank of America Executive Is Said to Have Departed	The head of Bank of America's mutual fund business, Robert H. Gordon, whose actions were highlighted in an investigation into improper trading of fund shares, left the company this week, executives who know him said last night. Mr. Gordon, who had been the chief executive of Banc of America Capital Management, as the bank's mutual fund division is known, figured prominently in a complaint filed last week by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, against Canary Capital.
9/9/2003	Bank to Pay Back Hedge Fund Investors	Bank of America, accused by the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, of letting a hedge fund engage in improper mutual fund trading, said yesterday that it planned to reimburse investors who lost money from the transactions. The bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., said in a statement that an independent review would determine how much the trading by Canary Capital Partners L.L.C. cost its Nations Funds shareholders. The bank also said it would return to the funds all fees generated by the trading.
9/7/2003	A Son of the Ultrawealthy, Caught Up in the Pursuit of Profit	Just about a decade ago, Spy magazine ran an article poking fun at billionaires so cheap that they would cash a check for 13 cents. (Yes, Donald Trump was one.) But most readers did not know the piece's real punch line: the pseudonymous author was himself a scion of one of New York City's very richest families. In real life, he was Edward Julius Stern -- Eddie to nearly everyone. He is a son of Leonard N. Stern, who almost cornered the market in pet supplies before becoming warehouse king of New Jersey and then, as moguls will, devoting himself to philanthropy.
9/7/2003	Reform Knocks. Will Funds Answer?	AMERICA'S mutual funds constitute one of the greatest stores of wealth in the world, holding almost $7 trillion of other people's money. The question Eliot Spitzer has raised is: Who is minding it? By asserting last week that large fund companies put the interests of one wealthy family ahead of those of thousands of shareholders, Mr. Spitzer, the New York attorney general, has rerouted the corporate reform bandwagon and parked it at the fund industry's doorstep. As with their counterparts in the brokerage business, fund companies will now have to address their built-in conflicts of interest and outdated management structures.
9/6/2003	Corrections	A capsule summary in The Metro Section yesterday referring to an article in Business Day about scrutiny of a bank's mutual fund business by the New York State attorney general misidentified the bank. It is the Bank of America, not the Bank of New York.
9/5/2003	Plans to Use Tax-Free Bonds for Midtown Tower Cause a Stir	Plans to build a 50-story headquarters for Bank of America on 42nd Street have stirred opposition from some real estate executives and civic groups because of the bank's request for $650 million in tax-exempt bonds allocated for post-Sept. 11 rebuilding. The critics do not object to the construction of the 2.1-million-square-foot tower near the Avenue of the Americas. But they said they do oppose the state and city using special subsidies designed to encourage the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan for projects in Midtown, particularly because some of the new office space will compete for tenants with acres of vacant office space downtown.
9/5/2003	S.E.C. Putting Mutual Funds Under Scrutiny On Late Trading	Top officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that they had sent a letter to big mutual fund companies asking for additional information about trading in their shares. The enforcement division wants all documents regarding the companies' policies on who can trade in their shares late in the day and who can jump in and out of their funds quickly.
9/5/2003	Bank Seeks Safety and Stability but Then Finds Trouble	The management of Bank of America has focused on reducing risk and staying out of the headlines for the last two years. But one of the bank's smaller, supposedly staid businesses is drawing unwanted attention. The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, says the bank's mutual fund business engaged in improper trading activity with a hedge fund, and he is contemplating possible civil and criminal charges against the bank and other fund managers.
9/5/2003	How to Beat the Market: Easy. Make Late Trades.	Will Rogers used to tell his listeners how to invest in the stock market. Buy stocks that go up and then sell them, he said. If they don't go up, don't buy them. That advice got laughs, but the folks at Bank of America found a way to help a favored customer do just that when it came to buying mutual funds. They let him wait until hours after the market closed and then buy or sell at the 4 p.m. price. The trade could come after news broke that was virtually certain to move the market in one direction or another the next day.
9/4/2003	Big Fine Over Trader's Mutual-Fund Moves	Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, said yesterday that his office had uncovered widespread illegal trading by hedge funds and mutual fund companies. While announcing a settlement with one hedge fund, Mr. Spitzer said it was just the first step in a broad-based investigation of how mutual fund companies conduct their trading operations. Upstaging federal securities regulators once again, he is accusing fund companies of favoring the short-term interests of institutional clients over individuals who invest for the long term.
9/3/2003	BANK OF AMERICA UNITS WIN REDUCTION OF JURY AWARD	Two Bank of America Corporation units won a $43 million reduction of a Texas jury verdict, as a state judge ordered them to pay $8.2 million to a debt collection company for breaching an agreement to sell a debt portfolio. A jury in Dallas had ordered the EquiCredit Corporation of America and the SunStar Acceptance Corporation to pay Cavalry Investments $51.3 million, including $25 million in punitive damages. Judge Bruce Woody reduced the award to $8.2 million on Friday. He overturned all the punitive damages and the verdict on contract interference. Judge Woody upheld the finding of breach of contract. Cavalry said it would appeal the reduction.
7/15/2003	Market Place; Citigroup and Bank of America report healthy profits. Could this be the start of something big?	CITIGROUP and Bank of America may prove to be tough earnings acts to follow. On the strength of strong consumer businesses, the two large banks posted healthy profits in the second quarter, buoying the market over all and bank stocks in particular. Not only did Citigroup exceed the expectation of Wall Street analysts with earnings that rose 5 percent on record revenue, but it said it would increase its dividend 75 percent.
7/10/2003	Latest German Fad: Leasing Out the Subway	With smooth-running trains, bright, well-kept stations and a blissful lack of crowds, Frankfurt's subway is a pleasant surprise for people from more teeming cities. For American visitors who cannot get enough of the U-Bahn subway system, Frankfurt is making a special, once-in-a-lifetime offer: lease the whole system for 99 years with an upfront payment of roughly $100 million. Frankfurt will even throw in its above-ground streetcar network.
7/2/2003	BANK OF AMERICA SELLS PROPERTY TO REALTY TRUST	American Financial Realty Trust, a real estate investment company that sold shares last week in an initial public offering, said yesterday that it had bought 158 properties from the Bank of America Corporation for about $770 million. The 8.1 million square feet will be leased back to Bank of America, American Financial said. The assets include the Bank of America Center in Chicago's financial district and other office buildings in 19 states. American Financial raised $699.4 million in its first stock sale. The offering was managed by Banc of America Securities and the Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group.
6/28/2003	Inquiry Into Currency Trading Ends	FXall, an electronic currency trading system set up by some large banks, said yesterday that the Justice Department dropped a three-year investigation into how the firm handled trading in the $1.2-trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. ''There was no action taken,'' Philip Weisberg, chief executive of FXall, said. ''The FXall business model remains identical to what we established in our original business plan.''
6/9/2003	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about plans by New York State to condemn land for a Bank of America headquarters in Times Square referred imprecisely to boundaries. The parcels take up two-thirds of the block bounded by Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas, between 42nd and 43rd Streets, not the entire block. The state has already condemned and acquired the other third of the block, which it leases to the owner of the Cond Nast building.
6/4/2003	2 Property Owners Object to Plan For Skyscraper Near Times Sq.	Just as plans for a new skyscraper were forming near Times Square, the owners of two parcels of land on the block have said they oppose efforts by a developer and the state to condemn their property to make way for it. The Empire State Development Corporation announced on Monday that it would hold a public hearing about the project, a 57-story headquarters for Bank of America, on June 18, the first step in the process of condemning the land for a new skyscraper. If the state is successful, it will condemn all the land on the block bound by Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas, between 42nd and 43rd Streets, and lease the property to the developer Douglas Durst, who will, in turn, build a $1 billion tower for Bank of America.
5/27/2003	Bank of America Nears Agreement With Developer to Build 42nd Street Skyscraper	Bank of America is close to signing a deal with the developer Douglas Durst to build a skyscraper on 42nd Street, near the Avenue of the Americas, which would become the bank's New York headquarters. The bank would be a partner in the project and occupy half the space in the proposed $1 billion tower, which is expected to contain 2 million square feet of space, according to real estate executives and government officials. It would stand next to the Cond Nast Tower, the 48-story skyscraper Mr. Durst built in Times Square four years ago.
4/17/2003	New Charges Against Ex-WorldCom Executive	Scott D. Sullivan, the former chief financial officer of WorldCom whose accounting maneuvers plunged the company into scandal, was indicted yesterday on additional federal charges that accuse him of defrauding a series of banks out of billions of dollars. The new charges, filed as part of what is known as a superseding indictment, increase the potential prison time that Mr. Sullivan could face. But they add little new information to the allegations of a huge fraud at WorldCom that the government contends was perpetuated to hide its deteriorating financial condition.
3/23/2003	Credit Card Woes	To the Editor: I hadn't traveled beyond my home in the Bay area and my Visa card was denied the second time; I called the customer service number on my way home. ''Have you been to Europe recently?'' was the query. ''No'' my reply.
3/12/2003	Bank of America Is Scouting Midtown as Site for New Headquarters	Bank of America is working on tentative plans for a new headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, possibly on 42nd Street, New York's boulevard of dreams. The prospect is causing enthusiasm bordering on giddiness among developers and state and city officials. The bank, which has thousands of employees at several Manhattan locations, has been meeting in recent weeks with developers like Douglas Durst of the Durst Organization and Richard Clark of Brookfield Financial Properties, as well as public officials, to discuss its search for a new one-million-square-foot home.
3/11/2003	HSBC TO BUY BRAZILIAN UNIT OF BANK OF AMERICA	HSBC Holdings, the British bank, will take over Bank of America's asset management business in Brazil, becoming the largest international manager of funds in the country, the bank's unit in S?o Paulo said. The sale follows the exit of J.P. Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank from the asset management business in Brazil. Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., is scaling back in Brazil and Argentina as slowing growth and weakening currencies threaten profit. Unlike Bank of America, HSBC has a branch network in the country, has been among the largest asset managers and is big enough to make the transaction profitable, analysts said.
2/19/2003	Bank of America shifts campaign to 'higher standards.'	IN the first campaign since consolidating its marketing efforts at the troubled Interpublic Group of Companies, Bank of America this week introduces a slogan more appropriate to the post-Enron, post-Andersen corporate world. The $100 million campaign jettisons the 18-month-old theme of ''Embracing ingenuity'' for one proclaiming the company's intent to seek ''Higher standards'' in providing products and services for its customers in 21 states.
2/14/2003	Deutsch Loses Pfizer But Gains Big Bank	Deutsch in New York is losing a major client at the same time that it is gaining another. Pfizer is parting ways with Deutsch after the failure of a yearlong effort to renegotiate the compensation agreement. Deutsch has worked for Pfizer since 1999, handling direct-to-consumer advertising for drugs like Bextra, Zoloft and Zyrtec, with total billings estimated at $120 million.
1/24/2003	Bank of America Unit Accused of Sex Bias	The Bank of America Corporation's investment banking unit has been sued in a sex bias suit by an analyst who says she was demeaned, harassed and denied job opportunities because of her sex. The analyst, Racquel Whilby, charged that co-workers and supervisors at Banc of America Securities L.L.C., a unit of the bank, engaged in ''rampant discrimination'' against women.
1/16/2003	Bank of America Reports Higher Profit	The Bank of America Corporation said today that its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings increased 27 percent on higher fees from mortgages and credit card loans and from cuts in expenses. Net income rose to $2.61 billion, or $1.69 a share, compared with $2.06 billion, or $1.28, a year earlier. Revenue was little changed at $8.8 billion as fees from investment banking, trading and money management fell. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.63 a share, according to Thomson First Call.
12/12/2002	Bank Calls Purchase Way to Woo Hispanics	Bank of America said today that it would pay $1.6 billion in cash for 24.9 percent of Grupo Financiero Santander Serfn, the most profitable bank in Mexico. Bank of America says it will compete with Citigroup for Mexican and Mexican-American customers in the United States. It particularly hopes to win a larger share of fees from the $10 billion in remittances they send to Mexico each year. Those fees are an estimated $1 billion annually.
12/4/2002	BANK OF AMERICA PLANS TO EXPAND IN MAJOR CITIES	The Bank of America Corporation plans to open 15 branches in Chicago next year, followed by branches in New York City, Boston and Philadelphia, as the bank tries to sell more loans and credit cards to wealthy customers, its chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, said. The company, based in Charlotte, N.C., plans branches in the largest Midwestern and Northeastern cities because private-banking and commercial customers there ''are saying they will do more business with us,'' Mr. Lewis told investors and analysts at a Goldman, Sachs bank conference in New York.
11/20/2002	IN COST-CUTTING MOVE, BANK OF AMERICA TO TRIM WORKERS	The Bank of America Corporation, plans to lay off 900 technology and operations workers by the end of the year to cut costs. The chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, is trying to reduce expenses by $1 billion a year. The company, based in Charlotte, N.C., expects the economy to remain weak next year, and ''it is obvious that we can't meet our 2003 budget without affecting the personnel line,'' Tim Arnoult, technology and operations executive, said in a memo to employees on Monday. Bank of America has eliminated 9,689 jobs, or 6.7 percent of its work force, over the last year.
11/18/2002	The Corporations Behind the Curtain: Six Supporters of the Arts	Support of the arts has become an integral part of the philanthropy programs of corporations nationwide; for some company foundations, arts support constitutes more than 30 percent of their total giving. Here is a look at six notable companies that are regarded as important forces in the giving field, though there are dozens more that offer comparable programs. The figures supplied are for the companies' philanthropic foundations, unless otherwise noted. BEN SISARIO
10/28/2002	Bank of America Chooses Interpublic	The Bank of America, concluding an unusual review of its estimated $170 million advertising account, has awarded the bulk of the business to agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. The decision, to be formally announced today, is a major victory for New York-based Interpublic. The agency company has recently come under pressure from investors because of earnings shortfalls and operational problems at some of its agencies, particularly a sports marketing unit called Octagon. On Friday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Interpublic debt, saying the advertising company's cash flow was not sufficient to pay for acquisitions and dividends and pay down debt. A loss in the review, and the subsequent departure of the Bank of America business Interpublic already had, would have been another blow to the company.
10/24/2002	Guilty Plea Is Expected From Trader	John M. Rusnak, the Baltimore currency trader who is accused of hiding losses of $691 million at Allfirst Financial for five years, will plead guilty today to bank fraud charges. The office of the United States attorney for Maryland said yesterday that it would announce a guilty plea today ''in a significant financial fraud case involving Allfirst Bank.'' The statement did not name Mr. Rusnak but no one else has been indicted in the case.
10/16/2002	STOCKS SHRUG OFF RECENT BATTERING WITH A BIG SURGE	Stocks soared almost 5 percent yesterday as investors celebrated upbeat earnings reports from two of the nation's biggest financial institutions and began to shift their views from gloomy to hopeful on other companies' prospects. In a four-day rally, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen almost 1,000 points, the biggest four-day move in almost 70 years.
9/11/2002	Many Chiefs Are Retaining Extra Benefits In Retirement	Often described as a model for chief executives, John F. Welch Jr. appears to have also created the model employment contract. The contract that Mr. Welch signed in 1996 as chief executive of General Electric was full of benefits that continue to flow to him in retirement. It quickly became a template for other executives to use to negotiate their own contracts, people in the field of executive pay say.
9/10/2002	Bank of America Asks Agencies to Compete	Bank of America in Charlotte, N.C., asked the parent companies of agencies that work for it to assemble teams to compete for assignments that make up most of its account, with spending estimated at $165 million to $170 million. A spokesman for Bank of America, Brad Russell, confirmed reports of the review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek. The competition will pit teams from agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York against teams from agencies owned by the Omnicom Group in New York for tasks on ads for consumer banking and ads aimed at affluent customers.
8/13/2002	Texas Pacific Hopes to Revive Another Airline	The airline industry's rescue squad is at work again. The Texas Pacific Group, the private equity firm that took Continental Airlines and America West out of bankruptcy nearly a decade ago, is putting its money behind US Airways. Led by David Bonderman, a former lieutenant of the investor Robert Bass, the firm considers the airline industry deeply cyclical and aims to ride the good times and exit before another slump.
8/8/2002	U.S. ADDS CHARGES AGAINST EX-CHIEF OF DRUG COMPANY	Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of ImClone Systems, was indicted yesterday on charges of insider trading, bank fraud, forging a signature and destroying records to obstruct a federal investigation. The indictment, unsealed in Federal District Court in Manhattan and announced by the United States attorney's office, contained new charges that had not been made when Dr. Waksal was arrested in June. One of those accuses Dr. Waksal of defrauding Bank of America by pledging ImClone securities he no longer owned as collateral for $44 million in loans. When the bank asked for proof that he still owned the securities, Dr. Waksal provided a false document on which he had forged the signature of ImClone's general counsel, according to the indictment.
7/30/2002	AT&T and AOL Are Said to Seek Delay in Evaluation of Joint Entertainment Unit	Locked in talks over the fate of their joint venture of Time Warner Entertainment, AT&T and AOL Time Warner agreed yesterday to ask Bank of America to withhold its opinion on how much AT&T's stake is worth, according to executives close to the companies. The request was a sign that the companies expect to reach a settlement within weeks on dissolving the venture. While AOL has tried to persuade AT&T to swap its 27.3 percent of Time Warner Entertainment for a stake in a newly created Time Warner Cable operation, AT&T wants at least $1 billion in cash and billions of dollars in stock in the parent AOL Time Warner in addition to a stake in the cable subsidiary, according to people close to the negotiations.
7/29/2002	AT&T Asks $1 Billion of AOL Time Warner	AT&T is seeking at least $1 billion in cash from AOL Time Warner as a condition for accepting AOL's plan for dissolving the Time Warner Entertainment joint venture, according to people close to the negotiations. Responding to a request from the two companies, Bank of America is expected to deliver an opinion today on how much AT&T's stake in T.W.E. is worth and on how much of that stake investors could be expected to buy in a public offering. The bank's determination will form a basis for additional negotiations as AT&T and AOL Time Warner try to unravel their venture, which includes the HBO pay-television operation, the Warner Brothers film studio and most of AOL Time Warner's cable-TV systems.
7/25/2002	Arnell Group Gets Bank of America Job	The Bank of America has expanded its relationship with the Omnicom Group by selecting the Arnell Group in New York to handle a new worldwide identity assignment, integrating such things as the appearance of locations, bank statements and technology. Terms were not disclosed. The bank also works with two other Omnicom agencies in New York: BBDO Worldwide, which is introducing an investment service program for its asset management group; and Doremus, which handles its business-to-business advertising.
7/16/2002	Results Take Opposite Paths at 2 Large Banks	FleetBoston Financial posted a second-quarter loss yesterday after writing off $1.3 billion to shut its investment bank and cover defaulted debt in Argentina, while Bank of America said profit climbed 10 percent on an increase in deposits and home mortgages. FleetBoston shares fell $1.62, or nearly 6 percent, to $27.42, after it reported a $386 million loss.
7/2/2002	BBDO Wins Job For Bank of America	The Bank of America has awarded a new assignment, without a review, to the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. The assignment, with billings that have not been determined, is to create a campaign to introduce an investment service program early next year for the bank's asset management group, which is based in New York. Scott Scredon, a spokesman for the Bank of America, confirmed reports of the assignment in the online editions of Advertising Age and Adweek. He declined to discuss details of the service. Bozell in New York, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, remains agency of record, Mr. Scredon said.
6/27/2002	Company Was Trying to Nearly Double Amount of Loans	WorldCom owes its lenders $2.65 billion, but it could have been worse. At the time the company disclosed that it had overstated its profits, it was negotiating to increase its outstanding loans to $5 billion. WorldCom's banks may still be willing to lend money, but they will probably require the loans to be secured by WorldCom assets, an executive close to the lenders said. The banks may also prefer that any additional financing be part of a bankruptcy filing.
6/6/2002	Former Trader Indicted On Bank Fraud Charges	The currency trader who hid losses of $691 million for five years was indicted today on seven counts involving bank fraud and making false financial entries. The indictment charged that the trader, John M. Rusnak, used fictitious trades and false trade confirmations to hide losses at Allfirst Financial here and to make it appear that he was actually making a profit as a currency trader.
5/31/2002	Equity Chief Is Chosen	The Bank of America Corporation said yesterday that it had named Jon Sandelman as its head of global equities, a new position created to help the bank win back stock underwriting business lost in the last year to Citigroup and other rivals. Mr. Sandelman, 44, was global head of equity derivatives at Salomon Brothers before joining the Bank of America in 1998.
5/18/2002	New Questions Are Turning Up In the Inquiry Into Adelphia	Investigations into accounting problems at Adelphia Communications are turning up a far broader number of questionable transactions between the company and its controlling family than had been apparent at first, an executive close to the situation said yesterday. Adelphia had a financial involvement, for example, in the Rigas family's purchase of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team, this person said. Other such dealings that have already been disclosed include the company's financing of a golf course built by the family.
5/16/2002	3 Ex-Chiefs Discover Perils Of Borrowing and Believing	They were among the corporate elite, three chief executives who made millions and were the leading citizens of their communities. Now they find themselves out of work and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt -- all because they were wrongly confident that their companies would never falter. Perhaps they should be known as the borrowing believers. Yesterday John J. Rigas, who appears to have incurred by far the largest debt of any of them -- well above a billion dollars -- was forced to step down as chief executive of Adelphia Communications, a cable television company that is mired in a scandal set off by the belated disclosure of the loans to Mr. Rigas and his family.
4/28/2002	Bank of America Weighs Limit on Severance Pay	Shareholders of the Bank of America Corporation have approved a recommendation to limit severance pay for executives to twice their annual compensation. If any package exceeded that limit, shareholders would have to give their specific O.K. It is the first time that shareholders of a major corporation have endorsed such a measure, according to Patrick S. McGurn, vice president of Institutional Shareholders Services. Similar resolutions are pending at about a dozen other companies, he said.
4/18/2002	5 Men, One With Political Connections, Are Indicted in $42 Million Bank and Tax Fraud	Federal prosecutors announced charges yesterday against a politically connected Manhattan businessman and his partner, accusing them and three of their hotel business associates of defrauding five banks of more than $42 million. The Manhattan businessman, Stanley S. Tollman, and his partner, Monty D. Hundley, are accused of running a complex scheme with the help of an employee, an accountant and a lawyer to avoid repaying tens of millions of dollars they had borrowed from banks to build their hotel business.
4/16/2002	Losses in Argentina Reduce Citigroup's Earnings	Despite the continuing strong performance of its consumer business, Citigroup reported first-quarter earnings yesterday that fell short of analysts' estimates, in large part because of greater-than-expected losses in Argentina. Citigroup posted net income of $4.8 billion, or 93 cents a share, up 37 percent from $3.54 billion, or 69 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Results in the latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $1.06 billion on the initial public offering last month of the Travelers Property Casualty subsidiary.
4/8/2002	Enron Investors Say Lenders Took Part in Fraud Scheme	In an expanded lawsuit expected to be filed today, Enron shareholders accuse some of the country's top financial institutions of knowingly participating in a scheme to defraud them, adding new details about deals involving banks and investment firms that kept Enron afloat even as its finances were falling apart. According to a draft of the complaint, a group of nine financial institutions repeatedly structured deals to funnel millions of dollars in cash to Enron and a series of related partnerships, all to allow transactions that improperly increased Enron's profits and hid debt. In many of those transactions, the complaint says, senior bank officers themselves secretly invested in the partnerships, receiving quick, outsized profits for participating in deals that disguised Enron's true financial health.
4/5/2002	ADELPHIA HIRES 3 INVESTMENT BANKS AS ADVISERS	Adelphia Communications hired three Wall Street investment banks yesterday to advise it as it considers asset sales to pay down debt, the company said yesterday. Adelphia has retained the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, Bank of America and Credit Suisse First Boston as financial advisers. The decision to proceed with a possible asset sale comes amid revelations last week that the Rigas family, which controls the company, borrowed at least $2.3 billion from banks in which Adelphia guaranteed the loans without recording that fact on the books. Andrew Ross Sorkin (NYT)
3/23/2002	BANKS GIVE CONSECO MORE TIME TO MAKE DEBT PAYMENT	A group of banks gave Conseco, the insurance and finance company, more time to repay $1.5 billion of debt in exchange for a higher interest rate. The banks, led by J. P. Morgan Chase and the Bank of America, also approved a plan by Conseco to swap up to $2.54 billion of new bonds for existing securities. The new debt will mature in one to two and a half years. The agreement may help Conseco avert a credit-rating downgrade, which would raise borrowing costs as the company repays about $6.1 billion in debt.
3/15/2002	Bank Report Says Trader Had Bold Plot	The Baltimore currency trader who hid losses of $691 million over five years was ''unusually clever and devious'' -- and also bold, according to the internal report of his activities released yesterday by Allied Irish Banks of Dublin. The trader, John M. Rusnak, was faced with the unraveling of his trades on Jan. 31 when he was confronted with fake trades that could not be confirmed by his bank, Allfirst Financial of Baltimore, a subsidiary of Allied Irish.
3/14/2002	Hewlett Gets A Big Backer In Its Quest For Compaq	In one of the largest endorsements yet of its $24 billion planned acquisition of Compaq Computer, the Hewlett-Packard Company today received a vow that Putnam Investments, one of its biggest institutional shareholders, would vote for the merger. Though hinted at in January by Michael Capellas, the chief executive of Compaq, the decision came as a boost to Hewlett-Packard's campaign against its dissident director, Walter B. Hewlett, who is leading a proxy fight against the deal.
3/5/2002	How Trail of Big Currency Losses Remained Uncovered for 5 Years	Things were getting hot last year for John M. Rusnak, a currency trader at a Baltimore bank, which now says that he hid $691 million in losses over five years. He was not sleeping well, according to someone who knows him, and he needed cash to conceal his growing losses. He had managed to sweep $211 million of losses under the rug in 2000, according to the bank, on top of $90 million in losses the three previous years.
2/27/2002	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about the cooperation of Citibank and Bank of America the investigation of a currency trader in Maryland whose employer says he tried to hide huge losses misstated the amount lost by the trader. It was $691 million, not billion.
2/26/2002	2 U.S. Banks Vow to Assist Allfirst Case	Two large banks that have special trading agreements with the currency trader who lost $691 billion said yesterday that they were cooperating with the investigation. In addition, government investigators have subpoenaed records connected to their transactions and communications with the trader. Citibank and Bank of America are both being scrutinized because they had what are called prime brokerage agreements with the trader, John M. Rusnak, who worked for Allfirst Financial in Baltimore, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks of Dublin. Mr. Rusnak's employers say he hid his losses in part by using fictitious trades.
2/14/2002	Investigation Into Rogue Trades Finds Red Flags but Few Details	The currency trader who lost $750 million at a regional Maryland bank was so successful in counterfeiting proof of bogus trades that his bank was frantically trying to verify six-month-old trades the day before the suspected fraud was made public, foreign exchange traders said yesterday. The trader, John M. Rusnak, also had agreements with at least two big banks -- Bank of America and Citibank -- that essentially allowed him to use their names when making trades. Traders are not clear why he did this or why the regional bank, Allfirst Financial, needed such extra backing in the foreign exchange market. But these agreements may have helped Mr. Rusnak conceal his activities, traders said.
2/9/2002	BANK OF AMERICA SETTLES SUITS BY SHAREHOLDERS	The Bank of America Corporation agreed to pay $490 million to settle lawsuits claiming it hid losses from loans to a hedge fund before combining with the NationsBank Corporation in 1998. Shareholders accused Bank of America of concealing a write-off of $372 million stemming from a loan to the hedge fund, D. E. Shaw & Company of New York. Some plaintiffs' lawyers said bank executives hid the losses because they did not want to derail NationsBank's purchase of BankAmerica. The bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., did not admit any wrongdoing under the settlement.
1/31/2002	Agency Will Sue for Records Of Cheney Energy Meetings	The General Accounting Office said today that it would sue the White House to try to force Vice President Dick Cheney to release documents detailing contacts between corporate executives and the administration's energy task force. In a letter to the White House and Congressional leaders, David M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States and director of the accounting office, said he intended to ask a federal judge to order Mr. Cheney to give Congress the identities of energy industry executives who helped the Bush administration formulate a national energy policy last year. Mr. Walker said he was also seeking the subject that each executive discussed with task force members. Mr. Cheney was the chairman of the task force.

7/17/2001	2 Large Banks Beat Estimates For Earnings; Another Slips	Lower interest rates bolstered second-quarter results at Citigroup and Bank of America even as their businesses showed some weakness from the softer economy. But Bank of New York, which has comparatively little exposure to lending, surprised investors with lower-than-expected earnings. Citigroup reported earnings before nonrecurring charges and accounting changes of $3.79 billion, or 74 cents a share, a penny ahead of analysts' expectations. It had net income of $3.5 billion, or 69 cents a share, compared with $3.34 billion, or 65 cents a share in the second quarter last year.
7/8/2001	A Longtime Star Hopes It's a Short-Term Slump	THOMAS F. MARSICO, a star stock picker who had a knack for spotting small technology companies on the verge of becoming big hits, had become used to highflying returns -- but now he has seen his large-capitalization growth funds take a nose dive. His flagship $1.8 billion Marsico Focus fund was down 14.68 percent in the first half of this year, and the $692 million Marsico Growth and Income fund was down 12.85 percent. That compares with a loss of 6.7 percent for the the Standard & Poor's 500.

1/17/2001	THE MARKETS: Market Place; 2 Banks Report Profits in Line With Estimates	Bank of America and Citigroup kept the rally in bank stocks alive yesterday as each reported profits that met expectations. Bank stocks have risen since the Federal Reserve's decision earlier this month to cut interest rates, but concerns have remained about the possibility of unexpected loan losses and weakening business as the economy slows. Investors were particularly nervous about Bank of America, which had sharply lowered earnings estimates last month, citing bigger loan losses.
12/12/2000	Top Executive to Leave Bank of America	The Bank of America Corporation said yesterday that one of its top lending executives had left the company. The executive, Thomas Bunn, was the longtime head of leveraged lending, or financings for companies with ratings below investment grade. His departure was unexpected, and Mr. Bunn himself was taken by surprise, according to a Wall Street executive with contacts at the bank who said Mr. Bunn learned of his departure when contacted by a reporter from a news service.
11/16/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place; 2 Banks Struggle With a Single Troubled Debtor	Bank of America and First Union are warning about potential write-offs in the fourth quarter related to a single borrower, raising anxiety among investors about possible credit problems at commercial banks. In their third-quarter financial statements, released earlier this week, both companies made references to a single loan to a troubled company. While neither bank would identify the borrower, analysts and investors think the banks were referring to the Sunbeam Corporation, the household and consumer products company that is struggling to recover from accounting irregularities discovered two years ago.
11/2/2000	I.B.M. AND BANKS PLAN CHECK SYSTEM	Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank of America and I.B.M. have established a venture called Viewpointe Archive Services to store electronic images of checks using technology developed by I.B.M. and Chase. The companies said that the shared archive would be marketed to all banks as a way to speed check clearing, which now takes up to 12 steps, and that such centralized imaging could cut check processing costs by up to 30 percent. Banks on the system could also use it to give customers access to electronic copies of their checks over the Internet. Viewpointe expects to eventually expand beyond checks to archiving other bank transactions. Barnaby J. Feder
9/26/2000	THE MARKETS: Market Place -- The Analyst as Bomb Thrower; Thomas Brown Has an Attitude, One He Likes to Share	For years, Thomas K. Brown threw verbal darts in a profession known for cozy collegiality. A top-rated stock analyst, he frequently blasted top bankers who were stringing together mergers at prices he believed were too high. Mr. Brown so irritated Edward Crutchfield Jr., the former chief executive of the First Union Corporation -- he once said Mr. Crutchfield ''never saw an acquisition proposal he didn't like'' -- that Mr. Crutchfield dismissed the freckle-faced Mr. Brown as ''that little red-haired boy.''
9/8/2000	RESTORATION HARDWARE SHARES FALL ON FINANCE NEWS	Shares of Restoration Hardware Inc. fell about 20 percent yesterday after the company, a furniture retailer, said it had hired an investment bank to help it find additional sources of financing. Investors interpreted the news as a sign of cash problems. The company, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., said it had hired Bank of America to help it get financing.

The company said it was seeking to reschedule about $766 million in bank debt that is maturing this month. The company, based in Carmel, Ind., said last month that it expected to raise $2 billion from asset sales but it would need up to 15 months to do it. Moody's cut Conseco's senior debt rating last month by one notch, to B1, from Ba3, citing uncertainty about how much the company could raise from asset sales. Conseco stock fell 54 cents, or 6 percent, to $8.46 yesterday.

Middle-level and senior managers are expected to be the principal targets of the job cutback, along with workers whose jobs will be erased by new technology.

Marsico said it would continue to operate as it currently does, making large investments in a few well-capitalized companies.
5/21/2000	A Powerful Banker's Other Hat	HUGH L. McCOLL Jr., chairman and chief executive of Bank of America, was on the warpath again. ''I'll be damned if anyone calls me 'gutless,' '' he said as he stalked the newsroom of the local paper, looking for the writer who used that word to describe business leaders like him in a column on downtown revitalization. With the same determination he has brought to building the nation's largest bank, Mr. McColl, in the home state of Sen. Jesse Helms, has braved the opposition of local politicians and some of his shareholders to pursue civic goals that he frankly describes as liberal.
5/15/2000	Bank of America Says It Is Planning To Open Israel Office	The Bank of America Corporation said today that it planned to open an office in Israel to serve the country's growing computer, telecommunications and other technology businesses.

CheckFree shares rose $14.8125, or 37 percent, to $54.375.
4/18/2000	First-Quarter Earnings Beat Expectations At 2 Banks	Bank of America and Bank of New York reported first-quarter profits yesterday that beat expectations, powered by surging stocks. After last week's sell-off, however, they might be hard-pressed to post similarly strong future results.
3/5/2000	When the Company Asks for Volunteers	In ''Playing It the Company Way, After Hours'' (The Right Thing, Feb. 20), Jeffrey Seglin looked at the ethical issues raised when a company asks its employees to volunteer their time and services, referring specifically to Bank of America's recent attempt to ask its workers to maintain the cleanliness of its automated teller machines.

2/20/2000	Playing It the Company Way, After Hours	MANAGEMENT at the Bank of America thought it had a winner. In a program called ''Adopt an A.T.M.,'' begun last June, the bank asked employees to volunteer to look after one of its automated teller machines and to keep the machine's surroundings gleaming with pride -- on their own time and without pay. ''We thought it was a great idea,'' said Kieth Cockrell, executive vice president in Charlotte, N.C., of the bank's credit, debit and smart-card division, which oversaw the program. More than 2,800 of the bank's 158,900 workers signed up to adopt one of the bank's more than 10,000 teller machines.
1/19/2000	Banks Post Higher 4th-Quarter Profits	The Bank of America Corporation, J. P. Morgan & Company and other United States banks posted higher fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, driven by investment-banking fees and trading.

12/21/1999	Forecasts Made Rosy for Investors, But Results Are Sometimes Paler	A penny is not worth much nowadays except, oddly enough, on Wall Street. There, a penny a share in company earnings can mean the difference between a stock that soars and one that skids. The punishment that stocks regularly endure from investors disappointed over the tiniest earnings misses has put managements under pressure to deliver upbeat earnings announcements even if the numbers do not support them. The result, according to some Wall Street accounting experts, is a disturbing trend. More and more companies, they say, are going to extremes to paint a rosy picture of their operations.
10/19/1999	Citigroup, Exceeding Forecasts, Reports a Big Rebound in Its Profit for Third Quarter	Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company, said yesterday that its third-quarter profit had more than tripled as its banking and trading businesses rebounded from weak performances a year earlier, when global financial turmoil hurt big banks and securities firms. A combination of rising revenue and sharp cost-cutting helped improve results for virtually every segment of Citigroup's far-flung operations, from making consumer loans to trading bonds through its Salomon Smith Barney investment-banking unit. At the rate it has been going in 1999, Citigroup will end the year with nearly $10 billion in profit.
7/7/1999	Clinton, in Poverty Tour, Focuses on Profits	Nothing motivates business like the prospect of profits. That is the fundamental message underlying President Clinton's tour of the nation's impoverished precincts this week. Government tax credits and loan guarantees are fine as far as they go, Mr. Clinton says at each stop, but corporations are not going to invest in the Kentucky highlands, the Mississippi Delta or poor East St. Louis without hope of a decent return.
7/1/1999	Banks Raise Prime Rates	The Bank of America Corporation, the biggest United States bank; the No. 2 Chase Manhattan Corporation; the Bank One Corporation, and Keycorp raised their prime rates to 8 percent from 7.75 percent yesterday after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time since March 1997.

6/24/1999	BANK OF AMERICA TO BUY BACK UP TO 130 MILLION SHARES	The Bank of America Corporation, the nation's largest bank, said yesterday that it would buy back up to 130 million shares, or about $9.3 billion, of its stock.

6/12/1999	Big Bank Says It Won't Share Customer Data	As concern about consumer privacy issues heightens, the Bank of America Corporation, one of the country's largest banks, said yesterday that it was adopting new rules about the use of personal information by its customers. The bank said it would no longer share any customer information -- including addresses, telephone numbers and credit card account numbers -- with outside vendors such as telemarketers. And, it would no longer maintain relationships with vendors of nonfinancial products, such as vacation packages and dining club memberships. It will also act as a middleman for the vendors selling financial products.
6/11/1999	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Owning and Leasing; Leases Without Wear-and-Tear Fees	EARLY one of every three consumers who lease cars or trucks incur substantial charges for dings, dents and chips when they return their vehicles, because the damage is considered beyond what the leasing company considers normal and reasonable. Consumers often cite such surcharges for ''excess wear and tear'' as a reason they choose not to lease again when their old contracts run out. Leasing now accounts for about a third of new-vehicle sales.
5/17/1999	Bank of America Settles Charges on Bonds	The Bank of America Corporation will pay $187.5 million to settle charges it illegally kept unclaimed bond proceeds from the State of California and more than 1,000 cities, counties and public agencies statewide.

5/4/1999	Ruling Narrows Rights of Debtors	Banks and insurers won new leverage in bankruptcy proceedings today when the United States Supreme Court ruled that judges should not give the owner of an insolvent company an exclusive right to buy a stake in a reorganized business. The 8-1 decision in favor of a subsidiary of the Bank of America Corporation is good news for banks, insurance companies and other creditors because it will let them take over many bankrupt businesses, particularly failed real estate ventures, and auction them to the highest bidder.
11/13/1998	Bank of America Settles Suits From California	Bank of America agreed today to pay $187.5 million to settle charges by California state and local governments that it mishandled hundreds of millions of dollars of bond payments between 1978 and 1995. The bank said it would compensate the state and 300 city governments and local agencies that accused it of systematically pocketing unclaimed bondholder payments that should have been returned to the authorities to use to build schools, hospitals and roads.
8/26/1998	I.M.F. Lets Its Rule on Full Repayment Slip	Pummeled by Asia and now Russia, the International Monetary Fund is gradually softening its policies, becoming more tolerant of arrangements it would have rejected a year ago -- and even allowing some Asian debtors not to repay all they owe to foreign banks. Now the Russian Government is pushing this process of favoring the country in crisis a step or two further.
1/18/1998	His Nervous Behavior Gave Man Away	The attempted escape of a third suspect in last week's World Trade Center bank robbery was foiled on a train trip in New Mexico by drug enforcement agents who thought the fugitive's nervous demeanor and the amount of cash in his possession fit the profile of a drug trafficker. The suspect, Richard Gillette, 39, was taken into custody after a long ride on an Amtrak train bound for San Bernardino, Calif. He was being held yesterday in a New Mexico jail while awaiting a hearing before a United States magistrate in Albuquerque on Tuesday. He will later be returned to New York, to join Melvin Desmond Folk and Michael Reed in facing Federal bank-robbing charges, according to agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
1/17/1998	Lie-Detector Results of Brinks Guards Raising Questions	The Brinks security guards robbed of more than $1 million Tuesday at the World Trade Center did not perform well on lie detector tests given shortly after the incident, law enforcement officials said yesterday. Meanwhile, the third suspect in the robbery, Richard Gillette, was apprehended last night after he briefly left a Los Angeles-bound Amtrak train during a 30-minute layover in Albuquerque, N.M., the authorities in New Mexico said.
1/16/1998	Two Suspects Are Arrested In Robbery at Trade Center	Two of the three men suspected of stealing more than $1 million from security guards making a delivery in the World Trade Center have been arrested, law enforcement officials said yesterday, adding that they were closing in on the third suspect. Although it is unclear how the suspects got past security at the twin skyscrapers to carry out the robbery Tuesday morning, an investigator said yesterday that it appeared all three entered through the front door, with at least two of the men flashing fake identification cards to the guards patrolling there. The investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the inquiry was now focusing on how the robbery was planned and whether it was the work of someone who did not participate in the robbery itself but paid the others to commit the crime.
1/15/1998	Tips on Bank Robbers Lead Police to Brooklyn	Police investigators began scouring the Windsor Terrace section of Brooklyn yesterday after receiving dozens of tips from residents who said they knew the three suspects wanted in Tuesday's $1.6 million bank robbery at the World Trade Center. According to the Police Department, more than 56 people called investigators yesterday after pictures of the suspects were printed in local newspapers and shown on television. Nearly all of the calls came from residents of Windsor Terrace, said investigators, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
1/14/1998	3 Gunmen Rob Guards of $1.6 Million at World Trade Center Bank	Three armed men got past security yesterday morning in the World Trade Center, disarmed two Brink's guards delivering money to a currency exchange center there and then fled with with $1.6 million, the authorities said. The robbery came nearly five years after the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey tightened security at the complex in response to the terrorist bombing on Feb. 26, 1993, which killed 6 people and injured more than 1,000. Since then, all people entering the complex's elevators have had to show identification, though they do not have to pass through metal detectors.
12/24/1997	Claire Giannini Hoffman, Bank of America Director, 92	Claire Giannini Hoffman, the first woman to serve on the boards of Bank of America and Sears, Roebuck & Company, died Monday of respiratory failure at her home in San Mateo, Calif., the bank said.

11/10/1997	Taking In the Sites ; On-Line Banking Doesn't Always Cover the Basics	Nearly all of the big banks now offer some sort of on-line banking. But in their frenzy to provide their customers with the ability to zap their money all over the world, many of the most sophisticated banks have forgotten to answer even the most basic questions about their services. Take Citibank, for example, which has just introduced an elaborate, if excruciatingly slow, Internet banking service. Its World Wide Web site does not say what the fees and balance requirements are for its checking accounts.
7/24/1997	GSD&M Is Named By Bank of America	Bank of America in San Francisco has named GSD&M in Austin, Tex., to handle the broadcast media buying portion of its account, with billings estimated at $20 million to $25 million. The account was previously handled on an interim basis by the New York and Santa Monica, Calif., offices of Deutsch Inc. The decision came after a six-month review that had been narrowed to GSD&M, which is owned by GGT Group, and one other finalist, Carat North America in New York, part of the Aegis Group P.L.C. Deutsch continues to handle the creative and planning portions of the account.

The gun battle, which raged for the better part of an hour, also left 10 police officers and five passers-by injured, some hit by bullets, others hurt while speeding to and from the scene in cars. All were expected to recover.
12/11/1996	Bank of America Picks Finalists	The Bank of America unit of the BankAmerica Corporation has named four finalists to compete for its combined corporate image and retail accounts, with billings estimated at $50 million to $70 million.

11/9/1996	Deals Looming To Establish U.S. Ventures In Cash Cards	Three groups of banks and credit card companies are racing to complete deals in the next few weeks involving so-called smart cards -- cards embedded with microchips that can store electronic cash and other data. Next week, Mastercard International is expected to invest about $160 million to buy a 51 percent interest in Mondex, an electronic cash system developed in Britain, according to people familiar with the transaction. Spokesmen for both Mastercard and Mondex confirmed that the companies were in negotiations but declined to comment on the details of those talks.
9/10/1996	I.B.M. and Big Banks in Home Service Deal	I.B.M. and a group of big banks said yesterday that they had formed a venture that the banks hoped would improve their ability to offer services through home computers and other devices.

It was introduced with an elaborate news conference in New York with promises about its vast potential.
5/22/1996	Time Is Changing The Model S.& L.;Home Savings Pushes Ahead Into Full-Service Banking	"The bright California sun filters through the stained-glass windows, creating a reverential mood in this cavernous edifice. Decorated with elaborate mosaics, bronze statues and lots of marble, it is a stolid temple of thrift -- one of many erected by Home Savings of America in affluent suburbs like this one, outside Los Angeles, in the years after World War II. The ornate branches gathered enough of the growing wealth of Southern California to make Home Savings the nation's largest and in many ways most successful savings and loan. But on this spring afternoon, a slender banner dangling over a half-dozen tellers bears a simple announcement: """"We now offer home equity, automotive, personal loans and credit lines."
10/11/1995	A California savings and loan takes some shots at the big banks, and meets with  apparent success.	"IN the typically genteel world of financial-institution advertising, tradition remains important. Messages suggest stability and financial might, most making no claim bolder than """"Our C.D. Rates Add Up to Big Numbers."""" Comparisons are indirect, if at all. But in California, one institution is rewriting those rules. Glendale Federal Bank has ditched gentility for a bare-knuckle attack, spending $16 million to specifically take on the state's biggest banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, in a contentious campaign by the BBDO West unit of the Omnicom Group in Los Angeles."
8/23/1995	Checks Delivered Via E-Mail Are Planned	"Pretty soon it won't be, """"The check is in the mail""""; it will be, """"The check is in the E-mail."""" A group of banks and technology companies said yesterday that they would design a system to create """"electronic checks"""" that could be used to make payments over the Internet or other electronic mail systems. The system would let a couple pay their phone bill by sending a payment to the telephone company over electronic mail, or they could send an electronic check to a child for a birthday present. A person or company receiving an electronic check could immediately deposit it in a bank, also via electronic mail."
4/29/1995	3 Big Banks Favor Keeping Equal-Lending Law	Three of the nation's four biggest banking companies and the largest savings institution broke ranks today with the rest of the industry, distancing themselves from Republican bills to effectively repeal big sections of the Federal law that requires banks to lend in poor neighborhoods. Officials of the Bank of America, Chemical Bank, Nationsbank and Home Savings of America, a unit of H. F. Ahmanson & Company, announced at a news conference here today with community-group representatives that they supported last week's revision of Federal community-lending regulations. The Clinton Administration and the Federal Reserve approved the changes, which eased many paperwork requirements of the basic law, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.
4/13/1995	Market Opening on Internet For Pollution-Credit Trades	An electronic market for trading pollution credits from Southern California is to begin operating today on the Internet, offering a system that its developers believe will help businesses reduce pollution at the lowest possible cost. Its developers, scientists from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, hope their automated environmental credit exchange, as it is known, will supplant a rival auction market begun last year by Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., a Wall Street brokerage firm.
4/8/1995	MIRAGE RESORTS SAYS BANKS HAVE INCREASED CREDIT LINE	Mirage Resorts Inc. said yesterday that Bank of America and 19 other banks had increased the company's bank credit line to $1 billion from $525 million at 7.125 percent. Mirage will use some of the money to finance its previously announced call of the last $126 million of 9.875 percent Treasure Island casino bonds. Mirage will also use some of the money to start construction this year on its planned Beau Rivage casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip, which may cost $1 billion.
2/10/1995	The Black Entrepreneur At a Firestorm's Center	Just a few weeks ago, Frank Washington thought he had reached the pinnacle of success among black entrepreneurs. The son of middle-class parents who was born in a segregated hospital in the District of Columbia 47 years ago, Mr. Washington had an agreement to buy a large set of cable television properties from Viacom Inc. for $2.3 billion. But today, far from being lionized, he is at the center of a political firestorm, attacked as a front man for white-owned media conglomerates. His deal has been held up as a symbol of how a Federal program to help minority-owned companies has been abused, leading the House Ways and Means Committee to vote on Wednesday to repeal the program entirely and specifically block Mr. Washington's cable deal.
12/15/1994	Salomon Will Start Selling Orange County Debt Today	Orange County yesterday began the slow, hard work of rescuing itself from the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history. In one sign of that effort, Salomon Brothers prepared to auction off the first $1 billion of the bonds that remain in the Southern California county's ill-fated investment portfolio. In another sign, a Federal bankruptcy judge approved resumption of normal banking services with the Bank of America, the county's commercial bank. The judge authorized the bank to maintain a $200 million loan agreement so that the county could meet its $16.4 million automatic payroll deposit tomorrow.
10/25/1994	A Mortgage Penalty, or a Plus?	What sounds like a consumer-friendly provision -- the prohibition in many states of penalties for homeowners who pay off their mortgages early -- actually raises the cost of mortgages, experts in housing finance say. And that has the effect of forcing low-income home buyers to subsidize high-income home buyers, they add. The problem, the experts say, is that lenders demand higher interest rates and higher fees on new mortgages with no prepayment penalty because they are not sure how soon the mortgage will be repaid. So all the homeowners who never pay off mortgages early, because they did not move or refinance, wind up paying for a benefit they do not use.
9/30/1994	COMPANY BRIEFS	BANKAMERICA CORP., San Francisco, said its Bank of America subsidiary would provide banking services in nearly 400 Lucky Stores Inc. outlets in California. CONSECO INC., Carmel, Ind., said its Conseco Capital Partners II L.P. unit had completed the acquisition of Statesman Group Inc., Des Moines, in a transaction valued at about $350 million.
8/20/1994	Bank of America Is Upheld On Customer Arbitration	A California judge has upheld the Bank of America's requirement that its checking account and credit-card customers use arbitration rather than the courts to settle complaints, a decision that has broad implications for the way banks resolve disputes with their depositors. The ruling, which will affect about 12.4 million of the bank's clients, was released late on Thursday by Judge Thomas J. Mellon of the state's Superior Court in San Francisco. It followed a three-week trial that ended in May.
7/7/1993	BANK OF AMERICA OPENS BRANCH IN GUANGZHOU, CHINA	Bank of America, anxious to profit from booming trade in southern China, yesterday became the first American bank to open a branch in the city of Guangzhou. The bank will now be able to offer services in the growing province of Guangdong, including trade finance, credit checks, money transfers and investment advice. Bank of America currently operates a branch in Shanghai, and a representative office in Beijing. The bank is also conducting feasibility studies on a possible branch in northern China. Harry Garschagen, manager for the China market, said the bank is considering the cities of Dalian or Tian Jin.
5/6/1993	Another Outsider Is Appointed at I.B.M.	As Louis V. Gerstner Jr. has started overhauling I.B.M.'s top corporate staff this week, the people he's bringing in look a lot like Lou Gerstner: outsiders to the computer industry but well-traveled finance experts with experience in turning around troubled enterprises. The company announced yesterday that Gerald M. Czarnecki, chairman of Bank of America's Hawaiian subsidiary, would become the International Business Machines Corporation's senior vice president for human resources and administration.
3/4/1993	3 Potential Tenants Reconsidering Move To the Trade Center	Three companies that had planned to move into large offices in the World Trade Center before the explosion last Friday are now reconsidering the move. The three companies had been negotiating for a total of 690,000 square feet, equivalent to 10 to 15 floors of office space. The companies -- Rollins Hudig Hall, Bank of America and Fiduciary Trust -- have now postponed those deals, while a construction consultant that was separately hired by all three, Bennis & Reissman, double-checks the Port Authority's own assessment of how long it will take to make the twin towers safe and functional.
8/27/1992	What Will Crawl Out of B.C.C.I. Rocks?	"To the Editor: """"B.C.C.I.'s Remorseless Web"""" (editorial, July 30) fails to cover the complete Bank of Credit and Commerce International spectrum, a fault common in news media reports. Yes, B.C.C.I. was founded by expatriate Pakistanis, most of whom were already experienced bankers operating out of the United Arab Emirates. However only 51 percent of the initial capital came from the Middle East. Bank of America was the founding joint venture partner. Despite this bank's strong support, many international financial institutions declined to make loans or place funds with B.C.C.I. because of doubts on the soundness of B.C.C.I.'s deposit base."
8/6/1992	In Budgetless California, a Sense of Business as Usual	On California's 36th day without a state budget, negotiations here are moving sluggishly, lawmakers are cranky, Gov. Pete Wilson's face is etched with strain and state workers are scrambling to cash the i.o.u.'s they are getting instead of paychecks. Today the Bank of America, the state's largest bank, stopped offering cash to its customers in exchange for the i.o.u.'s and several other banks are expected to follow suit at week's end.
7/24/1992	2d Big Bank Sets I.O.U. Deadline For California	"California's budget crisis deepened today when the Bank of America, the nation's second-largest bank and the biggest in the state, said that on Aug. 5 it would stop accepting the i.o.u.'s the state has been issuing employees and other creditors while Gov. Pete Wilson and legislators fight over the $11 billion deficit. Later, Wells Fargo Bank, the state's second-largest bank, reiterated its position that it would stop accepting the i.o.u.'s, or """"registered warrants,"""" dated after July 31."
5/29/1992	2 Banks Closing Branches	"As the Bank of America and the Security Pacific Bank move ahead with their merger, they have notified customers in four Western states of plans to close 82 branches by the fall. In Washington, 32 branches were closed over the weekend, and other closings in Nevada, Arizona and Oregon are expected by autumn. Branch closings in California, the home of the two merging banks, are not scheduled to start until September, according to Peter Magnani, a spokesman for the Bank of America. The San Francisco Chronicle said yesterday that the banks were planning to close 300 of their 1,435 California branches, but Mr. Magnani declined to confirm that report. """"When our plans are ready, we will give our customers 90 days' notice, then we will issue confirmations,"""" he said."
1/2/1992	Bank Robber Kills Himself After Creating Standoff in California	LEAD: A group of banks led by the Bank of America has extended its credit agreement with the Control Data Corporation and offered expanded borrowing privileges to the computer company. The agreement, first signed in July 1988, would have expired on Saturday.
7/4/1990	Credit Extension For Control Data	LEAD: Because of an editing error, a brief Company News article in Business Day yesterday referred incorrectly to the role of the Bank of America in a $1 billion loan to the MCI Communications Corporation. The bank is putting together a group of lenders to make the loan; it is not lending the entire amount.
4/26/1990	Corrections	LEAD: The Bank of America said it had agreed to make a $1 billion loan to finance the proposed acquisition of Telecom U.S.A. by the MCI Communications Corporation. MCI, based in Washington, will draw down part of its $500 million credit line with Bank of America to pay for the $1.25 billion transaction, which must still be approved by state and Federal regulators and Telecom's shareholders.
4/25/1990	MCI to Get Loan	The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Time Inc., Chemical Bank and the Bank of America said that they had banded together to offer home banking and brokerage services to customers nationwide. After receiving regulatory approval, the new service will initially be available to the 37,000 individual and small-business customers of the home banking services now offered separately by Chemical in New York and by Bank of America in California.
6/4/1985	Banking Venture	NORMALLY, when an employee performs sloppy work, it is up to the supervisor to notice the problem, and try to correct it, or, in extreme cases, to dismiss the employee. But in the last year, two groups of bank employees have faced much harsher punishment: their employers sued them for negligence. In both cases - one brought by Chase Manhattan in New York and the other by the Bank of America in California - the banks suffered serious losses because of their employees' decisions. But in both cases, the banks acknowledge that they have no evidence of fraud, no hint of criminality or intentional wrongdoing.
3/22/1985	Credit Card Fraud Case	Three Bank of America workers were arrested today in connection with a reported credit-card theft ring operating out of the bank's Southern California credit card center in suburban Pasadena, authorities said. Although this is the third investigation of credit card fraud at the center, it is the first time that Bank of America Credit Card employees have been implicated. Al Joaquin, a Secret Service spokesman, said credit cards and confidential card information on about 10,000 bank customers was stolen and sold.
3/14/1985	Spotlight On Deposit Brokering	In a new assault on brokered deposits, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today identified banks, thrift institutions and credit unions that had placed funds through money brokers in two banks that failed last month. Among the banks listed as having deposited funds in the failed banks through brokers were the Bank of America, the country's second-largest bank, and the Crocker National Bank, both of San Francisco. The announcement marked the first time that the deposit-insurance agency named institutions that have channeled money through brokers. It was a clear attempt to embarrass the named banks and other institutions that used money brokers to place their excess money where it would get high rates of return.
3/4/1985	LAWYER SAYS COAST BANK SUED TO GET INSURANCE	The lawyer for one of the Bank of America employees sued and dismissed by the bank Friday said this weekend that his client did nothing wrong and that the bank was merely trying to get insurance money. ''If they can succeed against any of the employees, they can collect on the insurance policy,'' said Laurie Belger, the lawyer representing Mary R. Brown. Mrs. Brown was one of six employees of the bank sued Friday for ''gross negligence'' for their role in a mortgage-backed securities scandal that led the bank to take a $95 million charge against 1984 earnings. Five of the employees, all of whom worked in the Los Angeles area, were dismissed and the sixth was demoted and reassigned.
3/2/1985	CALIFORNIA BANK SUES 6 IN LOSSES OVER MORTGAGES	The Bank of America sued six employees today, charging them with ''gross negligence'' for their involvement in a mortgage-backed securities scandal that has led to huge losses and embarrassment for the bank. Five of the six employees have been dismissed and the sixth was demoted, the bank said. All six were based in the Los Angeles area. The suit filed in state court provides the bank's answer to the question of whether its employees defrauded it or were merely sloppy. ''We simply do not have any basis to believe or suspect fraud or criminal acts by any of our employees,'' said Winslow Christian, director of litigation for the bank.
2/25/1985	NATIONWIDE PATTERN BEING FOUND IN HUGE LOSSES ON BAD MORTGAGES	As they sift through piles of documents, bankers, lawyers and law-enforcement officials are concluding that startling losses by the Bank of America on mortgages reflect a pattern of defaults across the country. And they say that losses from the defaults have stung other California institutions and cheated mortgage investors around the nation. In perhaps half a dozen other recent episodes, financial institutions have lost money in circumstances with all the earmarks of the Bank of America case, investigators say. They say that it is unlikely that a single criminal mastermind has created the problem and that it is more plausible that various shady operators have exploited the same weaknesses in the mortgage markets. But, it is also true that some of the same players crop up as borrowers, lenders or middlemen in apparently disparate circumstances.
2/20/1985	Mortgage Suit Claims Fraud	The National Mortgage Equity Corporation, in a suit filed today in Federal District Court, said it was a victim in the mortgage-related scandal that has cost the Bank of America $95 million. The suit, filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, charged two people with fraudulently diverting millions of dollars to the West Pac Corporation, a company that National Mortgage contends was controlled by the two.
2/15/1985	BANK WAS ASSURED ON MORTGAGES	A major Chicago law firm, Lord, Bissell & Brook, told the Wells Fargo Bank two years ago that charges of problems in some of the mortgage- backed securities that the bank was handling ''were incorrect,'' a spokesman for the bank said today. Those mortgages are part of an apparent fraud scheme that has ensnared the Bank of America and, to a lesser extent, Wells Fargo. The BankAmerica Corporation, parent company of the Bank of America, took a $95 million write-off last quarter for losses related to pools of mortgages for which it served as escrow agent and trustee. Many of the mortgages were originated by the National Mortgage Equity Corporation, a mortgage brokerage concern.
1/29/1985	Bank of America Computer Plan	The Bank of America announced a major program to improve its worldwide computer capabilities. The activities will be organized into a new department with about 5,000 employees.
1/24/1985	Coast Bank Wins Ruling	The Bank of America won a ruling in Superior Court today in a class action lawsuit that charged the bank with breaching its fiduciary duty to its trust beneficiaries by depositing their cash in accounts with no interest or below-market interest rates. The suit, which was filed in 1979 and has been known as the Van de Kamp case for its lead plaintiff, Ted E. Van de Kamp, charged the bank with pooling and using the cash balances in the accounts to its own advantage rather than in the best interest of the benficiaries, and improperly profiting from the float on unpaid disbursement checks from trust accounts.
12/10/1984	McNamara, Clausen and Loans	The Bank of America is among the banks where directors are now engaged in reviewing loans to the third world.
11/29/1984	BANK OF AMERICA AND OTHERS CUT PRIME TO 11 1/4%	The Bank of America and several other major banks cut their prime interest rates to 11 1/4 percent yesterday, following the Chase Manhattan Bank's move, made Tuesday. Analysts said other banks were likely to follow soon. Besides the Bank of America, other big banks that lowered their rates yesterday included the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, First National Bank of Chicago and Chemical Bank.
11/18/1984	THE NATION ; Big Banks ToldTo Tighten Up	Still smarting from criticism that followed the recent $4.5 billion Government bailout of the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company, Federal officials have prescribed an unusual dose of preventive regulation for two of the nation's largest banks. The Comptroller of the Currency ordered the Bank of America and the First National Bank of Chicago to shore up their financial underpinnings and tighten their credit policies, officials at the two banks disclosed last week. Banking industry analysts said that with the move, the Government appeared to be launching a new strategy of stepping in early when a bank showed symptoms of potential weakness. Both banks reported loan losses in the quarter-billion-dollar range for the third quarter.
11/16/1984	U.S. MAKES 2 BANKS VOW TO REINFORCE CREDIT OPERATIONS	The Federal Government, in an unusual move, has forced two of the nation's largest banks to strengthen their credit policies and bolster their financial underpinnings, the banks said yesterday in separate statements. The two banks are the Bank of America, the largest in the United States, and the First National Bank of Chicago, the eighth largest. Directors of both banks have been required by the Comptroller of the Currency, the arm of the Treasury Department that regulates federally chartered banks, to sign formal pledges to make specific changes. If the banks do not comply, the Comptroller can take the signed statements to court to obtain removal of the banks' senior officers.
10/15/1984	Foreign Banks Lose Mexican Debt Case	A Mexican court has ruled that foreign banks must allow Cerveceria Moctezuma, one of Mexico's largest beer companies, to repay its debt over the next three years. The ruling ended, at least temporarily, an attempt by the foreign banks, led by the Bank of America and the Chase Manhattan Bank, to force the immediate repayment of more than $340 million. And it averted what would have been the first bankruptcy in the renegotiation of a number of private sector debts with foreign banks. There was no immediate official reaction from the foreign banking community here, which has consistently refused to comment on the case. However, one frustrated banker, who asked not to be identified, said that ''there's no way that the company can pay in three years in pesos, yen or Monopoly money.''
10/13/1984	Coast Man Holds Four In Bank Before Giving Up	A man scheduled to be sentenced Monday for bank robbery kidnapped a bank manager at her home today, then held her and three other employees hostage at a Bank of America for two and a half hours before releasing them unharmed and surrendering, officers said. Lieut.
6/21/1984	Continental Bank Aid	The seven banks that teamed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in last month's rescue of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company have been joined by eight other banks in the aid package, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company said today. The banks in the original agreement - Morgan, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover, Chase, Chemical, Bankers Trust and Bank of America - will sell a portion of the $500 million of Continental subordinated notes they bought to the eight new banks.
5/16/1984	IT'S POSSIBLE TO MEET AGAIN UNDER THE BILTMORE CLOCK	The story ended yesterday morning where it began nearly three years ago - under the Biltmore clock. Tucked almost out of sight in the 28-story atrium of the new Bank of America Plaza at 335 Madison Avenue, the clock read 11:30 as balloons streamed down from above during the building's dedication ceremony. Such an upbeat finale might have been hard to predict in August 1981, when the rebuilding of the old Biltmore Hotel as an office tower began with the destruction of its most celebrated salon, the Palm Court. The room was demolished over a weekend, taking city officials and private preservationists by surprise.
5/16/1984	NEW BANK OF AMERICA CENTER IN CITY	The Bank of America, long considered an out-of-town cousin when it comes to New York financial dealings, formally opened its new regional headquarters on Madison Avenue yesterday. To do so, it had gutted the Biltmore Hotel and its famous Palm Court. But the San Francisco-based bank retained the legendary Biltmore lobby clock as the centerpiece of the renovated 28-story structure, perhaps hoping to receive the kind of attention that the clock had as the designated New York meeting place for people the world over.
4/24/1984	INTERSTATE BANKING RUSH IS ON	Even though interstate banking is supposed to be prohibited by Federal law, growing numbers of banks and savings institutions, including some of the nation's largest, are scrambling to expand across state lines. Their latest strategy is to take advantage of a loophole in the Federal law. It generally bans branching by banks across state lines but only by institutions that make commercial loans. Therefore, some banking companies have been able to set up so-called non-bank banks, which accept deposits and provide a wide range of other services that often include personal loans but no commercial loans. Just today two more major banks - the Bank of America and the Marine Midland Bank - announced that they would seek approval from Federal regulators to establish deposit- taking and consumer lending operations across state lines.
12/24/1983	Seafirst Debt Case	A Federal judge today ordered Clinton Manges, a south Texas rancher-oilman, to pay about $34 million to a Seattle bank that lost hundreds of millions of dollars in bad energy loans. The ruling by United States District Judge Fred Shannon settled part of a complicated exchange of lawsuits between Mr. Manges and the Seafirst Bank of Seattle.
9/30/1983	DEVELOPER WON'T RECREATE PART OF BILTMORE PALM COURT	The developers of the Manhattan office tower that replaced the Biltmore Hotel said yesterday that, under a new agreement, they would not re-create parts of the hotel's famous Palm Court. Instead, the owners will contribute $500,000 to a special landmarks fund to be administered by a private group that was originally responsible for overseeing the restoration. ''We've agreed to accept a substantial contribution so that we don't get involved in a Biltmore situation again,'' said a spokesman for the nonprofit organization, the New York Landmarks Conservancy, in acknowledging the agreement. As workers began to take apart the hotel in August 1981, the Conservancy tried through court action to stop its demolition until New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission had a chance to determine whether some of the building's features should be designated official landmarks. The unsuccessful court action and other alternatives were limited by a shortage of funds, the spokesman said.
8/29/1983	SOUTH KOREA'S BANKING SHIFTS	Banking, it is said, is the art of gauging risk, deciding whether a client has plans or dreams and then approving or denying a loan. In South Korea this fundamental bankers' art is not highly developed. The reason is that for the last two decades Korean banks have been essentially instruments of Government policy, funneling money into industries marked for rapid expansion. ''Korean banks were public corporations without incentives to innovate and become more efficient,'' said Kim Mahn-je, president of the KorAm Bank. ''But things have changed. From now on, the banks will have to start acting more like banks.''
8/19/1983	BANKS RESCHEDULE DEBT DUE FROM POLAND IN '83	Western bankers and Polish officials agreed today to reschedule $2.6 billion in Polish debts that are due in 1983. Of the $2.6 billion, $1.5 billion represents principal and $1.1 billion represents interest. The money is owed to 500 banks throughout the non-Communist world, and they must ratify the agreement before it takes effect. Bank officials following the talks said they expected ratification by year's end.
10/3/1959	BANK OF AMERICA GETS A NEW HOME; International Unit of West Coast Concern Takes Title to 37-41 Broad Street	The Bank of America (International), a subsidiary of the Bank of America, San Francisco, has taken title to its new home office building at 37-41 Broad Street.
10/2/1957	ITALIAN BANK SALE SET; Bank of America Acquires Transamerica Subsidiary	The Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association is planning to expand its facilities in the foreign field, it was learned yesterday. To that end, the California institution, which operates a state-wide branch banking organization, has formed a new corporation to engage in international banking and financial activities.
7/11/1956	Bank Branch Set for Beirut	The withdrawal of Canadian funds from this market as a result of the break in the securities markets and of money rates will show its effects eventually in some improvement of Canadian exchange, the Bank of America says in its current bulletin.
11/22/1949	BANK OF AMERICA TO EXPAND ABROAD; California Institution Forms a New Corporation for Overseas Activities	State Controller Morris S.

He was held in $2,500 bail for a further hearing tomorrow."

CHATHAM PHENIX ALSO OUT Shares Have Risen From $568 to $684 This Year--Movement is Result of Fear of Manipulation.	Although trading fell away slightly from the recent heavy records, the undertone in the over-the-counter market yesterday was steady. The features continued to be interest in several of the bank stocks and the improved inquiry in the industrial section. Insurance stocks were also stronger.
4/4/1928	$225 FOR NEW SHARES OF BANK OF AMERICA; Non-Transferrable Rights to Go to Bank of Italy and Bancitaly Stockholders.	The Bank of America, which has operated under a New York State charter 116 years and is one of the oldest financial institutions in Wall Street, has called a special meeting of its stockholders for March 26 to take the necessary action looking to the conversion of the bank into a national banking association.
