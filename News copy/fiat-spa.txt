5/4/2006	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Earnings Top Estimates	Fiat reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit as sales of its Grande Punto hatchback helped earnings at its auto unit. Net income fell to 138 million euros ($174 million), better than the 105 million euros expected by analysts. The profit was down from 295 million euros a year earlier, when Fiat had a one-time gain of 715 million euros from a General Motors payment to end a failed alliance. Fiat Auto had earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items of 57 million euros ($72 million) in contrast to a loss of 129 million euros a year earlier.

The company, based in Turin, also posted its first full-year profit since 2000. Net income of 38 million euros ($46 million) contrasted with a loss of 550 million euros ($665 million) a year earlier, Fiat said yesterday. Sales rose 7.5 percent to 13.1 billion euros ($15.8 billion).

Fiat posted its second consecutive profit, again pushed into the black by extraordinary gains. Fiat earned 217 million euros ($263 million) in the second quarter on a 419 million euro ($508 million) gain on the last payout from General Motors to dissolve their partnership. Revenue was unchanged at 12.1 billion euros.
6/24/2005	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat to Cut Costs $604 Million	Fiat plans to reduce automotive costs by 500 million euros ($604 million) this year.

3/1/2005	Fiat Vows That '04 Was Its Last Year for Red Ink	Fiat, the beleaguered Italian car maker, said Monday that its fourth-quarter loss shrank by two-thirds, and the company's chief executive pledged that 2004 would be the last year the company would lose money. Fiat, based here in what was once the heartland of Italian industry, pared its fourth-quarter loss to 374 million euros, or $495 million, from 1.1 billion euros in the final quarter of 2003. Sales were little changed at 12.5 billion euros.
2/14/2005	G.M. Will Pay $2 Billion To Sever Ties to Fiat	General Motors said on Sunday that it would pay Fiat $2 billion so that it would not be forced to take over Fiat's ailing auto business, resolving a dispute between the two that had threatened to become a court battle. The companies also dissolved a five-year-old industrial partnership in which they jointly produced engines and transmissions in Europe and Latin America and jointly purchased parts, though they said they would continue to cooperate in some areas.
2/3/2005	G.M.-Fiat Dispute Unresolved as Talks End	Fiat and General Motors moved another step closer to a courtroom battle Wednesday after talks failed to produce an agreement on the validity of Fiat's option to sell its unprofitable and debt-burdened auto unit to G.M. The formal negotiation period, which began Dec. 16, ended at midnight Tuesday without resolution, Fiat said. Both companies are now free to go to court to resolve the dispute, with the case heard in New York.
1/25/2005	One More Week of Talks In G.M.-Fiat Standoff	General Motors and Fiat will conclude settlement talks over their complex and fractured alliance on Feb. 1, the two companies said Monday. What happens on Feb. 2 remains to be seen. The companies are locked in a standoff over Fiat's struggling automotive business. Under the terms of a broad partnership agreement struck in 2000, Fiat negotiated the right, which went into effect on Monday, to sell its auto business to G.M., with the right lasting through the decade.
12/15/2004	G.M.-Fiat Talks Fail to Resolve Rift Over Partnership Agreement	The high-stakes standoff between General Motors and Fiat over the terms of a 2000 partnership moved a step closer to the courtroom on Tuesday.

12/10/2004	Fiat Vows to Defend Its Right to Sell Car Unit to G.M.	Sergio Marchionne, the new chief executive of the Fiat Group, said Thursday that his company would vigorously defend its right to sell its auto business to General Motors, a move G.M. has said it will contest in court if need be. Fiat won that right as part of a broad partnership with G.M. in 2000. But with Fiat's auto business saddled with roughly $10 billion in debt, and with G.M. itself struggling, the prospect of a sale is of increasing concern to G.M.'s management and Wall Street.
10/29/2004	Fiat Is Still Losing Money, but Less of It	The Italian industrial conglomerate Fiat said on Thursday that it had sharply narrowed its operating loss in the third quarter, taking one more step on its slow march toward profitability. Fiat, which has not had a full-year operating profit since 2001, lost 97 million euros, or $122 million, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of 303 million euros in the same period last year. Sales at Fiat, a maker of cars, tractors, trucks and automotive components, rose 9.4 percent in the quarter to 10.6 billion euros ($12.7 billion).
10/20/2004	More Brazilian Drivers Turn to Ethanol	When Brazil's state-owned oil company announced this month that it was raising gasoline prices to keep up with the rising cost of crude oil, Gutemberg do Brasil Moreira barely blinked. Mr. Moreira is an oral surgeon who spends a good portion of his days battling traffic going to hospitals all over this sprawling metropolis. He drives a car that runs on either gasoline or ethanol, or any combination of the two. But with ethanol -- or alcohol, as most Brazilians call it -- selling at half the price of gasoline at the pump, Mr. Moreira does not waste any time deciding which fuel to use when filling up his three-month-old Volkswagen Fox.
9/2/2004	24 Executives Named to Help Revamp Fiat Auto Unit	Fiat named 24 executives to its money-losing auto division Wednesday in an attempt to streamline decision making, cut costs and nurse the car unit back to profitability. The new managers will report directly to Herbert Demel, who was named chief of the auto unit last year. By concentrating power in the hands of Mr. Demel, an Austrian with two decades of experience in the auto business, Fiat will be eliminating a layer of management in an attempt to speed decision making. The streamlining is being accomplished by job transfers and early retirement.
7/27/2004	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Another Loss At Fiat	The country's largest manufacturer, Fiat, reported an 11th consecutive quarterly loss because of reorganization costs and a strike at its Melfi car plant. The company reiterated its 2004 goal of breaking even at the operating level, forecasting stronger sales in the second half. The second-quarter net loss widened to 464 million euros ($562 million), from 27 million euros, or 4 cents, a year earlier. Second-quarter sales fell to 12.3 billion euros from 12.5 billion euros. The chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, above, said he expected a loss next year for the company and at Fiat Auto. Fiat Auto reported an operating loss of 282 million euros, compared with a loss of 234 million euros, a year earlier.
7/20/2004	New Chairman of Fiat Takes Added Challenge	For the last 5 of his 13 years as head of Ferrari, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo has savored the heady success of seeing his cars and drivers take trophies on the Formula One circuit. Now, though, he faces different and some would say much more perilous contests altogether, taking on two jobs that make him yet more prominent in Italian life than running Ferrari, a company that combines the status of a national icon with a rare story of business success.
6/2/2004	Fiat Names Director as Chief And Vows to Remain in Autos	Just days after the death of Fiat's chairman raised questions on the direction of the company, Fiat named a chief executive on Tuesday, reaffirmed its commitment to its money-losing car unit and said that it would accelerate a restructuring plan that aims for a return to profit in 2006. The board of Fiat named Sergio Marchionne, until Tuesday morning the chief executive of the Swiss quality and testing services company SGS, to be chief executive.
6/1/2004	Member of the Fiat Board Is Expected To Take Over as the Chief Executive	Fiat, the ailing giant of the Italian auto industry, is likely to name Sergio Marchionne, an independent member of its board, as chief executive after a series of dramatic weekend maneuvers provoked by the death of its chairman, Umberto Agnelli, according to an executive close to the company. The company plans to confirm Mr. Marchionne's appointment at a board meeting at its Turin headquarters on Tuesday, said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A company spokesman declined to comment on the appointment.
5/31/2004	Chief Resigns Shortly After Fiat Chairman Is Chosen	In a surprise move, Giuseppe Morchio resigned Sunday as chief executive of Fiat, the Italian automaker, two days after the death of the company's chairman, Umberto Agnelli. The announcement of Mr. Morchio's resignation came about an hour after Fiat said that Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, chairman of Ferrari, would be appointed to replace Mr. Agnelli as Fiat's chairman. Ferrari is majority owned by Fiat. Mr. Montezemolo, 56, is close to the Agnelli family, which owns 30 percent of Fiat and is its largest shareholder.
5/12/2004	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Loss Narrows	Italy's largest manufacturer, Fiat, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of narrowing losses, helped by the sale of assets and demand for new models. The first-quarter loss narrowed to 194 million euros ($230 million) from 681 million euros a year earlier, the company said. Sales fell to 11.2 billion euros from 12.3 billion euros because of the disposal of units including FiatAvio.
4/30/2004	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Blockade Ends	Workers at Fiat ended their 10-day blockade of the company's car factory in the southern Italian town of Melfi, allowing workers who were not on strike to return to work. Union representatives and the car company's management met to search for an agreement that would lead to an end to the strike. Production at Fiat's other five Italian car factories, which has halted because the Melfi plant makes auto parts used in the other factories, will begin early next week, a company spokesman said. Lost production as a result of the strike so far totals almost 30,000 cars. Eric Sylvers (NYT)
4/29/2004	Strike at Plant In Day 10; Fiat Shuts Five Others	A strike by Fiat workers in the southern Italian town of Melfi entered its 10th day on Wednesday, posing a threat to Fiat's nascent recovery from its worst financial predicament. Though only one of Fiat's plants is on strike, a lack of the parts made there has halted production at five other Fiat car factories in Italy. Lost production as a result of the strike so far totals 25,000 cars.
2/28/2004	Fiat Reports Improved Results, but It Is Still Losing Money	The Italian industrial group Fiat, which lost almost 4 billion euros in 2002, said on Friday that it had narrowed its fourth-quarter loss, advancing on the path to recovery. The net loss in the fourth quarter dropped by almost two-thirds, to 1.1 billion euros ($1.37 billion) compared with 2.97 billion euros in the period in 2002. For the full year, the loss was 1.9 billion euros, down from 3.9 billion euros in 2002.
10/27/2003	G.M. and Fiat Delay Deal	The General Motors Corporation and Fiat S.p.A. said yesterday that they had delayed by a year an accord that could have forced General Motors to buy Fiat's unprofitable automotive unit in January because of a dispute over the accord's validity. They will postpone the agreement until Jan. 24, 2005, and put off any legal action related to their differences until Dec. 15, 2004, they said in a joint statement.
10/9/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Names Executive	The Italian industrial company Fiat said it named Herbert Demel, a former Volkswagen executive, as head of its carmaking unit, succeeding Giancarlo Boschetti, who is scheduled to retire next year. Mr. Demel, 49, ran Volkswagen's unit in Brazil and its Audi luxury-car business before leaving the company in August 2002 to become chief executive of Magna Steyr, the Austrian unit of the Canadian auto-parts maker Magna International Inc.
10/3/2003	Fiat Is Said to Consider Austrian to Head Its Auto Unit	The Fiat Group of Italy is considering choosing Herbert Demel, an Austrian executive who once ran the Brazilian unit of Volkswagen, to replace the chief executive of its struggling auto unit, according to a person close to the deliberations. The choice of Mr. Demel, 49, who is now chief executive of Magna Steyr, an Austrian producer of cars for automakers like DaimlerChrysler and BMW, was first reported on Thursday on the Web site of Automotive News Europe, a trade journal, citing an official close to the hiring process. Fiat officials were unavailable for comment Thursday evening.
8/1/2003	Auto Unit Overhaul Cited as Fiat Cuts Losses	As efforts to increase efficiency at its troubled auto division appeared to take hold, the Fiat group today reported better-than-expected results in the second quarter for its global activities. Results at the auto division were largely in line with investor expectations. Considerable challenges, however, loom for Fiat this year, including pessimism about the European auto sales outlook, an expected glut of new models from strong competitors, like Volkswagen, and the future of Fiat's alliance with General Motors, which owns 20 percent of Fiat Auto. While Fiat has a five-year option to sell the remaining 80 percent to General Motors beginning in January, General Motors has been unwilling to pour more money into Fiat.
7/14/2003	Europe Is Examining Utility Issues in Italy	The European Commission may open an inquiry into the Italian holdings of ?lectricit de France, the French government-owned power company, after limits are lifted on the company's voting rights in an Italian utility, the European Union competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said on Saturday. The European Commission wants Italy to drop restrictions it imposed on ?lectricit de France's ownership of an energy company it controls with a partner, Fiat SpA, Italy's largest manufacturer, Mr. Monti said. Mr. Monti also wants France to open its domestic energy market to competition, he said.
7/4/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Sales Fall	Italy's largest manufacturer, Fiat, lost ground to its competitors in the Italian car market last month. Sales of Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo brand cars dropped 4.6 percent, to 48,510 units from 50,833 in June 2002, the Transport Ministry said. Fiat's share of the market fell to 27 percent from 28.2 percent a year earlier. Fiat is introducing new models this year to try and win back customers. They include a new version of the Punto, a new Lancia Ypsilon, above, unveiled last month in Rome, a small car called the Gingo, a minivan and an Alfa Romeo GT Coupe.
7/3/2003	Fiat Will Sell Aerospace Division for $1.7 Billion	The Italian conglomerate Fiat took another step today in its efforts to turn itself around and return to profitability when it agreed to sell its aerospace components business, FiatAvio, for about 1.5 billion euros, or $1.73 billion. Finmeccanica, Italy's government-controlled defense company, and the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm in the United States, will make the purchase through a specially created acquisition company, Avio Holding. Finmeccanica will own 30 percent of Avio Holding and Carlyle will own the rest.
6/27/2003	Fiat to Eliminate Jobs and Close Plants	In what has been called its last chance to turn around its car business and save itself from ruin, Fiat today announced a four-year plan that includes 12,300 layoffs, a 1.84-billion-euro capital increase and a return to profit in 2006. Fiat, which lost 3.9 billion euros last year and recently had its debt rating cut to junk status by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, will fire 2,800 people in Italy and 9,500 abroad. Fiat said that while recent asset sales, the capital increase and cost cuts would provide enough cash to finance the plan, a sale of new bonds would be considered if the terms were favorable.
6/8/2003	Europeans Dream of the U.S. Again	EUROPEAN automakers that abandoned the United States over the last two decades are standing on the outside looking in wistfully at the success of competitors, like BMW and Mercedes, that stayed put. And some of these exiles are either laying plans or considering strategies to return to American showrooms. Among those with thoughts of returning, even if far in the future, are Alfa Romeo and Fiat of Italy; Citro?n, Renault and Peugeot of France; and MG Rover of Britain. The companies appear undeterred by the lack of a clamor among Americans seeking to buy more French and Italian cars.
5/17/2003	Fiat Rating Cut Possible	Fiat may have its credit rating cut for the third time in less than 12 months as Moody's Investors Service reviews the company for a possible downgrading after Fiat posted a sixth straight quarterly loss. The review will affect about 12.7 billion euros ($14.7 billion) worth of debt, Moody's said yesterday. Moody's rating on long-term debt at Fiat's finance units is currently Ba1, a noninvestment grade.
5/16/2003	A Tale of 2 Carmakers and 2 Countries	To the casual observer, the sprawling BMW car plant outside this quaint university town appears to be much like the main plant of the Fiat group outside Turin, Italy. At each factory, shiny new cars roll leisurely along assembly lines dominated by giant twisting robots and automated welders that spray sparks like New Year's fireworks. But the similarity ends there. The deeper contrasts between the two factories capture in microcosm the heady revival of British carmaking under foreign ownership, and the crisis facing Fiat, which has no foreign-owned rivals in its home market.
5/14/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Loss Grows	Italy's largest industrial company and its No. 1 carmaker, Fiat, reported a larger first-quarter loss and said the rest of 2003 would be ''difficult and challenging.'' The company lost 681 million euros ($787 million) in the first three months of the year compared with a loss of 529 million euros in the same quarter of 2002. Revenue fell 15 percent, to 12.3 billion euros ($14.2 billion). Fiat's car unit posted a drop in sales and an operating loss of 334 million euros. The company predicted that its 2003 operating loss will be less than what it lost last year. Eric Sylvers (NYT)
5/7/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Gains Market Share	Fiat sold fewer vehicles in Italy in April than in April of last year, but an industry group said the company's market share increased as total new car sales fell 5.8 percent. Fiat sold 52,660 vehicles in Italy last month, 28.8 percent of the market, compared with 28 percent in March. Fiat's market share was 31 percent in April 2002. Fiat has been selling assets to increase investments in its money-losing car division. Eric Sylvers (NYT)
4/8/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Sells Unit	Fiat, raising cash to rescue its troubled auto division, agreed to enter exclusive talks to sell its profitable aerospace unit, FiatAvio, for 1.6 billion euros ($1.7 billion) to a combination of the Carlyle Group of Washington and the Italian state-owned conglomerate Finmeccanica, the country's biggest military contractor. Last month, Fiat sold its Toro insurance business for 2.4 billion euros as part of a drive to raise 5 billion euros for the unprofitable Fiat Auto. FiatAvio, which posted operating income last year of 210 million euros on revenue of 1.5 billion euros, makes components for military and civilian aircraft and for the European Ariane space rocket. The French state-owned maker of engines for aircraft and rockets, Snecma, was also interested in FiatAvio. John Tagliabue (NYT)
4/2/2003	World Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat For Finance Minister	Bowing to political pressure to support Italy's struggling Fiat car maker, Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti retired his German BMW and slid behind the wheel of a hometown Lancia. Once the icon of Italian industry, Fiat began laying off thousands of workers in December.
4/2/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Possible Bid For Fiat Unit	Italy's state-controlled defense company, Finmeccanica, said it might team with the Carlyle Group of the United States in a joint bid to buy Fiat's aeronautics unit FiatAvio. Analysts have said FiatAvio could sell for as much as 2 billion euros. Fiat, which agreed a week ago to sell its insurance unit, is raising funds that will be invested in the company's money-losing car business. Finmeccanica's chairman, Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, said the Italian company could finance its portion of the acquisition without having to sell its most valuable asset, an 18 percent stake in the semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics. Eric Sylvers (NYT)
3/23/2003	Fiat to Sell Insurance Unit to Publishing Group for $2.5 Billion	In an effort to raise cash and reduce debt, Fiat has agreed to sell its insurance unit, Toro Assicurazioni, to the De Agostini publishing group of Italy for 2.4 billion euros, or $2.5 billion, Fiat said today. For Fiat, the sale of Toro, Italy's third largest insurer, represents a capital gain of roughly $370 million and will help cut Fiat's net debt by about $1.5 billion, Fiat said in a statement released after a meeting of its board of directors in Turin, where Fiat is based.
3/6/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Rating Downgraded	Standard & Poor's cut Fiat's credit rating to junk and said the company, Italy's largest private-sector employer, is unlikely to get an investment-grade ranking in the foreseeable future. S.& P. cited, among other things, Fiat's plans to sell two profitable units and focus investments on its money-losing car making business. The decision comes the day after Fitch lowered its rating on Fiat to junk. Moody's Investors Service placed Fiat, which has almost 30 billion euros in outstanding debt, below investment grade last year. Eric Sylvers (NYT)
3/1/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Loss At Fiat	Italy's biggest manufacturer, Fiat, will invest as much as 5 billion euros ($5.38 billion) to rescue its auto business after reporting a record fourth-quarter loss on write-downs of assets and reorganization costs. The company, which is based in Turin, lost 2.9 billion euros compared with a loss of 988 million euros a year earlier. Fiat said it had spent more than a billion euros last year on reorganizing the car business, which lost 180 million euros in the quarter, down from a loss of 432 million euros. Fiat said it would give its auto unit an intercompany loan of 3 billion euros immediately and 2 billion euros more over the next 18 months.
2/26/2003	Fiat Chairman Leaving to Make Way for Agnelli	Fiat's chairman, Paolo Fresco, said today that he would step down on Friday, several months earlier than planned, to make way for Umberto Agnelli to take over. Mr. Agnelli, 68, runs two family investment companies through which Fiat, Italy's largest manufacturer, is controlled. He is the brother of Giovanni Agnelli, the family patriarch who died last month of cancer. While Mr. Agnelli is viewed as less committed than his brother was to holding on to Fiat's money-losing car unit, he inherits a dedication to the company's core business. The two brothers are grandsons of Giovanni Agnelli, who founded Fiat in 1899.
2/18/2003	Fiat Said to Seek Sale of Some Units to Aid Car Division	In a quest to raise cash to shore up its money-losing car unit, Fiat is planning to sell its insurance and aerospace-components businesses, bankers close to Fiat said today. Analysts put the likely proceeds of the sales at more than 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion).
1/25/2003	Agnelli's Brother to Steer Fiat and Holdings	The direction of the embattled Fiat conglomerate took an abrupt turn today with the death of the company's patriarch, Giovanni Agnelli, potentially opening the door to faster and more sweeping change at the company, especially for its floundering auto business. Mr. Agnelli's death came just a few hours before members of the Agnelli family, which founded Fiat and still controls it, were scheduled to gather here to review the results of the family holding company last year.
1/25/2003	Italians Mourn the Man Who 'Created Work' and 'Gave Us Jobs'	Domenica Zaccuri came here in 1963 to what was then a booming industrial town, a young and hopeful bride in search of a future. Today, she stood at Gate 4 of the huge Fiat factory at Mirafiore, outside town, weeping for the man who gave it to them. ''He created work; he gave us jobs,'' she said, wiping back tears. The city mourned, in freezing temperatures under a clear blue sky that appeared to mock the somber mood. With it, all Italy mourned the passing of Giovanni Agnelli, known universally as Gianni, or L'Avvocato, the defender, the 81-year old patriarch of the family that was the Italian republic's closest thing to aristocracy.
1/21/2003	Fiat Chairman Talks of a Spinoff of Money-Losing Auto Unit	The chairman of Fiat, Paolo Fresco, said today that the company was considering plans to split off its money-losing automobile division and raise the fresh cash needed to restore it to profitability. Mr. Fresco said the goal of the spinoff would be to ''recapitalize our core businesses, starting with Fiat Auto, but not only Fiat Auto.'' He did not elaborate.
1/15/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Money Promised For Fiat	The Agnelli family is willing to invest more money in Fiat to help rescue the company, Italy's largest manufacturer, said Umberto Agnelli, whose family owns 30 percent of Fiat. ''Our commitment to provide the company with the funds it needs isn't in doubt,'' said Mr. Agnelli, grandson of the company's founder, in a newspaper interview with MF. A spokesman for Ifil, one of the holding companies through which the family controls Fiat, confirmed the remarks.
1/8/2003	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Lags Rivals	The Italian carmaker Fiat said that its sales in Italy rose 23.3 percent in December, its only monthly sales increase in 2002, but it still lagged foreign competitors. An end-of-the-year deadline for Italian car buyers to qualify for government rebates contributed to Fiat's sales increase but seemed to help its rivals even more, as sales for all carmakers rose 51.4 percent. Fiat's Italian sales fell 17.8 percent in 2002 and the auto division is expected to post an operating loss of about 1.2 billion euros ($1.2 billion) for the year. Jason Horowitz (NYT)
1/4/2003	Fiat's Woes, Europe's Disunion	They must be breathing a sigh of relief in Detroit. Roberto Colaninno, the entrepreneurial turnaround artist, now seems set to play the role of white knight in Fiat's tale of woe. He may buy a controlling interest and relieve General Motors of its potential obligation to acquire the 80 percent stake in the iconic but troubled Italian automaker that it doesn't already own. The fact that G.M. now has little interest in owning Fiat is what makes this deal -- if it goes through -- good news. But it will be a happy ending to a bad scenario. This was a plan orchestrated in part by the Italian government, which encouraged Mr. Colaninno to get involved because Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was driven by a misplaced sense of economic nationalism to make sure Fiat remained in Italian hands.
1/3/2003	Talk of a Rescue Bid Buoys Fiat's Shares	Shares of Fiat surged today as investors anticipated that Roberto Colaninno, the Italian entrepreneur, would make a bid to rescue the company with an injection of fresh money. Mr. Colaninno is considering a plan to inject as much as $8 billion into Fiat, which is crippled by heavy debt and losses at its auto division.
1/1/2003	Entrepreneur Said to Offer To Rescue Fiat With $8 Billion	Roberto Colaninno, the Italian entrepreneur who engineered the hostile takeover of Telecom Italia four years ago, has proposed to Fiat's creditor banks an ambitious $8 billion plan to rescue the Fiat group, people involved in developing the plan said today. While the proposal is still only in its broad outlines, it calls for a group of investors led by Mr. Colaninno to put $2.5 billion to $3 billion into Fiat, with the company raising an additional $4 billion through divestitures. The plan also envisions a swap with General Motors, which owns 20 percent of the Fiat auto division, under which G. M. would be released from a requirement that it acquire the 80 percent it does not own, in exchange for G.M.'s joining a capital increase at Fiat Auto.
12/31/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: A Plea For Fiat Funds	Italy's billionaire Agnelli family should use some of its own money to rescue the car business of Fiat, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said amid calls for the government to do so. ''I hope the Agnellis can invest more money and pull through Fiat Auto, even if it means selling other assets,'' Mr. Berlusconi said at his year-end news conference in Rome. ''I think the Agnellis owe this to the country.'' Fiat, Italy's biggest manufacturer, is controlled by the Agnelli family. It is eliminating 8,100 jobs and cutting production to reduce losses at the auto unit.
12/28/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Downgrade Hurts Shares	Fiat shares fell to their lowest price in almost 18 years after the company lost its investment-grade credit rating. Moody's Investors Service cut its rating on about half of Fiat's 33 billion euros ($34 billion) in debt on Monday, citing concern about the company's unprofitable auto unit. Fiat's Italian car sales have fallen every month this year. The automaker sold its 5 percent stake in General Motors last week for $1.2 billion and agreed to sell 51 percent of Fidis, its consumer finance unit, to Italy's top four banks, for 400 million euros. The shares fell 40 cents, to 7.70 euros, the lowest price since 1985.
12/24/2002	Moody's Cuts Its Ratings On Fiat Debt To Junk Level	Moody's Investors Service cut its ratings today on roughly $15 billion of Fiat debt to ''junk'' status, despite Fiat's recent sales of assets worth more than $1.6 billion. The credit downgrade comes at a time when Fiat has begun a broad overhaul to stanch losses at its struggling auto unit and to reduce its mountain of debt. Moody's said that its move was in response to Fiat's operating performance, particularly at the battered automobile division, its high debt levels, and the likelihood that Fiat, even after shedding its car business, would still not merit an investor grade rating.
12/14/2002	Chairman of Fiat Wins Fight To Hold Control of Company	Ending a bitter weeklong struggle for control of Fiat, the company's board retained Paolo Fresco as chairman and joint chief executive today and promoted the chief operating officer, Alessandro Barberis, to join him in the chief executive's job. Mr. Barberis, 65, ran the Piaggio motor scooter company, which is also controlled by the Agnelli family of Fiat, before joining Fiat in June. He succeeds Gabriele Galateri di Genola, who announced his resignation on Tuesday.
12/12/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Questions For Fiat	The Italian stock market regulator, Consob, asked the ailing Italian conglomerate Fiat to report whether it had replaced plans to overhaul its unprofitable auto unit with other proposals. Consob, apparently reacting to news reports in Italy and elsewhere, asked whether Mediobanca, the Milan investment bank, or the resignation on Tuesday of Fiat's joint chief executive, Gabriele Galateri di Genola, had anything to do with any change in plans. Fiat, in a statement that did not mention the requests by Consob, said its board would meet tomorrow to discuss changes to the board's makeup and the convening of an extraordinary shareholder meeting. John Tagliabue (NYT)
12/11/2002	Co-Chief Resigns at Fiat as the Shake-Up Continues	The joint chief executive of Fiat, the battered Italian conglomerate, said today that he would resign. The resignation of the executive, Gabriele Galateri di Genola, is the latest in a series of management shake-ups at Fiat in the last year, as the company begins a broad reorganization to stanch $2 billion in losses this year at its struggling auto unit.
12/7/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Protests Over Fiat Cuts	Italy's biggest manufacturer, Fiat, faced strikes at plants across the country after the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi approved the carmaker's plan to start laying off workers on Monday. More than 5,000 striking employees curtailed production at Fiat's Mirafiori factory near its headquarters in Turin and protesters occupied the train station in the city. Fiat, facing its worse crisis in a decade, is cutting jobs and production to save a billion euros ($999 million) and stem losses at the auto unit.
12/6/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Job Cuts Approved For Fiat	Fiat, Italy's largest manufacturer, received government approval to cut as many as 8,100 jobs as it seeks to stem losses at its carmaking unit. Unions protested the proposal, signaling that there will be more of the strikes that have roiled Fiat and Italy since the company announced the reductions in October. The government said it would permit Fiat to lay off 2,400 workers permanently.
12/6/2002	World Briefing | Europe: Italy: Never Underestimate The Power, Etc.	The angry wives of dozens of Fiat workers gathered in front of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's offices in Rome to protest what they said was the government's inability to stop the ailing auto company from laying off thousands of workers. Many came from as far as Sicily to defend their husbands' jobs. Protests have spread around the country since Fiat announced a cost-cutting plan in October to lay off 8,100 workers. Fiat is Italy's largest private employer. Jason Horowitz (NYT)
12/5/2002	World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Auto Finance Unit Sold	Banco Itau, Brazil's second-largest private bank, said that it had bought Banco Fiat, the auto- financing unit of the troubled Italian car maker Fiat Auto for nearly $250 million. Banco Fiat, Brazil's largest financial unit linked to an auto manufacturer, finances about 40 percent of all Fiat sales in Brazil. The deal was the latest in a series of purchases by Banco Itau, which wants to close the gap on its rival, Bradesco, currently Brazil's largest private bank. Although Fiat is struggling in its home market, it has been the market leader in Brazil for two consecutive years. Tony Smith (NYT)
10/17/2002	For Ford and G.M., the Problems Ahead Have Different Sources	While the stocks of General Motors and Ford Motor are falling almost in tandem, the risks seen in the two American automakers are divergent. For Ford, there is worry about its auto business; for G.M., there is worry about much besides its auto business. Today, Ford reported a $326 million loss for the third quarter and the long-term ratings of both Ford and its financial subsidiary, Ford Credit, were put on a credit watch with negative implications by Standard & Poor's. The bond market has taken a dim view of Ford's prospects and the action by the S.& P., a crucial rating agency, only served to drive the company's borrowing costs up further. Wall Street is concerned about the progress that Ford executives are making in cutting costs from bloated manufacturing operations while also bolstering a product lineup that has been losing market share.
10/12/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Weighs Options With G.M.	The ailing Italian automobile giant Fiat played down reports that it was planning to sell the remainder of its auto division to its partner General Motors, while factory workers across the country went on strike against Fiat's proposal to cut 20 percent of its 36,000 work force in Italy. A Fiat spokesman, Raffaelo Porro, said that comments made yesterday by Fiat's chairman, Paolo Fresco, above, indicating the high likelihood of the sale reflected only one extreme option. ''Many options are being studied,'' Mr. Porro said. Jason Horowitz (NYT)
10/10/2002	Fiat Wants to Cut 20% of Italian Work Force	Fiat, struggling with slumping auto sales and a sinking stock price, said today that it would eliminate as many as 8,100 jobs, or more than a fifth of its Italian work force, an unusually large downsizing in Italy. Fiat, Italy's largest private employer, said in a statement that it would ask the government for a ''declaration of corporate crisis'' at Fiat Auto, which would enable workers who are laid off to receive 80 percent of their salary for more than a year from the state welfare fund.
10/4/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Sales Fall	Fiat's car sales in Italy fell for a ninth month in September as the company, the country's largest manufacturer, failed to attract buyers with price cuts and no-interest financing for models like the compact Stilo. Sales of the company's Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia cars slipped 7.5 percent in September. Car sales for all manufacturers in the month rose 3.4 percent, the first gain this year. Fiat's market share fell to a record low of 28.7 percent in September from 32.1 percent a year earlier, the transport ministry said.
8/3/2002	FIAT TO SELL ALUMINUM ENGINE PARTS UNIT TO BUYOUT GROUP	Fiat, Italy's biggest manufacturer, agreed to sell its aluminum engine parts business to a J. P. Morgan Chase & Company acquisition partnership and a United States buyout group for about 460 million euros ($454 million) to reduce debt. J. P. Morgan Partners, Questor Partners and Private Equity Partners will buy the Teksid Aluminum unit of Fiat. The sale will lower Fiat's net debt by 290 million euros, the company said. Fiat is selling 11 subsidiaries to cut the carmaker's debt to 3.6 billion euros, from 6.6 billion euros.
7/30/2002	Fiat Reports Loss and Sees No Profit for Year	With its money-losing automotive unit continuing to drag down other profitable operations, Fiat reported today a loss for the second-quarter and said that it did not expect to earn any money this year. Sales slumped 7.6 percent, to 14.6 billion euros ($14.4 billion), as demand for Fiat's cars, including the Lancia and Alfa Romeo brands, shrank. Fiat Auto lost 394 million euros in the period, offsetting profits at almost every other division except for insurance. Over all, Fiat reported an operating loss of 127 million euros ($125 million), compared with a profit of 403 million euros in the quarter a year earlier.
7/16/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: A Mission For Fiat	Fiat is on a ''holy mission'' to fix its unprofitable car unit and is unlikely to sell it all to General Motors, said Robert Lutz, left, G.M.'s vice chairman. Fiat, Italy's largest manufacturer, sold 20 percent of its auto business, made up of the Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia brands, to G.M. in 2000 for $2.4 billion in stock. Fiat can force G.M. to buy the rest from 2004 to 2009. ''They want to remain autonomous and frankly, I hope they do, although I must confess I would love to see Alfa in the family,'' Mr. Lutz said in an interview.
7/7/2002	Intrigue at the Palazzo Agnelli	AS Gianni Agnelli, the patriarch of Italian industry and dynastic head of the Fiat auto and industrial empire, lay in a New York hospital bed in May and early June, even some of his best friends had sadly given up hope that he would survive prostate cancer. But when a rumor of the death of the 81-year-old Mr. Agnelli swept Italian markets, Fiat's ailing stock leapt by 6 percent. Some investors hoped that the departure of a man whom Italians call ''l'Avvocato'' -- the lawyer -- would hasten the sale of the chronically money-losing auto division that has powered the intertwined destinies of Fiat and the Agnelli family since the company was founded in 1899.
7/2/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Bank Buys Ferrari Stake	Commerzbank has agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the Ferrari division of Fiat for $223 million, a bank spokesman said. The share purchase is part of a deal last week between Fiat and Mediobanca, in which the Italian bank bought 34 percent of Ferarri while agreeing to sell 12.5 percent to other banks. A Commerzbank spokesman, Dieter Schuetz, said the bank intended to hold the stake as an investment. Fiat sold shares in Ferrari to reduce its debt.
6/28/2002	Fiat Names Associate Of Founders As Co-Chief	Fiat, Italy's troubled industrial and automotive giant, named Gabriele Galateri di Genola e Suniglia, a veteran manager and close associate of the company's founding family, to be its co-chief executive today. The move fueled speculation that the company is preparing to exit the auto industry, its main business since 1899. The news came just 17 days after Paolo Cantarella, 57, resigned as chief executive. A company spokesman, Gualberto Ranieri, said the unusually rapid replacement reflected ''a time when you need quick and radical decisions.''
6/27/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Debt Rating Cut	The credit rating of Fiat was cut by Moody's Investors Service to one level above junk because of concern that its carmaking unit would not become profitable for two years. The yield on Fiat's 1.3 billion euros ($1.27 billion) of 6.75 percent bonds that mature in 2011 rose by about one-third of a percentage point to 8.18 percent after the downgrade, said Steven Zhu, an analyst at ABN Amro in London. The outlook for Fiat's debt is ''negative,'' the credit-rating agency said. A cut to junk status would make it more expensive for Fiat to borrow.
6/19/2002	The Agnellis Still Make Fiats, Don't They?	There has been much speculation lately that the Agnelli family of Italy is planning to get out of the automobile business. What has gotten little notice is that it has already begun. In the past, Fiat was the Agnelli fief. But the family's holdings have dipped to 30 percent, from 70 percent right after World War II. At the same time, the Agnellis increased their investments outside Fiat and Italy, notably in France and the United States. A decade ago, Fiat represented 80 percent of the Agnellis' investments; today, the figure is less than half, and Fiat Auto, less than one-quarter.
6/12/2002	Fiat Reluctantly Wonders if It Has to Make Cars	Paolo Fresco likes being No. 1 or No. 2. To explain why, he quotes, as he often does, his former boss John F. Welch Jr. ''If you're No. 1 or No. 2,'' Mr. Fresco said today, picking at fish in a Fiat corporate dining room, ''when you get a cold, No. 5 and No. 6 get pneumonia.''
6/11/2002	Chief Executive of Fiat Resigns in Streamlining	The chief executive of the struggling Fiat group, Paolo Cantarella, said today that he would resign. Fiat said the departure of Mr. Cantarella, 57, would streamline the central management of the company. His duties will be assumed by the company's chairman, Paolo Fresco, who is 68. The move was not entirely unexpected. In December, the chief executive of the company's embattled auto division resigned and there had been reports that pressure was on Mr. Cantarella to do likewise.
6/5/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Chairman Returns	Fiat's honorary chairman, Gianni Agnelli, left, returned to Italy yesterday after having medical treatment in the United States for a prostate condition. His return raised speculation that Fiat would sell 80 percent of its car unit to General Motors. Mr. Agnelli, whose grandfather founded the company in 1899, is seen as the leading opponent of such a sale; the Agnelli family controls 34 percent of Fiat, which has debt of 6.6 billion euros ($6.21 billion). At a news conference, the chief executive, Giancarlo Boschetti, denied rumors that the company had been contacted by General Motors and predicted that Fiat would break even in 2003. Kerry Shaw (NYT)
5/29/2002	Fiat Reaches Agreement With Banks On Its Debt	Fiat and its major creditor banks reached agreement tonight on a major financial plan for the struggling company, refinancing short-term debt totaling 3 billion euros ($2.8 billion). Fiat has been trying to sell assets and reorganize its industrial activities to keep its credit rating from deteriorating. The company is caught in a squeeze: its cash flow has been insufficient to make payments on its sizable debt, obliging it to borrow even more.
5/28/2002	Fiat and Banks Move Closer To a Financing Agreement	Fiat appeared to be inching toward an accord with its major creditor banks tonight on an injection of fresh capital as part of a plan to curb its losses and reduce debt. The agreement is expected to come in exchange for concessions from Fiat, according to people familiar with the negotiations, including shares for the banks in Fiat's Ferrari sports car unit. Fiat intends to have an initial sale of Ferrari shares before the end of the year. But the accord is not expected to include a requirement that Fiat divest itself of its troubled car-making unit, Fiat Auto.
5/15/2002	Fiat Reports Loss and Will Sell Shares in Ferrari Unit	Fiat said today that its struggling automobile division dragged it into a second consecutive quarterly loss and that it would sell shares in its Ferrari sports car unit to reduce debt. The developments appeared to nudge Fiat closer to a decision about what to do over the long term with its troubled carmaking business. Fiat's poor performance, its slowness in bringing models to market and its errors in marketing them, stand in sharp contrast to the success of European competitors like Peugeot of France, which have gained market share at Fiat's expense.
5/7/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Sales Decline	Fiat's Italian auto sales fell 21.7 percent in April compared with a year ago, in the fourth consecutive month of declining sales for the company, the Transport Ministry said. The loss was attributed partly to declining overall car sales in Italy; car registrations there shrunk from 87,333 in April 2001 to 61,340. Fiat recently introduced a midsize car, the Stilo, which has performed below expectations. Fiat had a 2001 loss of 445 million euros ($408 million), its first in eight years, as Fiat Auto lost market share to rivals. Kerry Shaw (NYT)
2/7/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat's Shares Fall	Shares of Fiat S.p.A. fell to a five-month low after a newspaper said Italy's central bank told lenders to curtail loans to the company, the country's biggest manufacturer. The Bank of Italy told Sanpaolo IMI and Banca di Roma, the country's third- and fourth-largest banks, to pull out of lending to Fiat's Edipower unit because the two lenders would be exposed to too much risk if they increased loans to Fiat, an Italian newspaper, MF, reported. Investors are concerned that Fiat is accumulating debt without turning around its car business.
2/6/2002	Will Autos Be a Part Of the Future For Fiat?	First it began diversifying, scaling back the car division's share of total revenue. Then, losses year after year made it clear that the auto division was the sick man in the portfolio. Now the big question about Fiat, the Italian conglomerate, is whether it has an independent future making cars. Such speculation got a boost from news reports that members of the Agnelli family, Fiat's principal shareholders, were complaining that losses at the car division were draining resources from more lucrative investments. All this highlights how Fiat's world is changing and its role in Italian industry is evolving.
12/25/2001	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Welch To Advise Fiat	Fiat hired John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's former chief executive, to consult on strategy as the car and truck maker gears up to cut production more than previously planned. Mr. Welch, who has been a Fiat board member for more than a year, retired from General Electric in September. The details of his contract with the Italian carmaker have not yet been worked out, said Gualberto Ranieri, a spokesman for Fiat. Fiat will cut production by 8,300 units in the next two months, rather than by 1,800 as it said two weeks ago, Mr. Ranieri said. The company will lay off 3,400 people at its Mirafiori factory in Turin from Jan. 21 to Feb. 10, Mr. Ranieri added.
12/12/2001	Investors Wary of Fiat Plan to Issue Bonds	Investors reacted negatively and with some puzzlement yesterday to one component of the restructuring plan announced Monday by Fiat S.p.A., the struggling Italian automaker -- a $2.2 billion convertible bond issue backed by the 32 million shares of General Motors Corporation stock that Fiat holds. The company also announced plant closings, job cuts and the resignation of Roberto Testore as the chief executive of its carmaking division, which had flat sales last year. He will be replaced by Giancarlo Boschetti, head of the company's much faster-growing truck group.
12/11/2001	Fiat Auto Chief Resigns in Midst of a Revamping	Roberto Testore, the chief executive of Fiat Auto, resigned today as Fiat S.p.A., the parent company, announced a restructuring plan. The restructuring by Fiat, the world's eighth-largest automaker in terms of vehicles sold, reflects the continued struggles of the global auto industry as economic conditions worsen. Fiat will close or overhaul 18 plants and lay off 6,000 workers worldwide by 2004 as part of the moves.
11/27/2001	FOUR COMPANIES JOIN ROLLS-ROYCE ENGINE PROJECT	Rolls-Royce P.L.C., a leading maker of jet engines, said yesterday that Honeywell International Inc., the Goodrich Corporation and units of Fiat S.p.A. and the United Technologies Corporation had agreed to share the development costs of its Trent 900 engine. The companies are joining Volvo A.B. of Sweden, which became a partner in May, Rolls-Royce said. The Trent 900 is being developed to power the four-engine Airbus SAS A380 superjumbo airliner, which is due to enter service in 2006. Honeywell will supply the engine's pneumatic system, while Goodrich will produce the rear and center portions of the fan case. The contract is valued at $1 billion over the expected 25-year life of the A380, said Bill Reavis, a spokesman for Honeywell.
10/5/2001	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Fiat Outlook	Fiat S.p.A. said it would not meet its 2001 targets for operating profit and debt reduction, adding that it planned to cut car production in Italy by 100,000 units by the end of the year. Fiat said demand for nearly all its products, including cars, car parts, industrial vehicles and construction equipment, was expected to fall because of the tumultuous state of the world economy after the terrorist attacks. Previously, Fiat had expected operating profit to rise to about 1.1 billion euros from 854 million euros the year before.
9/21/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: South Korea: Daewoo Deal Expected	Executives of General Motors and the government's Korea Development Bank, lead creditor for the bankrupt Daewoo Motors, were to sign a memorandum of understanding today setting the terms for G.M. to gain control of the company. G.M. and its partner, Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, are to take control of two-thirds of Daewoo Motors while assuming none of nearly $17 billion in liabilities. G.M. is to get Daewoo's two best plants in Korea and an option to take over its aging plant in Inchon after buying cars made there for six years. Don Kirk (NYT)
9/2/2001	Alfa's Return Is Put on Hold	THE Alfisti are going to have to wait a while longer. Alfisti are lovers of Alfa Romeo cars. They dote on their aging Spiders and GTV's and praise the virtues of the Italian marque on dozens of Web sites, including the ''Alfa Babes'' club for women (http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/alfababes).
8/29/2001	European Panel Approves Takeover of Montedison	The European Commission approved the takeover of the Italian power company Montedison by Italenergia, a holding company led by the Fiat Group, today after a routine one-month investigation. But it warned that if ?lectricit de France, a minority shareholder in Italenergia, were to acquire joint control of the combined concern, European regulators would re-examine the case.
7/23/2001	Montedison Accepts Takeover Offer	The board of Montedison S.p.A. accepted a sweetened 5.5 billion euro ($4.79 billion) offer from Fiat S.p.A. and ?lectricit de France today, likely bringing an end to a battle for control of the owner of Italy's second-largest power company. Fiat, Italy's biggest manufacturer, and ?lectricit de France, the state-owned French utility, raised their offer for the 48 percent of Montedison they do not already control to 3.16 euros a share from 3.07 euros.
7/18/2001	World Business Briefing | Europe: Italy: Higher Bid For Montedison	Italenergia, a holding company controlled by Fiat and ?lectricit de France, has increased its offer for Montedison to 3.07 euros a share, or $2.61, from 2.82 euros, valuing Montedison at 5.35 billion euros, or $4.5 billion, up from 4.92 billion euros under an earlier offer. The new bid leaves unchanged the terms of a secondary bid by Italenergia for Montedison's energy subsidiary, Edison. Last week, Montedison set a shareholders' meeting for Aug. 9 to replace the board but gave itself a month to block Italenergia. John Tagliabue (NYT)
4/5/2001	Alternatives Sought On Big Auto Races	DaimlerChrysler A.G., Fiat S.p.A. and other carmakers that sponsor Formula One teams said today that they would set up an alternative to the motor races because their new owner plans to move some events to pay television. The move occurred after Kirch Holding G.m.b.H., a German media company that paid $987.5 million Feb. 28 for joint control of 75 percent of Formula One, said it would consider moving some races to a pay-television channel.
3/22/2001	AUTO PARTS MAKER ACQUIRED	Germany's largest steel maker, ThyssenKrupp, agreed to buy the suspension-making unit of Fiat S.p.A.'s Magneti Marelli auto components subsidiary in a transaction worth as much as 550 million euros ($500 million) to expand its car parts business. ThyssenKrupp will buy 51 percent of the unit and has the option to buy the rest by 2004, it said.
2/17/2001	Big Job Cut at Daewoo Motor Prompts Protests by Workers	The Daewoo Motor Company sent dismissal notices to 1,750 employees today, beginning a long-threatened downsizing. Several hundred workers responded by protesting outside a major Daewoo plant in Pupyong, 20 miles west of Seoul, as their families cheered them.
11/28/2000	LABOR PACT AT DAEWOO	Workers at the Daewoo Motor Company voted to accept layoffs in a restructuring plan, clearing the way for a South Korean court to put the company into receivership rather than liquidate it. Union opposition to layoffs was cited as a main reason creditors forced the company into bankruptcy Nov. 8. The creditors hope to sell a restructured Daewoo to General Motors and Fiat. Samuel Len
10/20/2000	ANOTHER SEAT BELT RECALL IN BRAZIL	The Brazilian unit of the Italian carmaker Fiat plans to recall about 400,000 of its Palio 1.0 cars to reinforce the seat belts. A weakness in the seat belts was detected after a local consumer safety magazine put the car through a series of crash tests. According to Fiat, no accidents have been reported where the seat belts have failed. The recall announcement came less than a week after the Brazilian unit of General Motors recalled 1.32 million Corsa cars for a similar problem. Jennifer L. Rich
10/10/2000	G.M. TO ASSESS DAEWOO ASSETS	The General Motors Corporation and Fiat said they would evaluate the assets and businesses of the Daewoo Motor Company before making any decision about buying all or part of the ailing South Korean automaker. ''G.M. and Fiat will conduct a preliminary due diligence,'' which is ''expected to proceed rapidly and upon further agreement will be followed by formal negotiations,'' General Motors said in a statement. G.M., the world's largest automaker, and Fiat, the sixth largest, became the most likely candidates to purchase Daewoo Motor after the Ford Motor Company withdrew a $7 billion bid last month. Samuel Len
6/29/2000	FORD SAID TO LEAD IN DAEWOO BID	South Korean news reports said Ford Motor had won exclusive negotiating rights to buy the heavily indebted Daewoo Motor from a committee of creditors, beating out rival bids from an alliance between DaimlerChrysler and Hyundai Motor and an alliance between General Motors and Fiat. The Korea Economic Daily said the Ford and Daimler-Hyundai bids were each about $6 billion and the G.M.-Fiat bid was lower. G.M. said its alliance was still bidding. None of the other companies or the creditors would comment on the reports. Samuel Len
6/27/2000	BIDDING FOR DAEWOO	Two leading automakers have formed separate alliances in the international bidding for South Korea's ailing Daewoo Motor. DaimlerChrysler announced a $428 million deal to buy 10 percent of Daewoo's larger domestic competitor, Hyundai Motor, and they submitted a joint bid for Daewoo. General Motors and Fiat announced they also would join forces. Creditors of Daewoo, which carries $18 billion in debt, intend to select a winning bidder by the end of September. The foreign bidders also include Ford Motor. Samuel Len (NYT)
6/2/2000	A Fiat Will Plainly Reign At Greenwich Concours	THE star of the show at the fifth annual Greenwich Concours d'Elegance this weekend isn't an aristocratic Bentley or a pristine Bugatti. It's a much-traveled 1927 Fiat 509 that once hauled fish to market. The Greenwich concours has a tradition of being more than just a beauty show for cars. Each year, its founders, Bruce and Genia Wennerstrom, look for cars that have unusual stories behind them. They have also continued to expand the scope of the event, this year adding classic motorboats, motorcycles and even a vintage airplane. The old Fiat had been owned by Ignazio Franciamore in his home province, Agrigento, in Sicily; he used it as a taxi during World War II, then sold it in the 1950's to a man who used it for fish deliveries. In 1987, an American collector bought the car and brought it to Scranton, Pa. But it was shipped without antifreeze in the motor and the engine block cracked in the Northeast winter, rendering the car unusable. Mr. Franciamore's son, who shares his father's first name and nickname, Iggy, operates a BMW dealership, F & S Motors, in the Bronx. He heard about the old Fiat parked, fittingly, behind a pizza restaurant in Scranton and went to look at it. When he examined the car's papers, he found his father's name on the list of previous owners. He bought the car, restored it, and in 1998 drove it in the Columbus Day parade in Manhattan. Both Iggy Franciamores, the 87-year-old father and his 60-year-old son, are expected to be on hand with the car in Greenwich. The elder Mr. Franciamore is expected to be at the wheel of the Fiat, for the first time since 1944, as the car passes the reviewing stand. More than 280 automobiles are expected at the two-day event, with different cars displayed each day. The theme for the Greenwich Concours d'Elegance tomorrow is cars from the late 1870's to the late 1970's, with both domestic and European cars in the pre-World War II field and American cars only in the postwar section. On Sunday, the Greenwich Concours Europa comprises postwar European sports, touring and competition cars. Among the featured cars will be a Ford GT40 Mk IV that was part of the Ford team that defeated Ferrari at Le Mans in 1967, and a 1933 Rolls-Royce Shooting Brake, or station wagon, that was used by the British Army in its Libya campaign of World War II. Other notable entries include a 1940 Cadillac four-door convertible sedan with side-mounted spare tires; a 1950 Buick Super wood-paneled wagon: a 1953 Ferrari 342 America cabriolet, one of only three built; and a 1929 Stutz Black Hawk Vertical 8 boat-tailed speedster. Once again, the concours will have a circle of supercars, featuring ultra-high-performance cars of recent vintage like a McLaren F1 and a Ferrari F40 -- street-legal models capable of speeds over 180 miles an hour. The event takes place from 10 to 5 both days, with awards presentations starting each day at 3 p.m. Admission is $12, with children 12 and under free if accompanied by an adult; proceeds benefit Americares. The concours takes place at Roger Sherman Baldwin Park, 100 Arch St., in Greenwich, Conn. Further information can be obtained by calling (203) 618-0460.
5/6/2000	FIAT TO BUY COMPANIES	Italy's largest industrial company, Fiat S.p.A., said it would offer to buy the shares it does not already own in the insurer Toro Assicurazioni S.p.A. and in the auto components maker Magneti Marelli S.p.A. for $1.07 billion, to gain greater flexibility in pursuing alliances. Fiat will offer 16 euros ($14.30) for each Toro common share and 12 euros for each savings share. It will pay 5.5 euros for each Magneti common share and 3.8 euros for each savings share.
3/19/2000	After G.M. Deal, Wherefore Art Thou, Alfa Romeo?	THE partnership announced last week between General Motors and Fiat opens a window for the return of Alfa Romeo to the United States. Until it withdrew in 1995, the Italian sports car maker was best known for two-seat convertibles like the Duetto that Dustin Hoffman drove in ''The Graduate.'' In Europe, Alfa Romeo, which is part of Fiat, still sells a sporty two-seat Spider convertible, as well as other models. Its 156, a successful small sport sedan, was voted Europe's 1998 Car of the Year by auto journalists. This month, at the Geneva auto show, the company introduced its 156 Sportwagon, which goes on sale in Italy this month.
3/14/2000	Some See Takeover of Fiat In Details of Deal With G.M.	General Motors and Fiat announced a strategic cooperation deal today that some analysts called a prelude to a G.M. takeover of the troubled automotive operations of Fiat, the Italian industrial giant. Fiat officials stressed that they expected their business to remain independent. The agreement provides for both partners to collaborate broadly in Europe and Latin America in the buying and manufacturing of heavy components like motors and gear shifts. It will give G.M. a 20 percent stake in Fiat's auto division, worth $2.3 billion, in exchange for a 5.15 percent share in G.M. for Fiat.
3/13/2000	Fiat Weighs Sale to G.M. Of a Stake In Auto Line	Fiat is close to selling a minority stake in its car operations to General Motors after apparently failing to sell the entire division to DaimlerChrysler, auto industry officials and executives close to the talks said today. Fiat's board is scheduled to meet on Monday to review the proposed transaction with G.M. and is fairly likely to approve a deal, industry and other executives said today after insisting on anonymity.
2/17/2000	The Gossip of Europe: Talk About Mergers Surrounds Automakers	Europe's automobile industry has gone into overdrive on merger speculation. Today, shares of PSA Peugeot Citroen again rose on rumors that the French automaker was in talks with DaimlerChrysler. The rumors followed persistent speculation about Daimler's seeking to acquire the automobile business of Fiat.
11/13/1999	Ferrari in Deal to Buy Rest of Maserati	Ferrari S.p.A. said today that it had acquired the 50 percent of Maserati that it did not already own, as Ferrari, Italy's top maker of high-performance sports cars, prepares for Maserati's return to the United States market in the coming year. Ferrari bought the stake held in Maserati, which is based in Modena, Italy, from Fiat S.p.A., the Italian carmaker that owns both companies. Financial details were not disclosed. Fiat bought Maserati in 1993 from the De Tomaso family and, in 1997, gave Ferrari half of the company, which was then losing money.
10/24/1999	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Fiat Multipla and Ford Ka; Making the Scene, Avant-Garde Europeans Hit New York's Streets	AZ SNIDER was making his way through the afternoon crush of pedestrians in Rockefeller Center when the sight of a green, four-wheeled, six-passenger frog stopped him cold. ''Man, that is one ugly car,'' Mr. Snider, of Manhattan, volunteered even before he could be asked his opinion of the Fiat Multipla parked near the ''Today'' show studio. Just short of dumbfounded, he seemed unable to take his eyes off the oddly shaped mini-minivan, which has sold briskly in Europe in the year since it went on sale. After sitting at the wheel, though, and poking around in the spacious cabin, Mr. Snyder assessed the car more charitably, conceding that the unusual design incorporated a number of tricks that made the Multipla practical and pleasant. He even mellowed a bit toward the styling.
10/5/1999	FIAT UNIT MAKES PURCHASE	The truck division of Fiat S.A., Iveco, agreed to acquire the French industrial vehicle leasing company Fraikin S.A. for $596 million. Fraikin last year had revenue of $450 million and is France's largest industrial vehicle leaser, Iveco said. Fraikin has nearly 30,000 vehicles in France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Luxembourg among 205 offices.
9/12/1999	Bringing Good Things to Fiat?	FOR most of Fiat's 132,000 Italian employees, breakfast usually consists of little more than an espresso and a newspaper. But on a recent morning, Paolo Fresco sat ramrod straight in a dining room of Fiat's executive suite and, in vaguely accented English, ordered ''scrambled eggs, very soft, and a side order of bacon -- very, very crisp.'' Mr. Fresco, 66, a large athletic man with silvery hair, was born in Italy and holds an Italian passport. Fourteen months ago, he became chairman of Fiat S.p.A., the industrial giant that is one of Italy's biggest corporations. He is, in short, as Italian as they come. But as his culinary preferences reflect, Mr. Fresco's fabric goes well beyond his heritage. For nearly four decades, he worked for General Electric, a darling of American investors, climbing the corporate ladder to become vice chairman under John F. Welch Jr. before retiring from the company last year.
5/28/1999	BRAZIL AUTO DEAL	The Brazilian Government and car makers reached an agreement cutting taxes on automobiles as an effort to save jobs in an industry battered by high interest rates. The accord maintains a previous pact that lowered taxes on small- and medium-sized cars in exchange for pledges from car makers, including General Motors and Fiat, to delay layoffs. Taxes will remain reduced for 90 days; car makers will suspend job cuts for 120 days. The agreement coincided with news that unemployment in Sao Paulo, the heart of the country's auto industry, had risen to a record 20.3 percent in April, from 19.9 percent in March. Simon Romero (NYT)
5/18/1999	Merger Is Set By Makers of Farm Machines	The deal that was struck today to combine the Case Corporation and New Holland N.V., two of the world's largest makers of farm and construction equipment, is just the latest effort to consolidate an embattled farm industry. Although the United States economy remains robust, the sharp drop in commodity prices that began just over a year ago has jolted nearly every company in the agriculture business, and many have chosen to combine in mergers that promise to cut costs and bring renewed hope to investors.
5/17/1999	Merger Is Seen Of Two Makers Of Farm Gear	The Case Corporation and New Holland N.V., two of the world's largest makers of farm and construction equipment, are expected to announce plans to merge on Monday, people who have been briefed on the talks said today. According to those close to the negotiations, Fiat S.p.A. in Italy, which owns 71 percent of New Holland, a Dutch company based in London, would pay about $55 a share in cash for Case, an estimated $4 billion, and merge it with New Holland. Fiat would become the majority shareholder in the new company, which is expected to be renamed.
2/25/1999	VW Shares Tumble On Profit Warning	Volkswagen A.G. shares fell 6.26 percent, or 4.2 euros, to 62.85 ($68.95), and other car shares declined across Europe yesterday after Volkswagen warned that it would be ''difficult'' to raise 1999 profit. The company said that 1998 earnings climbed 65 percent, to a record 2.243 billion Deutsche marks ($1.26 billion), but that slowing fourth-quarter sales led to lower-than-expected 1998 earnings per share of 9.5 marks, 16.6 percent more than in 1997.
2/19/1999	Fiat to Buy Renault Unit	Fiat S.p.A., Europe's No. 3 auto maker, said today that it would buy Renault S.A.'s controlling stake in a unit that makes robots that assemble cars to bolster its Comau factory equipment division. Fiat did not say what it would pay for the 51 percent stake in Renault Automation. It plans to buy Renault's remaining 49 percent stake by January 2004, Renault said. Fiat and Renault have worked together to make buses and cut costs at their steel foundries.
1/29/1999	Ford-Volvo Tie: Europe Rivals at Risk	The Ford Motor Company's victorious bid for Volvo A.B.'s car business increases the pressure on other European automobile companies to either buy or be bought, industry executives and analysts say. Those with the most precarious futures are middle-sized companies like Renault S.A. and PSA Peugeot Citroen of France and, as it clearly recognized by trying to buy Volvo itself, Fiat S.p.A. of Italy. Each of those companies lacks the size to compete with the giants like DaimlerChrysler A.G. or the General Motors Corporation. On top of that, they remain bogged down in brutally competitive markets for midsized and small cars.
1/28/1999	Ford Seen in Deal To Pay $6 Billion For Volvo Car Unit	The Ford Motor Company plans to announce today that it will acquire the passenger car operations of Sweden's A.B. Volvo for between $6 billion and $7 billion, people close to the talks said last night. Ford's deal, which beat a rival bid from Italy's Fiat S.p.A. marks the latest step in the consolidation of the global automotive industry. Giant multinationals are taking over independent companies with strong brand names but limited production capacity and inadequate global distribution.
11/10/1998	Renault and Fiat Plan To Merge Foundry Units	Renault, the French auto company, said yesterday that it intended to merge most of its foundry operations with those of the Italian car maker Fiat S.p.A. The merger will be carried out through Fiat's foundry subsidiary, Teksid S.p.A.. Fiat and Renault will be shareholders in a new Teksid, holding 66.5 percent and 33.5 percent, respectively. Renault's foundry operations will become Teksid subsidiaries.
10/15/1998	Fiat Announces Big Production Cut	Fiat S.p.A., the world's fifth-largest car company and Italy's largest private employer, said yesterday that it would trim production by about 28,000 units in November and December, amid signs of slower economic growth in Italy. The cuts, equal to 41 percent of Fiat's new car registrations in September, come as demand dries up after the end of a Government subsidy program in July.
10/3/1998	FIAT'S MAGNETI ADDS MIDAS SHOPS IN EUROPE	Magneti Marelli S.p.A., a car parts maker controlled by Fiat S.p.A., the world's fifth-largest auto maker, said yesterday that it would buy Midas Inc.'s European repair shops for $100 million as part of a repair alliance that will span South America and Europe. The Chicago-based Midas, which has 2,700 service centers worldwide, will sell the 438 outlets in Europe; of them, 187 are owned outright and 251 are franchises. The repair shops will continue to use Midas technology and methods.
9/26/1998	Economic Detour in Brazil; Global Crisis Pushes Car Makers Into the Slow Lane	The Volkswagen factory here was built for better days. Thanks to aggressive streamlining over the last four years, the plant's 2,304 shift workers, 137 robots and miles of machinery send another boxy Gol subcompact or Parati station wagon into the world every 90 seconds. But finding homes for all of those cars is something else again.
5/8/1998	Mergers Help Fuel a Two-Tier Global Auto Hierarchy	The global auto industry is increasingly divided into two tiers, as a half-dozen giant companies prosper while many of their smaller rivals struggle to manage heavy debts or afford the ever-rising cost of designing new cars. With the pending completion of today's acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz A.G., each of the world's three major auto-producing regions will have two successful, global auto makers. Toyota and Honda are thriving in Japan. General Motors and Ford are enjoying record profits in the United States. Volkswagen and the new DaimlerChrysler, which will have German and American executives but will be dominated by European shareholders, will be the strongest auto makers based in Europe.
5/7/1998	Fiat and Renault Set To Pool Bus Units	The Italian car, truck and bus maker Fiat S.p.A. said yesterday that it would pool its bus-making operations with Renault S.A. of France in a 50-50 joint venture that will become the second-largest bus maker in Europe, behind Daimler-Benz A.G.'s Mercedes-Benz. Fiat said the combined companies would have annual sales of about $1 billion and produce 4,500 buses and 1,500 mini-buses a year. The combination of the bus units of Fiat's Iveco division and Renault's RVI will lead to ''substantial savings,'' the statement said.
4/25/1998	Fiat Profit Rises 32%, Lifted by State Incentives	Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest car maker, said yesterday that its pretax profit rose 32 percent in the first quarter, bolstered by state incentives to buy new cars and strong truck sales, though it reported a slide in profit at its car division because of difficulties in Brazil. Fiat, which also ranks as Italy's largest industrial company, said its first-quarter pretax profit was 655 billion lire ($368.1 million), compared with 495 billion lire ($278.2 million) a year earlier, in line with expectations. Operating profit rose to 545 billion lire ($306.3 million) from 450 billion lire ($252.9 million), and sales rose 10.7 percent, to 23 trillion lire ($12.93 billion).
4/21/1998	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Europe Takes To the Road In a Small Way; Despite Hefty Price Tags, Micro-Cars Gain a Toehold	Imagine a car 8 feet 2 inches long, with just two seats, whose diesel engine, purring like an outboard motor, propels it at a top speed of 27 miles an hour. Imagine a transmission so basic that it has only two settings, forward and reverse. Yes, there is such a car, and it is made in this town in western France. Amazingly, it sells for about 10 percent more than the smallest fully equipped models of Nissan, Ford or Fiat.
4/10/1998	LEAR CORP. TO BUY TWO ITALIAN MAKERS OF DOOR PANELS	The Lear Corporation, the automotive parts maker based in Southfield, Mich., agreed yesterday to buy two closely held Italian makers of automobile door panels and overhead liners for an undisclosed amount of cash. The acquisitions of Gruppo Pianfei and Strapazzini Resine, Lear's latest expansion in Europe, are expected to help Lear's business with the Italian auto maker Fiat. Pianfei, Europe's 10th-largest independent door panel supplier and the No. 5 seller of overhead systems, and Strapazzini had $130 million in combined revenue in 1997. Lear shares rose $1.375, to $56.375. Gruppo Pianfei employs 870 workers in six plants throughout Italy. Strapazzini Resine, with headquarters in Pesaro, has 200 workers in two plants.
1/23/1998	Fiat Chief Wants G.E. Officer as Successor	The chairman of Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest corporation, said today that he would step down in June and would recommend that Paolo Fresco, a vice chairman of the General Electric Company, take his place. The chairman, Cesare Romiti, who took over in 1996 from Giovanni Agnelli, the grandson of the founder of the giant auto group, said on Italian television that he would propose Mr. Fresco as his successor when the Fiat board meets on Jan. 30.
12/15/1997	Fiat Heir's Death Unlikely to Affect Company's Success	The death of the heir to the Fiat automobile empire, Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, will have little impact on day-to-day operations at the industrial conglomerate, company officials said today. Mr. Agnelli's death from cancer on Saturday will leave a gap at the top of Piaggio, the motor scooter company controlled by the Agnelli family. He took over as chief executive of Piaggio in 1993 and turned it around after several years of losses.
12/12/1997	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International; Sports Cars Europe Keeps for Itself	NOT long after it was invented, the automobile became a prime instrument of human expression. For almost a century, motorists have selected personal transportation in the belief that what they drove held meaning beyond its function. Today, sport utility vehicles are imagined to confer an aura of action, adventure and environmental awareness on their owners, even if most of their time is spent idling in traffic jams. In an earlier age, drivers who wanted to stand apart often chose sports cars, typically two-seat roadsters with superior handling, performance and economy.
11/14/1997	Brazilian Slowdown Forces Rethinking and Retrenching	Southeast Asian auto sales have collapsed, and now the other shoe has dropped for the world's biggest auto makers. After years of spectacular growth, the Brazilian auto market -- the largest of any emerging-market country -- is facing a severe slowdown as the Government there has doubled interest rates, raised income taxes and slashed spending to prevent Asia's currency turmoil from spreading across the Pacific.
10/28/1997	Owner of Rolls-Royce Plans Sale of Luxury Auto Maker	Rolls-Royce Motor Cars P.L.C., a quintessentially British emblem of quality craftsmanship, purring performance and class, was put up for sale today and will almost certainly pass into foreign hands. Vickers P.L.C., the military and engineering group that is the corporate parent of Rolls-Royce, said it was selling the subsidiary to concentrate on what its chairman, Sir Colin Chandler, identified as its core businesses of armored vehicle and propulsion technology products. Sir Colin said a growing number of possible suitors had expressed interest in Rolls-Royce, but he did not identify any.
7/22/1997	Fiat Is Investing $1 Billion in India	Fiat, the Italian auto maker, will invest $1 billion in India in the next five years, partly to set up three new factories, the auto maker said yesterday.
4/25/1997	Fiat's Earnings Increased 10.4% Last Year	Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest company, said today that its profits rose 10.4 percent in 1996, which was larger than expected, because of one-time gains. It said, however, that profitability did not pick up much in the first quarter of 1997. For 1996, the company earned 2.37 trillion lire ($1.39 billion), or 477 lire a share, up from 2.15 trillion in 1995. Analysts had been expecting profits of about 2.2 trillion lire, or 440 lire a share.
4/10/1997	Italy Convicts Fiat Chairman; Bars Him From Corporate Posts	The chairman of Fiat S.p.A., Italy's biggest corporation, was convicted yesterday of having falsified company accounts, committing tax fraud and making illegal payments to political parties. He was barred from holding corporate office in Italy. Cesare Romiti, 73 -- who took over as the head of Fiat a year ago when Giovanni Agnelli, the grandson of the giant auto company's founder, reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 -- was sentenced by a court in Fiat's headquarters city, Turin, to an 18-month suspended prison term.
1/1/1997	Sales Incentives Bolster Fiat Shares	Shares of Fiat S.p.A., the Italian auto maker, jumped yesterday as investors wagered that car sales incentives approved by the Government on Monday would increase Fiat's operating profit.
12/13/1996	Fiat to Lay Off Workers Temporarily	Fiat S.p.A. plans 25,900 temporary layoffs of workers in January as new car sales falter, Italian television reported yesterday.
11/19/1996	Fiat Operating Profit Off 32% in 9 Months	Struggling with a weak Italian car market, Fiat S.p.A. reported yesterday that its operating profit fell 32 percent for the first nine months of the year. The Turin-based auto maker blamed sagging sales in Italy and a slowdown in demand for industrial vehicles. It also cited strong price competition from rivals and costs associated with new models.
10/23/1996	Big Fund Manager Acquired in Italy	Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. of Italy said yesterday that it had paid 325 billion lire ($213 million) to acquire Prime Gestioni S.p.A., a fund management company controlled by Fiat S.p.A., and to increase its stake in Prime Augusta Vita S.p.A., the life insurance subsidiary of Prime Gestioni, to 40 percent from 18 percent. Prime Gestioni is Italy's 12th-largest investment fund company. With Prime Gestioni, Generali's funds under management will grow from 3.4 percent of the Italian market to 6.4 percent, making it Italy's fifth-largest fund management company.
9/14/1996	Fiat Plans Layoffs And Production Cuts	Fiat S.p.A., the Italian car maker, said yesterday that it would cut production by 9,400 automobiles in October and lay off thousands of workers temporarily. The company plans to lay off about 15,000 workers in the third and fourth weeks of October, followed by 8,500 workers the week after. A continuing slowdown in car sales in Italy was cited for the layoffs. (AP)
7/19/1996	From Italy, a Model T for the 90's;Fiat Joins Race to Build a Car With Worldwide Appeal	"When Fiat, with Latin frenzy, brought out its """"world car"""" in Brazil in April, the big Italian auto maker called it the Palio, after the breakneck horse race that the Tuscan city of Siena has staged in its cobbled lanes since the Middle Ages. It is an aptly named effort because the goal of designing a car that can be built and sold in pretty much the same form worldwide is fast becoming something of a steeplechase on wheels. And for Fiat, which has had trouble reaching out beyond Europe, the Palio represents its most ambitious marketing attempt to compete with its Japanese and American rivals."
6/27/1996	Fiat Expects Profits To Remain Same In '96	The Italian industrial giant Fiat S.p.A. said yesterday that it expected profits for the year to be in line with those from last year. The chairman, Cesare Romiti, said at the annual shareholders' meeting that the output of new car and tractor models would reach capacity this year. Mr. Romiti said plans were under way to sell a stake of 30 percent to 40 percent of New Holland, a Fiat subsidiary that is the world's largest farm machinery maker, by the end of this year, with a public offering planned in New York. (Reuters)
4/2/1996	Dante Giacosa, 91, Dies; Designed the Fiat 500	Dante Giacosa, the auto designer whose career at Fiat spanned nearly half a century and who brought forth such models as the Fiat 500, which motorized Italy in the 1950's, died Sunday in Turin. He was 91. Mr. Giacosa was born in Rome while his father, a Piedmontese, was doing military service here. He obtained a degree from the Polytechnic University in Turin, the chief city of Piedmont and Fiat's headquarters, and joined the auto maker in 1928.
1/19/1996	Fiat to Cut Production	Blaming a continuing crisis of the European auto market, Fiat, the Italian auto maker, said this week that it planned to put thousands of workers on temporary layoffs to curtail its production in February. Fiat said it would produce 21,000 fewer vehicles next month, but it did not disclose how many cars it would have produced without the cutback. Under a temporary state-supported unemployment program, 26,800 workers will be laid off in the week between Jan. 29 and Feb. 4 while 12,000 will be affected in the week of Feb. 5-11. Fiat said that the cutback would affect older models; newer models, like the midsized Bravo and Brava, would proceed as scheduled.
12/23/1995	Alcatel to Sell Fiat Stake of 2%	"The French industrial company Alcatel Alsthom said yesterday that it planned to sell its 2 percent stake in the Italian car maker Fiat next year, ending a relationship that was once hailed as """"an example for Europe."""" A spokesman for Alcatel said the company's new chairman, Serge Tchuruk, had ended a deal with the Agnelli family holding companies IFI and IFIL and was now free to sell its Fiat shares in 1996. Mr. Tchuruk, appointed in July, plans to sell 10 billion francs ($2.02 billion) in assets in the next two years as part of a drastic overhaul of the ailing company. In Turin, Istituto Finanziario Internazionale said it and IFIL were ready to buy Alcatel's stake. (Reuters)"
12/15/1995	Fiat Selects Its Next Chief	Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest company, said yesterday that Paolo Cantarella, the head of its car division, would become chief executive of the whole company. He will replace Cesare Romiti, who in turn is replacing its chairman, Giovanni Agnelli, who announced earlier this week that he would retire next year. Mr. Cantarella has led a turnaround at Fiat's main division and was favored to take over from Mr. Romiti. Fiat also said that Mr. Agnelli had proposed that an age limit of 75 for board members be reinstated. Mr. Agnelli will turn 75 on March 12. Mr. Romiti is 72. Mr. Agnelli has said in the past that his 32-year-old nephew, Giovanni Agnelli, will take over Fiat one day. (Bloomberg Business News)
12/12/1995	Agnelli Says He Will Retire From Fiat Post	"Giovanni Agnelli, the patrician head of Fiat S.p.A. who turned the family auto business into an international conglomerate, announced today that he would step down """"within the next few months,"""" after 30 years as chairman. Addressing an annual gathering in Turin of Fiat executives from around the world, Mr. Agnelli named as his successor the managing director of Fiat, Cesare Romiti."
12/8/1995	Italian Prosecutors Seek Fraud Trial of No. 2 Fiat Executive	Italian prosecutors formally requested today that the No. 2 executive at the Fiat group, Cesare Romiti, stand trial in connection with accusations that the company maintained slush funds from which it made illegal payments to politicians in exchange for public contracts. A final decision whether Mr. Romiti, Fiat's managing director, should stand trial has yet to be made by a court that functions much the way a grand jury does in the United States. But the request was nonetheless a major setback to the campaign by Fiat to stave off a trial and clear its name.
11/9/1995	Fiat Deal in Ukraine	Fiat S.p.A. said today that it had agreed to a joint venture to produce light and medium trucks in Ukraine with Kraz. The joint venture will be capitalized at $40 million, rising to $60 million within the first two years of operation. Fiat and Kraz will each have a 35 percent interest.
9/26/1995	Fiat and Renault Campaign for the Compact-Car Market	It had all the trappings of a carnival, but it was really a declaration of war. For 12 days this month, this smoggy northern Italian city became a burst of bright bunting, music and street theater, as the big Fiat S.p.A. automobile company introduced a range of compact cars bearing the names Bravo and Brava. Earlier, in Barcelona's huge Olympic Stadium, in northern Spain, France's Renault S.A. displayed, with a bit less fanfare but equal hopes, a similar line of cars called Megane. Both car makers have traditionally been linked in European minds with their staples, mini-cars and subcompacts. Their new models, priced aggressively and with a styling that has more Latin flair than northern European stolidity, are a frontal assault on the next level in the European market: slightly larger and sturdier compacts. That is the largest, most profitable segment -- but one that they have all but ceded to Volkswagen A.G., the Ford Motor Company and the Adam Opel A.G. division of the General Motors Corporation.
8/30/1995	International Briefs; Midsize Car From Fiat	Fiat, the Italian auto maker, introduced a midsize car yesterday that it hopes will break the European dominance of Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford Motor. The introduction of the new car line, which is being marketed under the names Bravo and Brava, is being marked by 10 days of events in Turin, Italy, Fiat's home. Bravo is a two-door sporty sedan aimed at young professionals, while the five-door Brava hatchback is being marketed to the family travel segment. The company hopes to sell 350,000 of the two models a year, split equally between Italy and abroad. (AP)
7/1/1995	International Briefs; Fiat Says Sales Rose 25% in First 5 Months	The chairman of Fiat S.p.A., Giovanni Agnelli, told shareholders yesterday that revenue in the first five months of the year rose 25 percent from a year ago, helped in part by the success of the Punto small-sized car. Sales at Fiat, Italy's largest company, rose to 31.831 trillion lire, or $19 billion, from 25.478 trillion lire in the period a year earlier.
6/3/1995	International Briefs;Fiat Bounced Back To Profit in 1994	Italy's largest private company, Fiat S.p.A., reported 1994 net profit of 1.251 trillion lire $764 million, as brisk sales of its new Punto car and more robust car sales in general pulled the group out of the red. Fiat lost 1.783 trillion lire in 1993. The 1994 results were in line with expectations. Analysts have attributed Fiat's success in bouncing back from the company's only annual loss since the 1970's to Europe's recovering car and truck market as well as the lira's decline against other European currencies. First-quarter sales for 1995 increased 28 percent, to 18.6 trillion lire; Fiat said this would bolster earnings for the year beyond corporate targets, which it did not specify. For the first three months of 1995, Fiat said operating profit was 4.4 percent of sales, or 818 billion lire.
5/17/1995	Small-Car Politics	To the Editor: A May 10 Business Day article describes two small cars, the Fiat Cinquecento and the Renault Twingo, as adorable, comfortable and economical to operate. Conjectures were offered about American reluctance to buy these cars.
5/10/1995	Small Cars, Big Comeback; Europeans Rekindle Their Love Affair With Bugs	"Giovanni Grimaldi is in love, and he's not embarrassed to talk about it. """"We used to have a traditional car, you know, with a front and back, but it was big outside and small inside,"""" said Mr. Grimaldi, a 45-year-old sound engineer here. Then he laid eyes on a Twingo, a perky little car built by Renault of France."
3/28/1995	Car Makers Gaining Momentum in Brazil	Aiming to make Brazil a leading world car manufacturer by the end of the decade, the four biggest car makers in Brazil are doubling their investment, and new companies are planning to start assembly lines in this country. In rapid succession over the last few weeks, Ford announced a $2 billion investment; General Motors, a $2 billion expansion, and Volkswagen, $3 billion. Fiat said it intended to invest $1 billion in Brazil and $600 million in Argentina. Fiat's operation in Brazil is the Italian company's largest and most profitable.
3/8/1995	EXIDE AGREES TO ACQUIRE BATTERY UNIT OF FIAT	The Exide Corporation, a battery maker based in Reading, Pa., has agreed to acquire all the capital stock of the battery unit of the Italian auto maker Fiat S.p.A. for about $550 million. The executive vice president and chief financial officer of Exide, Alan E. Gauthier, said Exide planned to pay for the acquisition with $200 million raised in December through the issue of 5.1 million new shares. The remaining $350 million will be financed with bank debt. The two companies said last October that they had signed a letter of intent to discuss the acquisition of the unit, called Compagnie Europeene d'Accumulateurs S.A., which at the time was valued at about $535 million.
1/25/1995	U.S. Sales Halt By Alfa Romeo	The Italian car maker Fiat S.p.A. said today that it would stop making its Alfa Romeo cars for the North American market after this year because of heavy losses. That will mean the end of Fiat's passenger-car presence in the United States. Fiat also makes cars under its own name and under the name Lancia, although they are not sold in the United States or Canada.
11/13/1994	Technology; Fiat Hopes to Put a Tilt Into Amtrak's Trains	ADVANCED railroad technology pioneered in Europe by the Italian auto maker Fiat may soon make it much faster and more comfortable for travelers in the northeastern United States to get from one big city to another. Fiat, based here, intends to bid on a $600 million contract to provide tilting trains to Amtrak in the United States. It developed the system for such trains in the late 1960's and has delivered roughly 70 percent of those now operating worldwide.
9/16/1994	LEAR SEATING AGREES TO ACQUIRE UNIT OF FIAT	The Lear Seating Corporation said yesterday that it would acquire the automotive seat-making business of Fiat S.p.A. for $160 million. Lear, based in Southfield, Mich., said it had signed a letter of intent with Gilardini S.p.A., a Fiat subsidiary, to purchase its SEPI S.p.A. unit. SEPI is the primary supplier of automotive seating systems to Fiat, the Italian auto maker. Lear is to begin making seats for Fiat in Europe with the 1995 model year. Shares of Lear rose 12.5 cents, to $18.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. SEPI produced seats for more than a million vehicles in 1993 and had sales of about $350 million. It has eight production operations in Italy.
5/13/1994	Fiat Reports Big 1993 Loss	Fiat S.p.A. reported today that it sustained a deep loss in 1993 but that its sales grew 11 percent during the first three months of 1994, returning it to a profit at the operating level. Fiat said it lost 1.783 trillion lire, or about $1.1 billion, after tax last year, compared with a profit of 551 billion lire in 1992.
5/1/1994	Fiat Looks Beyond the Bad Old Days	FIAT S.p.A., Italy's largest private company, is beginning to approach its businesses as if guided by the adage that the prospect of the gallows can do wonders to focus the mind. The company is overhauling itself. It is in the midst of a $24 billion program to bring out 18 new models in the next two years. It is shedding some businesses. It is streamlining and strengthening its farm-equipment unit. It is bidding to supply high-speed trains in the United States. And it has changed the balance of power on its board in return for new investment.
2/12/1994	FIAT TO USE TEMPORARY LAYOFFS TO CUT CAR PRODUCTION	Fiat S.p.A. said yesterday that it would use temporary layoffs to cut its car production by 24,200 in the month starting on Monday because of the continued crisis in Italy's car market. Fiat used temporary layoffs to cut its production by 36,500 in November, and by 28,000 in October. Factories in Italy largely close during Christmas and in early January, so the company did not have temporary layoffs. Fiat produced about 1.7 million cars in Italy last year, down from more than two million two years ago.
2/5/1994	COMPANY BRIEFS	ALLIED SIGNAL INC., Morristown, N.J., acquired a seat belt business in Italy from the automotive supplier Gilardini, which is majority owned by Fiat Group. Terms were not disclosed. MOBIL CORP., Fairfax, Va., plans to increase its capital and exploration expenditures by $600 million this year, from $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion.
10/22/1993	COMPANY BRIEFS	FIAT S.p.A., Turin, Italy, will merge the construction and public works activities of its Cogefar-Impresit subsidiary with those of two privately owned construction companies, Lodigiani and Girola. NORTHWEST AIRLINES INC., St. Paul, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will merge their Dutch cargo operations, combining the marketing, sales and handling services under KLM Cargo.
9/29/1993	A Struggling Fiat Seeks $3.1 Billion in New Capital	Fiat S.p.A., Italy's unprofitable unprofitable automotive and industrial giant, announced plans today for a $3.1 billion recapitalization and said Gianni Agnelli, its longtime chairman, would postpone his planned retirement from the company for at least two years. A company statement did not explain Mr. Agnelli's decision to delay his scheduled retirement next year that would have placed his younger brother, Umberto, at the top of the family-controlled company, Italy's largest private enterprise. But analysts interpreted it as a sign of the severity of the corporation's mounting financial troubles.
9/11/1993	LAYOFFS TO BE USED TO CUT OCTOBER FIAT OUTPUT	Fiat S.p.A. said it would use temporary layoffs to cut its car production by 28,300 in October, about half the production cut being made in September. A Fiat spokesman said the company is slowing down the rate of its production cuts because August's car sales figures were not as poor as recent months. Anfia, the Italian car dealers association, reported last week that care sales fell 19.6 percent in August from a year ago, slower than July's 28.8 percent and June's 29.5 percent declines. The number of workers that will be asked to work part time or not at all will vary from 12,000 to 31,000 a week in October.
7/1/1993	Troubles Deepen for Fiat and Ferruzzi, Italy's Biggest Family-Run Empires	Italy's richest family-owned business empires acknowledged deepening troubles today with their separate companies. Fiat, the giant auto and industrial company controlled by the Agnellis, forecast a near-tripling of debt to some $7 billion by the end of the year, and the reigning heirs of the Ferruzzi family resigned from their debt-laden holding company. The woes affecting the two dynasties came as a further illustration of Italy's problems in pulling out of a recession that has been worsened by Europe's slowdown. In the case of Fiat, today's pronouncements about its debt showed how much the company was gambling on improvement in the European auto markets by mid-1994. The hope is that Fiat's investments will pay off in a recovery,
6/8/1993	Web of Scandal: A special report.; Neither Votes Nor Candor Lighten the Pall Over Italy	It is now almost a year and a half since Italy's corruption scandal erupted, and hundreds of prominent executives and politicians have been humiliated or ruined by the revelations. Not only has the scandal touched virtually every political party and corporation; it has also demonstrated the hollowness of Italy's economy, where hundreds of millions of dollars -- some say billions -- have been wasted in payoffs and other bribes. The Political Damage As local elections showed on Sunday, the damage wrought to the established parties has redefined Italy's political geography.
6/6/1993	World Markets; A Flurry of Bad News From Fiat	EMBROILED in the country's vast corruption scandal, Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest private company, posted sharply lower 1992 profits last week, slashed its dividend for the second year running and announced a huge increase in its debt. While the results pushed down share prices, the principal medium-term preoccupation among investors was whether the Turin auto giant, gambling that the introduction of new model lines in the mid-1990's will reverse its fortunes, would reap a substantial payoff in productivity and sales from the massive, $27 billion investment program it has underway.
5/27/1993	Fiat Seeks Financing to Pay Idled Workers	One day after Italy's corruption scandal gnawed deeper into the top management of Fiat S.p.A., the company acknowledged further troubles today, saying it had applied to the Government for special financing to pay for layoffs in its big auto subsidiary. The chairman of Fiat, Gianni Agnelli, said earlier this month that the group -- Italy's biggest private company -- expected to report sharply lower profits of about $340 million for 1992 when annual results are announced next week. Profits in 1991 were 1.114 trillion lira, or about $750 million at current exchange rates.
5/12/1993	Fiat, in Scandal, Adopts Ethics Code	"Seeking to extricate itself from Italy's huge year-old corruption scandal, Fiat S.p.A., Italy's biggest private company, today became the first corporation in the country to issue a code of ethical conduct for its employees. The code, said by Fiat executives to be modeled on those used by leading American corporations, forbids any of Fiat's 300,000 employees to offer bribes of any kind -- including sponsorships or consultancies -- to public officials or politicians to promote corporate interests """"even if under illicit pressures."
4/19/1993	Corruption at Fiat Is Admitted by Chairman	Facing accusations of his company's entanglement in Italy's vast kickback scandal, Gianni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat S.p.A., made his first public acknowledgment over the weekend of corporate corruption and urged investigators to speed up their inquiries to establish the depth of the problem. Apparently seeking to avert deeper damage, Mr. Agnelli was also reported by Italian state radio and television to have ordered Fiat's managing director, Cesare Romiti, to volunteer for questioning by magistrates in Milan this week about the auto giant's affairs.
3/27/1993	Fiat Angered by Accusation of Slush Fund	Fiat S.p.A., Italy's biggest private company, reacted angrily today to accusations that it maintained an illegal slush fund and took part the country's widening corruption scandal. Fiat headquarters in Turin issued a statement today in response to the news on Thursday that investigating magistrates had refused bail for two Fiat executives arrested in the scandal last month on the ground that they might tamper with evidence if freed.
3/3/1993	Web of Scandal: A special report.; Broad Bribery Investigation Is Ensnaring the Elite of Italy	What started a year ago as a modest bribe for a cleaning contract in Milan has grown into one of the most extraordinary scandals of postwar Europe, revealing the vast corruption that cements patronage and power among Italy's political barons. Italy's many previous scandals have implicated the mob, the generals, the Vatican or the politicians. But the recent revelations have exposed startling levels of bribery involving the power elite, once an untouchable network of dynasties, family money, state largesse and high-flying entrepreneurs.
2/23/1993	Two Arrests Embroil Fiat In Scandal	Two high-ranking Fiat S.p.A. executives were arrested today in a growing year-old scandal involving hundreds of Italian politicians and officeholders accused of trading public works contracts for bribes used to finance their political parties. The arrests of the two -- on suspicion of corruption as officers of a Fiat construction subsidiary -- brought the scandal closer to the auto giant that symbolizes Italy's business sector. News of the arrests buffeted Fiat shares and rippled through the Milan stock exchange, where companies owned by the Agnelli family, which controls Fiat, account for 12 percent of the market's capitalization. Stock's Rise Halted Since Feb. 11, Fiat common shares had surged 19 percent, from 4,520 lire to 5,385 lire, apparently on rumors that a French or Japanese auto maker or a German bank was about to buy a stake. The arrests brought the surge to a halt, and Fiat shares fell five-tenths of 1 percent, to 5,350 lire, or about $3.41 a share, after a day of seesawing on the market.
2/12/1993	FIAT TRIMS WORK FORCE FOR MARCH TO REDUCE OUTPUT	Fiat Auto S.p.A., the Italian auto maker, said yesterday that 24,000 workers would work part time or not at all in the month starting on March 8, reducing production by 23,000 cars. The cuts were decided at a meeting with Fiat's workers' union.
2/10/1993	Fiat Deal With Iraq	Fiat S.p.A. has received permission from the United Nations to sell $130 million worth of tractors and combined harvesters to Iraq, a Fiat spokeswoman said today. The tractors will be provided by Fiat's New Holland unit, which was formed last year when Fiat bought the Ford Motor Company's agricultural machinery division.
11/17/1992	Fiat's Output Goal in Poland	Fiat S.p.A. expects its newly acquired Polish subsidiary, Fiat Auto Poland, to produce 80,000 Fiat 500 cars this year, 20,000 below its original target, as a result of a 54-day strike that ended in early September, a Fiat official said today. Production at the Tychy plant in southern Poland is 620 cars a day, the official said. The factory has been producing a version of the Fiat 500, a small two-door model with little resemblance to the original 500.
9/26/1992	Fiat Profit Off	Fiat S.p.A. said pretax profit dropped to 655 billion lire, or $521 million, in the first half of 1992 from 1.455 trillion lire a year earlier. Consolidated sales totaled 30.142 trillion lire in the first half, up from 29.497 trillion.
7/15/1992	FIAT TO SET UP HEAVY-EQUIPMENT VENTURE WITH HITACHI	Fiat S.p.A., the Italian auto maker, said yesterday that it and the Hitachi Construction Machinery Company had agreed to set up a joint venture to make bulldozers and other earth-moving equipment. The venture, to be called Fiat Hitachi Construction Equipment S.p.A., will be 80 percent owned by Fiat's N.H. Geotech and 20 percent by Fiat Hitachi Excavators S.p.A. Fiat Hitachi Excavators is itself a venture of Fiat, Hitachi and Sumitomo. The new venture will have its headquarters and factory in the Puglia region of southern Italy.
7/1/1992	Fiat Reports 39% Decline In Earnings	Fiat S.p.A., the Italian automobile and industrial giant, said today that 1991 profits fell 39 percent, to the lowest level in four years. The 90-year-old company forecast a continued squeeze as it pursues a $40 billion program to modernize production and update aging car designs.
2/15/1992	Fiat-Pfizer Deal	Fiat S.p.A.'s Sorin Biomedica will buy Pfizer Inc.'s Shiley operations in the United States, Germany and Italy for $230 million, Fiat said. Shiley makes artificial organs, mainly in the cardio-surgical products. Fiat said the sale is effective Feb. 28. Sorin Biomedica had 1991 sales of 700 billion lire, or about $572 million.
12/26/1991	Fiat's First Family Seeks To Offset an Auto Slump	Faced with the likelihood of several troubled years in the auto industry and a looming, unpredictable challenge from Japan, the Agnelli family that controls Fiat S.p.A., Italy's greatest car-making empire, is looking elsewhere to offset the potential damage, executives and analysts say. That has been the thinking behind a strategy in recent years to diversify into the French food, hotel and beverage market as Fiat's car-making operations have slumped in the see-sawing European and domestic markets.
12/10/1991	New Fiat From Poland Draws on Old Mystique	In an unmarked workshop on an unassuming street in a suburb of gray and wintry Turin, engineers are going through the motions of keeping the least-kept secret of Italian motoring -- a new Fiat mini-car that, for many Italians will recall the cramped Fiat 500, which motorized the nation in the 1950's. The car, at present, is literally under wraps. Pre-introduction test models are disguised by masking tape that blurs their lines and covers the name. Word of the new arrival, though, long ago seeped out as Fiat S.p.A., long Italy's leading employer and the second-largest European auto maker, after Volkswagen, tries to find a new niche in the mini-car market. For many years that market was its staple, until competition increased from Volkswagen and Ford.
11/26/1991	Fiat Chief's Brother Viewed as Successor	"Gianni Agnelli, the 70-year-old chairman of Italy's Fiat Corporation, seeking anew to dispel speculation about his likely successor, said in an interview published over the weekend that he had """"not the slightest doubt"""" that his younger brother Umberto was """"perfectly prepared"""" to take over from him. The issue of the succession at Italy's Turin-based corporate giant has raised frequent questions in the past, particularly following power struggles in the late 1980's between senior executives and Cesare Romiti, managing director, who has also been mentioned as a possible interim successor."
10/8/1991	Business Scene; Figuring a Price On a Soviet Deal	AMONG the Soviet Union's collection of industrial operations, the Volga Automotive Plant Association is the first big target for Western investment. A 30 percent ownership stake in this Russian version of General Motors is to be sold soon, probably to Fiat S.p.A. But what should Fiat pay? What is Volga Autos worth? Bear, Stearns & Company, the Wall Street firm, is using Western techniques to answer this question. Its price tag, due this month, is likely to reflect Soviet politics and guesswork as much as financial analysis. The Bear, Stearns effort, undertaken at the request of the Soviet Government, is important because it offers an analytic approach for valuing a company that operates in a society without normal guidelines, like stock prices, real estate values and the cost of labor, once the Government no longer sets Soviet wages. The goal is to come up with a cash-flow figure -- a rough measure of Volga Auto's potential earnings in hard currency that would indicate the return on Fiat's investment.
8/31/1991	Italian Group In Texas Deal	A group of Italian investors led by SCI, a large development and construction company, said it acquired 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space from the Texas bank unit of the NCNB Corporation for approximately $120 million. In addition to SCI, investors include Roev General Inc.; subsidiaries of the Pirelli Group and Fiat, and other Italian businesses.
8/20/1991	MOSCOW AND THE MARKETS: Kremlin Shake-Up Jars the Financial World; Ambitions for Soviet Deals Are Suddenly Placed on Ice	The march of foreign private investment into the Soviet Union seemed to freeze mid-stride yesterday, as business executives watched the events in Moscow with confusion and concern, struggling to decipher what the shift in leadership means for their own fledgling ventures there. At least one major project, the planned privatization of the Soviet automobile ministry through a possible deal with Fiat, the Italian auto manufacturer, has been put on hold, said Alan Siegel, a New York lawyer who has been representing the ministry in the negotiations.
7/24/1991	Soviets Plan to Sell 30% Interest In Big State-Owned Auto Maker	In a step toward capitalist reform, the Soviet Union is planning to sell a large stake in a big industrial corporation to a foreign investor, advisers to the Soviet Government said yesterday. The state-owned company, the Volga Automotive Plant Association, is the country's dominant producer of passenger cars. Its no-frills Lada sedans, sold throughout Europe and Canada but not in the United States, are the Soviet Union's leading manufactured export. The Government intends to sell at least 30 percent of the company, a holding that recent Soviet press reports have speculated may be worth more than $1 billion.
6/29/1991	Fiat Exports Up	"Fiat S.p.A., the Italian automotive giant, said its European exports were improving but that its earnings for the year would probably be lower than in 1990. Fiat Auto, the group's car-making unit, posted a 7.5 percent increase European sales in the January-to-May period this year, compared with a year earlier. """"Fiat Auto is making money,"""" said Giulio Merlani, Fiat's finance director. Analysts have projected that Fiat's profits could drop to $538 million this year, from $1.2 billion last year, on a 5 percent rise in revenues, to about $46 billion."
6/24/1991	Weeklong Fiat Closings	The Italian auto maker Fiat S.p.A. says it plans to idle most of its manufacturing plants in the final weeks of July and September to reduce excess inventory. The move will temporarily lay off 50,000 workers, or nearly half of Fiat's 115,000 work force, a spokesman said on Friday. The two weeks of layoffs will reduce production by 80,000 cars. Fiat has closed plants for one week every month since February in response to sluggish demand in the European car market and the decline of its share of the Italian market.
6/11/1991	Furlough at Fiat	Fiat S.p.A., the Italian automobile giant, said it would lay off 41,000 workers, or a third of its work force, later this month for one week to curtail production. Since February, slack demand has been forcing temporary layoffs by the car maker. Fiat said it had told unions that the 41,000 workers in its northern and southern Italian factories would be laid off beginning June 24 to cut production by 25,000 cars for the month.
5/24/1991	Fiat-Soviet Deal	Fiat S.p.A., the Italian auto maker, said it had signed a preliminary agreement to acquire 30 percent of the leading Soviet auto maker and increase that company's production. Fiat said financial terms had not yet been worked out in the deal with Volskij Avtomobilnij Zavod. The accord will replace an agreement Fiat signed in 1989 to take a 31 percent stake in the production of cars at a Soviet plant at Yelabug, 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow. The new preliminary agreement seeks to increase Volskij Avtomobilnij Zavod's production by 300,000 cars a year, to 1.05 million, through the joint development of a new mid-sized model, Fiat said.
5/3/1991	Fiat Takeover of Ford Unit	The European Commission today approved the takeover of the Ford Motor Company's European farm machinery subsidiary by Fiat S.p.A. after the Italian company made a key concession. It approved the deal for Ford New Holland after Fiat agreed to end its exclusive supply deals in Italy, enabling competitors to enter that country.
4/15/1991	Market Place; Fiat's Shares Rise Despite Problems	FIAT'S shares have jumped 22 percent since January, when they fell to their lowest level since 1985. But many analysts still lack faith in the Italian auto maker. A few analysts say that for patient investors who are not afraid to take risks, Fiat might be a good cyclical bet on a rebound in Europe's auto industry, which is not expected for several months. But most analysts say that despite the stock's recent bounce, investors should shy away because Fiat, Italy's largest private company, is in a tough position in a soft market.
3/21/1991	Five-Day Layoff For 35,000 at Fiat	Fiat, Italy's auto giant, said it would lay off 35,000 workers for five days beginning on Monday in a cutback of its monthly production by about 20,000 units. Workers will get about 90 percent of regular pay during the layoff period through a special state fund. A spokesman said that the decision, affecting one-third of Fiat's automobile work force, had been made in view of a worldwide slowing of car sales. On the Italian market, auto sales fell 6.4 percent in February from a year earlier. In February, Fiat curtailed its production by about 40,000 cars.
2/20/1991	Fiat Truck Unit To Lay Off 3,000	The truck division of Fiat S.p.A., Iveco, announced plans to lay off nearly 3,000 workers for three years, while seeking ways to reduce its work force permanently. A spokesman for Fiat, Italy's largest private employer, said 2,983 workers would receive state unemployment benefits under the plan. Union leaders said they would ask the labor minister to negotiate an accord. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the workers might eventually find jobs in other Fiat companies. Others would be asked to take early retirement. He said falling revenue and lower European demand for trucks were behind the need to cut the work force.
1/11/1991	Fiat Plans 65,000 Weeklong Layoffs	Fiat S.p.A. said it planned to lay off 65,000 workers for a week next month because of the sluggish demand for automobiles. Paolo Gasca, the head of industrial relations for the company, said the temporary reduction that will begin on Feb. 11 will cut back production by 40,000 cars. The affected workers, who will receive more than 80 percent of the regular salary from a national fund, represent about a third of Fiat's total labor force. Fiat, owned by the Agnelli family, resorted to temporary layoffs of about 70,000 workers in November because of slack demand.
1/4/1991	Fiat Truck Deal	The truck unit of Fiat S.p.A. took control of 60 percent of Spain's state-held Enasa truck maker, sealing an agreement reached last September. The unit, Iveco S.p.A., Europe's second-largest truck maker, paid 1.2 billion pesetas, or about $10.2 million, for the stake in Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A., as Enasa is formally known. The venture's eight-member board will have five Iveco members, with the rest going to Instituto Nacional de Industria, Enasa's parent. The Spanish truck maker has 5,500 employees.
12/21/1990	Ford-Fiat Venture	The Ford Motor Company and Fiat S.p.A. of Italy signed agreements to form a company merging their Fiat Geotech and Ford New Holland Inc. tractor units. Fiat will own 80 percent of the company, while Ford will receive an undisclosed cash payment and retain 20 percent. The Fiat Geotech and Ford New Holland brand names will continue to be used. The new company's headquarters will be in London. Fiat Geotech has more than 13,000 employees worldwide, while Ford New Holland has about 18,000 workers around the world.
11/29/1990	Fiat, Seeing Recovery, To Build 2 New Plants	Looking ahead to a recovery in world markets in 1993 and beyond, the Italian automotive giant, Fiat S.p.A., said today that it would build two production plants in southern Italy.

11/7/1986	FIAT BESTS FORD IN BID FOR ALFA	Italy's largest privately held corporation, Fiat S.p.A, won the battle for control of Alfa Romeo S.p.A. today, defeating a bid from the Ford Motor Company.

10/24/1986	ALFA ROMEO FIGHT INTENSIFIES	Despite the Ford Motor Company's size and international prowess, Fiat S.p.A. seems to be enjoying a distinct home field advantage in the contest to determine which of them takes over Alfa Romeo S.p.A., the state's ailing auto maker. The contest began early this month, when Ford announced that it had offered to link up with Alfa. Fiat said it would respond with a counteroffer, which it is expected to formally announce Friday.
10/2/1986	FIAT VOWS COUNTEROFFER	The Ford Motor Company announced today that it had offered to link up with Alfa-Romeo, Italy's state-owned car maker, presumably by acquiring a substantial interest.

9/30/1986	SYNDICATE IN FIAT SALE FACES LOSS	Investment bankers participating in one of the largest offerings of equity securities ever undertaken in the world's capital markets said yesterday they expect their underwriting syndicate to suffer losses of between $100 million to $200 million on the deal. The offering is of $2.1 billion worth of shares in Fiat S.p.A. They are part of the stake in the Italian automobile maker sold by Libya last week and purchased by the Agnelli family and the underwriting group. Blaming each other for what could turn out to be one of the worst underwriting losses ever seen in the Euromarkets are Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Ltd., the lead underwriter of the group, and a number of its syndicate members. The deal was expected to test the emerging market for Euroequities - securities sold outside a company's home market.
9/28/1986	Libya Sells Its Stake in Fiat	Libya's partial ownership of the multinational conglomerate Fiat S.p.A has been an embarrassment to the company, as well as a political thorn in Italy's side.

9/26/1986	FIAT'S NOVEL GLOBAL OFFERING	When the Agnelli family and an investment bank underwriting syndicate bought back Libya's stake in Fiat, the Italian auto maker, for $3.15 billion on Tuesday, they set in motion a securities offering that breaks new ground in the emergence of a global market for corporate equities. The Agnelli family, which is the leading shareholder in Fiat, will retain roughly one-third of the stake, but the remaining two-thirds will be resold to investors. That reoffering is the largest secondary placement ever undertaken in the fast-growing Euroequities market, where stock in companies is sold outside their home countries. In an intricate and novel distribution plan, leading underwriters from all major money centers of the world are now reaching investors to wrap up placement of the $2.1 billion worth of securities by Tuesday.
9/24/1986	LIBYA'S FIAT STAKE SOLD FOR $3 BILLION	Libya has sold all of its 14 percent share in Fiat S.p.A. for about $3 billion, the automobile maker said today. The sale frees Italy's largest private company of a partner that proved an embarrassment to it and the Italian Government. The sale also brought Libya more than seven times the $400 million it paid for its share of Fiat in 1976. At that time the giant enterprise was suffering from severe losses and labor problems. After diversifying its operations, Fiat completed a startling financial turnaround in 1982.
