2011-05-21	How to Claim Airfare Credit	Most everyone has had the experience of searching carefully for the best airfare and booking a flight, only to see the ticket price later drop. (With fuel prices rising, that might not be happening as often, but it still occurs.) Airlines typically offer credits or vouchers for the difference in price when that happens, although most of them mute the benefit by imposing a hefty change fee when you try to claim the credit. But a lot of consumers don't realize they may be eligible for a credit, or don't act fast enough to claim it. The flier first has to know the fare has dropped, and then must call the airline in time to request the credit before the price goes up again. For that reason, a lot of travelers don't take advantage of the credit. A recent survey by MasterCard found that 71 percent of people searching for airfares weren't aware of the availability of such credits and that 10 percent knew they existed but didn't know how to take advantage of them.

And when you open a new credit card, your credit score can suffer, too.

2006-04-09	No Fusion Here: It's Strictly Thai	ABOUT 10 years ago there was a flurry of Thai restaurants opening in Connecticut, but this was soon eclipsed by fusion cooking -- with the occasional heavy helping of Thai. Now, Thai cuisine itself seems to be back. This is evident at the new Lotus Thai Restaurant and Bar in Stratford.
2006-04-02	From Subtle to Bold, Delectably French	I ORDERED the raw oysters appetizer at the French Corner here anticipating a fresh taste and the usual horseradish chaser. As soon as the platter arrived -- oysters poised on a mound of ice, with seaweed beautifully ribboned around their wavy shells -- I knew I was going to get much more. Chilled and sweet, the oysters had a briny taste offset by a musky truffle gelée. With each bite, I was sampling the sea and the earth at once.
2006-03-26	Italian Mainstays With Unexpected Touches	THE Connecticut diner's appetite for Italian food is seemingly insatiable. Counting on this is Cantina Sforza, a recent arrival on the Post Road in Westport near the Norwalk line. Its older sibling, Via Sforza, is a few blocks southwest on the same road in Norwalk. The specialty at this attractive newcomer is northern Italian fare and the kitchen, on my visits, proved itself capable of dishing up any number of tantalizing examples. While some restaurants list every ingredient in a dish to ''romanticize'' it, Cantina Sforza takes another direction.
2006-03-21	Ring Up My Bill, Please; Mobile Payment Via Cellphone	Roy Peek had about $40, three credit cards and a debit card in his wallet. But to pay for a Coke and a slice of pizza here at a Philips Arena concession stand, he whipped out his cellphone. ''With this, I don't have to hurry, I don't have to stop at an A.T.M.,'' said Mr. Peek, shortly after tapping the device against a coaster-size terminal that flashed lights and beeped as it billed his credit card account.
2006-03-12	The Old Haunt	WHEN Robert and Jean Duda first laid eyes on Bell's Mansion five years ago, about all it had left were a grand history and a liquor license. Built when Andrew Jackson was president, owned for more than a century by wealthy industrialists, the old mansion had long since fallen on bad times. By 2001 it had been empty for two decades -- a listing pile of bricks and rotting shingles overrun by raccoons, squirrels and if you believe the local legend, the ghosts of its former owners, the Bells and the Salmons. A plan by a more recent owner to turn it into an inn -- hence the liquor license -- had collapsed, along with much of the roof.
2006-03-12	Japanese Without All the Fusion	IN an age when every new Asian restaurant seems to be a fusion of this-and-that, it is refreshing to visit Kobis, a relatively new arrival in Fairfield, which is what it is: Japanese, period. In a way, Kobis sells itself short. It calls itself a Japanese steakhouse, but in addition to the large hibachi room with the built-in grills and shared tables (where Japanese chefs wield their knives dramatically), there is a second dining room on several levels, with a separate tatami room.
2006-03-08	Oscar Night Awards For the Entr'Actes	WHAT does it say for the vaunted creative abilities of Madison Avenue that the best commercials during the Academy Awards broadcast on ABC were not really commercials? The brightest spots in the Hollywood firmament on Sunday night were the make-believe ''attack ads'' introduced by the program's host, Jon Stewart, as part of a facetious demonstration of what it would be like if Oscar nominees used negative campaigns the way political candidates do.
2006-03-08	Citigroup Blocks Cards In 3 Nations After Breach	Citigroup said yesterday that it was blocking transactions on bank cards used in three countries, the latest sign of a card system breach that has prompted a number of banks to reissue thousands of debit cards. Citigroup said it halted such transactions in Canada, Britain and Russia after detecting an unspecified number of fraudulent cash withdrawals from automated teller machines last month. Other big banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual, have taken similar steps, they said.
2006-03-04	Tax Bills And Plastic Don't Mix	If you find every excuse to use a credit card to reap reward points, it might be very tempting to use it to pay a big tax bill. You wouldn't be alone. Last year, 1.57 million people paid their taxes by credit card, 54 percent more than the year before, the Internal Revenue Service said. As many as a third of them did it just to accumulate points, says Official Payments, one of two companies that process the credit card transactions for the government.
2006-03-01	$25 AND UNDER; Grandma's Sauerbraten and Shelves of Steins	I PASSED few pedestrians on the 30-minute walk from the Staten Island ferry to Nürnberger Bierhaus, a five-month-old German restaurant in the largely residential area of West Brighton. (It's faster to take an S46 or S96 bus or a cab from the ferry, or, as the cab drivers call it, the boat.)
2006-02-26	With a Little Help From a Friend	WHEN Tenero, which calls itself a ''ristorante Italiano,'' opened in South Norwalk about two years ago, it was pleasant but uneven, with some super dishes and others in need of work. But recently I heard that the management was rejiggering its menu and had enlisted the help of Bill Taibe, the chef and an owner at Relish several blocks away. As an admirer of Mr. Taibe's cooking style, I felt this was worth checking into. What a pleasant surprise. In several visits, I was increasingly impressed by Tenero's transformation from a restaurant worthy of a ''good'' rating into a ''very good'' one, bordering on ''excellent.'' Everything that the kitchen tackled worked, and the presentations were as inviting as the food was delicious.
2006-02-26	Small Is Beautiful	THE name of this five-month-old restaurant really ought to be Tough Act to Follow. It is called Lorena's, but food and wine enthusiasts will remember it as Jocelyne's -- the sweet, tiny, comforting jewel box of a place that held down its little corner of downtown Maplewood (and their hearts) from 1998 until it abruptly closed last year. In truth, the similarities are almost eerie. Like its predecessor, Lorena's serves high-end French food with New American accents. The chefs -- Mitchell Altholz of Jocelyne's, Humberto Campos Jr. of Lorena's -- grew up in Edison. Each named his restaurant after his significant other. Each woman set aside her own career (Jocelyne Altholz was a professor, Lorena Perez an intensive-care nurse) to become the restaurant's gracious, assured, everywhere-at-once manager.
2006-02-21	Boarding a PATH Train With Just a Wave	Commuters are about to move one step closer to using a single card to pay fares on transit systems throughout the region. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has started distributing a card called SmartLink that allows travelers to enter the PATH train system with a wave of the wallet. Pads built into turnstiles in all PATH stations can read the cards, which have computer chips embedded in them, as they pass by.
2006-02-21	My Concierge Will Call Your Concierge	WHEN you call Chez Escargot to plead for a reservation, do they laugh and say they have no table for you? Are you down in the dumps because an old college pal said his people would get in touch with your people, and you had to admit you didn't have any people? Does it sometimes feel as if the whole world is a V.I.P. list and your name is not on it?
2006-02-12	At Risk: Chapter 6: The D.A.'s Getaway	Monique stands in the middle of the examination room, the white blanket wrapped around her. ''Get us out of here,'' she says to Win.
2006-02-12	X-Factors	RESTAURANT X is undoubtedly the best-loved restaurant in Rockland County, and it's easy to see why. It begins with the pair of large white ducks (first names unknown; let's call them Mr. and Mrs.) that waddle over from a nearby pond to greet you at the entrance. From there on, the place simply wraps its arms around you. There's the spacious, companionable bar, with its dark wood and glistening ranks of high-end whiskeys and vodkas. (During the recent holiday season it was decked with fragrant pine garlands.) There's the huge central fireplace, casting warmth and cheer in all directions.
2006-02-12	A Heaping Helping of Nostalgia	RESTAURANT X is undoubtedly the best-loved restaurant in Rockland County, and it's easy to see why.

2006-02-08	To Make the Card Special, Try the Warm and Familiar	FOR 20 years, Visa USA said its credit cards were ''everywhere you want to be.'' But the image of the cards is so fleeting in Visa's new campaign, its first attempt to refashion itself since 1986, that you will need to set your TiVo in slow motion to see them. That was by design. The new campaign and slogan, Life Takes Visa, aims to elevate the card company from just a purveyor of plain-vanilla plastic. Instead, Visa's newly hired agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day in Playa del Rey, near Los Angeles, hopes to rebrand the company as the payment partner in people's lives.
2006-02-04	Planning a Trip With Peace of Mind in Mind	WHEN planning a vacation, I think of sun, sea, great dinners and fascinating sights. Call me crazy, but the last thing I want to think about is the possibility of death, dismemberment, sickness, terrorism or natural disasters.
2006-02-01	$25 AND UNDER; Hear the Laughter, Pass the Satays	THE dining room at Minangasli is not much to look at. It is spartan but spic and span; it does what it needs to and not much more. It turns out, though, that interior decoration is not the only way to give a dining room personality and warmth. Over a lunch there one Saturday I noticed the sound of laughter and happy chatter spilling out of the open kitchen and into the dining room. The staff was laughing and cooking and laughing some more. A server was attentive and unobtrusive. The combination was warming and welcoming and took my attention off the government-mandated warning tags on the blinds.
2006-02-01	Two Approaches to Selling Secure Transactions	VISA and MasterCard use similar strategies to fight identity theft and fraud, but the companies have come up with two vastly different approaches to market their security efforts. Visa USA has taken its message to consumers, sending out a stream of television and magazine ads highlighting the steps it takes when account data is missing.
2006-01-31	A Test at 25 Stations: Subway Riding Without the Swiping	It is too early to predict the demise of the MetroCard, but yesterday the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced what could be a step in that direction: an experiment letting riders enter the subway by tapping or waving a credit card or payment tag. The six-month trial, scheduled to start this spring, could lend momentum to efforts toward a ''smart card'' valid on subways, buses and commuter trains throughout the region. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has championed that concept, but the transportation authority has been reluctant to embrace it.
2006-01-29	Of a Different Color	ON an anonymous, miscellaneous stretch of Bloomfield Avenue that still isn't quite ready for its close-up, Blu is easy to miss. And even when we found it, we felt a little lost. Blu, a tiny new restaurant in a narrow storefront that used to be Mango's Reggae Cafe, has the dim, retro-noir look of an early-60's basement rec room. On a ferocious night in early winter, its blue three-letter sign, etched into frosted glass in the front window, was wreathed in vapor. The place looked faintly, pleasurably disreputable, as if we'd been transported from the suburbs to some shady deserted neighborhood under the Brooklyn Bridge.
2006-01-18	A February in Overdrive: Super Bowl and Olympics	BRACE yourselves, a billion-dollar advertising blitz is coming to a TV set near you. Arriving first, on Feb. 5, are the commercials on ABC during the Super Bowl, traditionally the biggest day of the year for Madison Avenue. Then, five days later, come the commercials during the NBC coverage of the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, which is to run through Feb. 26. Marketers in competitive categories like automobiles, credit cards, fast food and telecommunications will spend an estimated $1.1 billion on thousands of commercials during those two sports events.
2006-01-16	Their Ads Here; Marketers Want to Appear On the Small Screen	"Forget the 30-second spot on a 50-inch high-definition TV. How about a three-second message on the tiniest of screens? Television-style advertising is coming to a mobile phone near you. It is part of a broader push by marketers to create a new generation of ''up close and personal"" ads by delivering video, audio, banner displays and text clips over a device carried by most American adults."
2006-01-15	Impressionist Palate	THE voice on the answering machine is British. The name on the plate-glass window is French. The chef and owner is Egyptian. The cuisine well, it's not so easy to place. Not that it would be wrong to call the five-month-old Cafe Monet a French restaurant. After all, the menu offers plats du jour (including cassoulet and coq au vin), not to mention roast poussin and frisée aux lardons. But then you encounter an appetizer like wild mushroom strudel, and you're whisked off to some transnational realm, a mythical country where language and ethnicity have ceased to matter.
2006-01-12	Credit Card Rivals to Unite In Data Protection Effort	Two longtime rivals in the credit card business are working together to create a private group that would set new industrywide security standards as early as the middle of this year, a MasterCard executive said yesterday. Security officials from Visa USA and MasterCard International began quietly meeting early last year to discuss the best way to improve data security. But the high-profile disclosure of a security breach at CardSystems Solutions, a tiny payment processor that left 40 million cardholder accounts exposed to fraud, has given the effort a new push.
2006-01-12	BUSINESS DIGEST	Guidant Accepts Revised Takeover Offer After Johnson & Johnson Raises Price The battle for control of the Guidant Corporation took a new turn as Johnson & Johnson raised its bid to $23.2 billion and reached a new agreement with Guidant, pre-empting an offer from Boston Scientific. [Page C1.] Trade Surplus Revives Concern on China's Currency China said its trade surplus with the rest of the world had tripled in 2005 to a record $102 billion, a figure that could reignite global trade frictions and step up pressure on the government to allow its currency to appreciate.

2006-01-07	Redskins Try to Become the Messenger	Tuesday was a joyous day for the denizens of Redskins Nation. Fresh off making the playoffs for the first time in six seasons, the Washington Redskins removed one of the most attractive head-coaching candidates from a torrid market by re-signing Gregg Williams, the team's defensive coordinator and assistant head coach, to a lavish three-year extension. But the good cheer did not spread to everyone. The Redskins informed the news media that Williams, with a playoff game against Tampa Bay on Saturday, did not want to do any interviews. Yet later that afternoon, Williams sat for a video chat with Redskins.com TV, which streamed it live on the team's Web site. Immediately after, the NBC affiliate in Washington landed the only other Williams interview. The station's sports director is George Michael, who also serves as host of the ''The Redskins Report'' and ''The Joe Gibbs Show'' and as the executive producer of ''Redskins Game Plan.''
2006-01-04	Parent Weighs Abandoning Credit Card Processing Unit	THE recent consolidation among issuers of credit cards has produced winners and losers. First Data might be in the latter camp. One of the two major processors of credit card accounts for banks, First Data has in recent years lost some prominent customers to its chief rival, Total System Services.
2006-01-01	Fish That Isn't Post-Holiday Penance	WITH the indulgence of December recalled only on the waistline, many diners see the first months of the year as a time to abstain from pleasures of the table. Low-carb or low-fat regimens appeal after the season of surfeit, and some holiday celebrants assume that regaining control means dining at home. But seafood restaurants like Eastchester Fish Gourmet can satisfy post-holiday culinary needs with diet-friendly fresh fish. This kitchen lacked some of the polish and care it took with preparations a few years ago, but nothing was amiss with a carpaccio of salmon and tuna, the translucent squares of pale tuna and pink salmon arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Crisp pear, ginger and lime cut deliciously the butteriness of the fish. Perched on a bed of greens and called simply grilled shrimp salad, this item was far removed from the familiar deli item of the same name. Here, a bed of greens made up the salad crowned with five large shrimp -- crisp and rich from a light charring on the grill.
2006-01-01	What Are You Lookin' At?	WHAT does it take to get Americans riled about invasions of privacy? Every week seems to bring reports of a new breach of the computer networks that contain our most intimate personal information. Scores of companies -- including Bank of America, MasterCard, ChoicePoint and Marriott International -- have admitted to security lapses that exposed millions of people's financial information to potential abuse by identity thieves. For the most part, however, Americans have reacted with a collective shrug, many privacy experts said.
2006-01-01	Why Not, Indeed	IF ''A'' is for attitude, it's a grade that Bernard Vard's little bistro has richly earned. Not as in cheeky or patronizing, but as in friendly, honest and unassuming to a fault. The other day, I asked Mr. Vard about his restaurant's mouthful of a name, with its internal punctuation and shifting parts of speech. He explained that ''Pourquoi Pas?'' -- meaning ''Why not?'' of course, and carried over from his previous venture, in Ho Ho Kus -- was a name he'd borrowed decades ago from an inn in the south of France. A modest workingman, the son of an Auvergne butcher, he never wanted to be part of a ''Chez Bernard.''
2005-12-31	Gift Horses To Consider: Credit Cards That Reward	If it seems like you are getting a lot of credit card solicitations, you are. Credit card companies sent out about six billion letters in the last year. But if you opened any, you may have noticed a dwindling number of zero-percent balance-transfer offers and more pitches for cash-back reward cards. Half of them are for reward cards.
2005-12-24	BUSINESS BRIEFS	HSBC to Join With Former Rival In Offering American Express Cards The British banking company HSBC Holdings said yesterday that it would offer American Express cards in the United States starting in the middle of next year, the latest bank to strike a marketing alliance with its one-time rival. Financial terms of the arrangement were not disclosed, though the impact of the new cards was expected to be negligible for HSBC in the near term. HSBC benefits by ridding itself of a potentially expensive lawsuit. American Express agreed to dismiss HSBC from its antitrust litigation against Visa, MasterCard and a number of major American banks. With HSBC, American Express now has signed up six banks in the United States. (REUTERS) Wyeth to Pay $416.5 Million for Rights to Drug Wyeth, the drug maker, said yesterday that it had agreed to pay as much as $416.5 million to Progenics Pharmaceuticals for rights to an experimental treatment for constipation, bowel dysfunction and other side effects caused by the use of opioid drugs, used to combat pain. Under the deal, Wyeth will receive worldwide rights to methylnaltrexone, while Progenics will retain an option to promote the product in the United States. Wyeth said the deal included an upfront payment of $60 million with as much as an additional $356.5 million payable on achieving certain goals. Opioids can cause debilitating side effects, like constipation, urinary retention and severe itching. The companies said methylnaltrexone is intended to block receptors that foster these side effects. (REUTERS) Sovereign Sues to Block Shareholder From Ousting Board Sovereign Bancorp filed a federal lawsuit yesterday seeking to block its largest shareholder from ousting its board. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, claimed that a proposal by Relational Investors, based in San Diego, to seek a shareholder vote to remove the board was not permitted under Pennsylvania law. Relational plans to submit a proposal at next year's annual meeting to replace the five other Sovereign directors. Relational, which owns about 8 percent of Sovereign's shares, is opposed to Sovereign's plan to sell an ownership stake to Banco Santander Central Hispano, Spain's biggest bank. Sovereign is based in Philadelphia. (AP) United Bidding for Assets of Regional Carrier United Airlines has submitted a bid to buy an unspecified part of the assets of FLYi Inc., a former United regional carrier whose attempt to convert itself into the discount airline Independence Air ended in failure last month. United said yesterday that it had asked a federal bankruptcy judge in Chicago to authorize it to purchase FLYi assets at an auction that could occur as early as Jan. 3. United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, did not disclose details of the bid, which was filed under seal in the bankruptcy court. After United filed for bankruptcy in 2002, it severed its ties to Atlantic Coast Airlines, which renamed itself FLYi and started a stand-alone airline called Independence Air. FLYi stayed aloft for scarcely a year. In November, the company sought Chapter 11 protection, listing debts of $489 million. (DOW JONES/AP) Texas A&M President Named Lead Director at Fidelity The former director of central intelligence, Robert M. Gates, will become the lead independent director of the board that oversees Fidelity Investments' hundreds of mutual funds, the firm said yesterday. Mr. Gates, left, who is president of Texas A&M University, and has been a Fidelity fund director since 1997, will take over in January as lead independent director from Marvin L. Mann, who reached the mandatory retirement age. The board is made up of outsiders who have no direct ties to the privately held, Boston-based fund company and Fidelity executives. Mr. Gates will lead the outsider directors while the Fidelity chairman and chief executive, Edward C. Johnson III, will remain chairman of the entire board. (REUTERS) ABN Amro Says Missing Mortgage Data Is Found A missing computer tape containing personal data on roughly two million residential mortgage customers has been found and returned to a Chicago data processing center. The tape's owner, ABN Amro, said it had notified law enforcement and regulatory agencies that the tape had been recovered. The tape was inside a large envelope en route to a credit facility in Texas when it was lost a month ago. Data on the tape included residential mortgage customer names, their Social Security numbers, payment histories and account information. Thomas M. Goldstein, chief executive of ABN Amro Mortgage Group, said it did not appear that the tape was compromised. (AP) BancorpSouth Says Some Card Data Is Compromised BancorpSouth, which has 271 branches in the Southern United States, said yesterday that some private debit card information for 6,500 customers had been compromised. The bank, based in Tupelo, Miss., said in a statement that customers had so far reported ''very little fraud'' since it notified them of the problem on Dec. 16. The company said it was informed of the potential breach of information by MasterCard International and had reissued debit cards to all customers that might have been affected. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Barley Products Can Claim Health Benefits, F.D.A. Rules Cereals, breads and other products containing whole or milled barley grain can now claim to reduce the risk of heart disease, federal health officials said yesterday. The Food and Drug Administration's ruling allows companies immediately to begin advertising the benefit on their product packages, which many food makers hope will help increase consumer sales. ''Consumers can expect to see whole barley and dry milled barley products such as flakes, grits, flour, meal, and barley meal bearing the health claim,'' the F.D.A. said. To qualify, barley-containing foods must provide at least 0.75 gram of soluble fiber per serving, the agency said. About 13 million Americans are diagnosed with coronary heart disease, which can restrict blood flow and lead to chest pain and heart attacks, according to the American Heart Association. (REUTERS)
2005-12-11	Newly Bankrupt Raking In Piles Of Credit Offers	As one of more than two million Americans who rushed to a courthouse this year to file for bankruptcy before a tough new law took effect, Laura Fogle is glad for her chance at a fresh start. A nurse and single mother of two, she blames her use of credit cards after cancer surgery for falling into deep debt. Ms. Fogle is broke, and may not seem to be the kind of person to whom banks would want to offer credit cards. But she said she had no sooner filed for bankruptcy, and sworn off plastic, than she was hit with a flurry of solicitations from major banks.
2005-12-04	Your Table Awaits	YES, Table 8 is the restaurant's name. But it is also, literally, the name of a table -- and of a state of mind. Let Demetri Malki, the founder, explain.

It takes only a few seconds, and it saves Ms. Dubé a trip to the bank to deposit a check or a fistful of cash. Plus, her clients like it. ''They're just surprised -- they're like, 'Wow, you're a techno-wizard,' '' she said.
2005-11-20	Italian Favorites With an Asian Touch	WHEN I first walked into Marisa's Ristorante in Trumbull, I thought, ''Uh-oh, another oversize Italian restaurant with an oversize menu and ordinary food.'' Connecticut is full of places like that. But I Marisa's is a pleasant surprise. The restaurant is large, its space divided into three dining rooms. Two were packed early on my first visit, on a Saturday night, and stayed busy throughout the evening. The third was unused, but, our waitress said, was available for overflow.

Charge It	Starting Monday, 200 parking meters in New York City will accept credit and debit cards in a six-month pilot program that could presage an era of cashless parking.

2005-11-13	Putting on the Blintz	THIS is Tania's second appearance in the New Jersey section. Nine years ago, a brief review in the Quick Bite column spoke in awestruck tones about the restaurant's cold borscht: ''fluorescent refreshingly tangy criminally cheap.'' Those words are as apt today as they were in 1996. There were only two things wrong with the review: the words ''quick'' and ''bite.'' A meal at Tania's, a Polish institution well into its second decade, is anything but.

The decision effectively ends the joint-marketing agreement that for the last six years has allowed MBNA to solicit Wachovia customers for credit card business. MBNA agreed to be acquired for $35 billion by Bank of America in June, after Wachovia passed on a deal.
2005-11-02	$25 AND UNDER; Japanese Home Cooking, Full of Surprises	CURRY ROW is well on its way to becoming a memory. East Sixth Street between First and Second Avenues, once a unified front of mostly undistinguished Bangladeshi and Indian restaurants, now serves up Peruvian, Cajun, Italian-American, Ethiopian and two kinds of Japanese restaurants. Only 11 of the 19 restaurants there serve Subcontinental cuisine.
2005-10-30	The Secret Is Out	SEVEN months old and humming with word-of-mouth traffic, Segreto has a sophisticated bill of fare and prices to match. But it also has a Little Italy swagger that becomes it well, even in this high-toned, broad-lawned borough on the East Hill of the Palisades. ''You won't believe the difference,'' our waiter announced on our first visit, when we asked how the restaurant compared with the previous tenant at this address, the pleasant but predictable Jerry's Gourmet Osteria (reviewed here in March 2003). ''The chef is unbelievable.''
2005-10-23	Italian in Name, but Eclectic in Scope	I'VE lost count of the number of Italian restaurants in Connecticut with variations of the word Tuscany in their names. And why not? Given Tuscany's rich, earthy, irresistible food; fresh natural ingredients; beautiful terrain, and cultural treasures, it seems a compelling name for a northern Italian restaurant. Tuscano, in the center of Danbury, is the latest example. The site is familiar; it used to be the home of Mimi's and at least one other restaurant, and even the interior seems little changed, with dark wood wainscoting, columns, arches and chairs. Posters of Italy now line the ocher walls.
2005-10-17	Card Center Hit by Thieves Agrees to Sale	A biometrics payment company has stepped in to buy the assets of CardSystems Solutions, the same day an offer was withdrawn for CardSystems, the credit card processor at the center of this year's biggest data compromise. The biometrics payment company, Pay By Touch, which hopes that consumers will swipe fingers at retail stores instead of cards, said on Saturday that it was buying substantially all of CardSystems' assets to gain access to its 120,000 merchants.
2005-10-16	Rose Petals?	JAMES GEORGE SARKAR, the 27-year-old chef and owner of the sensational new restaurant called Venue, has grown all too accustomed to the Stare. Prospective customers stop at his front window and scan the menu, he told me by phone the other day, ''and make a dumbfounded face and turn and walk away.'' Their eyes would grow even wider if they ventured inside. Passing through two sets of heavy frosted-glass doors, they would find themselves in a spare but stunning two-story space, with bare blond wood floors, a dozen or so tables laid in austere blacks and whites, side walls painted shades of putty and mango, and a back wall lighted in constantly shifting neon-tinged pastels.
2005-10-06	Visa Chief Proposes Security Agency for Credit Card Industry	Visa USA's new chief executive has proposed creating a private standard-setting agency for the entire credit card industry that would certify that banks and merchants had met certain guidelines but would have little power to enforce them. ''We're exploring a plan to encourage all stakeholders in the payment chain to help create an objective, stand-alone entity to manage data security issues for the entire industry,'' the chief executive, John Philip Coghlan, said in his first public remarks since taking the top job in July. He was speaking at a Visa-sponsored data security conference here that brought together managers from the member banks and credit unions, payment processors and Capitol Hill staff members.
2005-10-06	BUSINESS DIGEST	Increase in Fuel Costs Causes Airlines And Shipping Companies to Raise Prices Airlines and shippers said they were increasing fares and cutting routes in response to the rising cost of fuel, brought on by the slow recovery of refineries along the Gulf Coast. [Page C1.] The Port of New Orleans is perhaps the prime example of the conundrum that the city faces as it seeks to restart its economic engines. The city needs the port to begin generating revenue and jobs. But the port cannot get back on its feet until many of its workers return. And that is not possible until city services are restored and housing built or rebuilt. [C1.] Stocks Fall on Signs of Economic Slowdown Stocks had their broadest decline in months, tumbling on evidence of slowing growth in service industries after hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Standard & Poor's 500 lost 18.08 points, to 1196.39; it is down 1.3 percent this year. The Nasdaq composite index retreated 36.34 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,103.02. Both had their biggest one-day drop in almost six months. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 123.75, or 1.2 percent, to 10,317.36. [C11.] New Consumer Choices Challenge Supermarkets Faced with a seemingly endless array of food shopping choices, consumers are increasingly shunning the neighborhood supermarket and going to Wal-Mart, Costco or other discounters for lower prices or to places like Whole Foods and Wild Oats for specialized quality and service. [C1.] Microsoft Introduces Games for New Xbox Console Trying to take the lead in the race to dominate the next generation of video game systems, Microsoft has unveiled a broad range of games that it hopes will propel millions of consumers to buy its Xbox 360 console.

[C3.] Video Producers Seek Exposure on the Web Video delivered over the Internet, which has been embraced by media and Internet giants like Viacom and Yahoo, is shaping up as a way for smaller producers to reach an audience without having to cut deals with movie studios and the big networks that are the traditional gatekeepers of television. [C1.] Viacom Explains Details on Coming Split Viacom, which is planning to split into two companies next year, named Shari Redstone, left, as nonexecutive vice chairwoman of both units. That company also said that investors would receive half a share in each new business for every Viacom share. The boards of the new Viacom and the CBS Corporation will share three other common directors, including Ms. Redstone's father, Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman, Viacom said.

2005-10-06	Taking On Credit Card Fees, With Allies	Michael Schumann was frustrated with escalating credit card costs at his furniture stores and, worse yet, fed up by the financial losses he was forced to absorb when customers returned purchases. ''The percentage we have to pay to credit card companies has been climbing over the past few years,'' said Mr. Schumann, co-owner of Traditions Classic Home Furnishings, which has stores in Minnesota and Naples, Fla. ''If you buy a sofa, I may pay $20 to $40 in fees, because it's typically 2 percent. But if the customer returns the sofa, we don't get the fees back.''
2005-10-05	Baby Steps on a Road of Good Intentions	THERE is much to learn from dining out in New York these days, and the latest lesson is a revised understanding of the proverb ''youth must be served.'' You thought it was a commentary on the privileges and demands of being young, on the tyranny of youthful impulses? Think again. It's menu advice, cooking instructions. It must be, because chefs all around the city are treating it that way.
2005-10-02	What's in a Name?	FORTUNATELY, food reviews are not spelling bees. Otherwise Copeland would have been eliminated twice, and this is a restaurant on the way up. It occupies a substantial corner of what is now the Westin Governor Morris, a landmark red-brick hotel that was originally named not for any governor but for Gouverneur Morris, the 18th-century New York lawmaker credited with writing the phrase ''We the people'' into the Constitution. (Morristown is named for one of his ancestors.)

2005-09-23	CyberSource to Bid for Credit Card Processor	The CyberSource Corporation, a payment processor for online merchants, said yesterday that it was planning to make an offer today for the assets of CardSystems Solutions, the small credit card processor where a data breach placed the personal account information of more than 40 million accounts at risk for fraud. Terms of the offer have not yet been disclosed and will be subject to CardSystem's acceptance. But Bruce Frymire, a CyberSource spokesman, said the company hoped to proceed with its due diligence so that the transaction could be completed by the end of the year.
2005-09-14	$25 AND UNDER; Come In, Neighbor, and Have a Surprise	A SILVER-HAIRED man struck up a conversation with a tall, tan woman a few stools down the bar from him at Bliss, a new-American bistro in Sunnyside, Queens. ''Come here often?'' he said, then bit into his short ribs.
2005-09-01	MasterCard Pursuing Plan To Offer Shares to Public	MasterCard Inc., the world's second-largest credit card brand, announced plans yesterday to pursue an initial public offering that could value the company at more than $10 billion. By going public, MasterCard can raise capital to lead a stronger charge against Visa International, its larger rival. But the move could also be an effort to try to insulate the banks that issue its debit and credit cards as lawsuits against MasterCard mount, analysts said.
2005-09-01	Better Late Than Never To Fix Latino Promotion	Major League Baseball could have done far better in its attempt to honor the greatest Hispanic ballplayers than its flawed Latino Legends promotion. It makes sense to celebrate baseball's Latino influence and provide a history lesson to fans of every ethnicity, but M.L.B.'s effort has faltered in three areas.
2005-09-01	BUSINESS DIGEST	Prices Surge and Spot Shortages Appear As Hurricane's Effects Reach Gas Pumps Days after Hurricane Katrina dealt a devastating blow to the nation's largest energy hub, the worst-case possibility was quickly becoming a reality: gasoline prices surging well above $3 a gallon, consumer complaints of price gouging and service stations in a handful of locations running out of gas. The White House said it would release emergency oil stockpiles to meet shortages and would relax environmental standards nationwide. [Page A1.] After one of the worst storms ever to hit the Gulf Coast, large parts of the nation's distribution system had shut down, slowing down imports and exports. One result could be that American consumers will be paying more for everything from coffee and bananas to paint and tires.

The account shift is one of the largest in advertising in recent years. Interpublic has been plagued by financial and operational problems since 2002. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C3.] Hedge Fund Company's Brokerage Arm Draws Attention Over the last two and a half years, Bayou Securities, the brokerage unit of Bayou Group, the Connecticut hedge fund company at the center of a growing investigation, generated $51.5 million in revenue executing trades for its four affiliated hedge funds. Such revenues seem excessive for a small firm like Bayou, hedge fund experts said. [C1.] Stocks Climb After Fed Official Comments on Rates Stocks climbed yesterday, rising after the president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve signaled that the central bank could change its interest rate policy in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Falling oil prices also helped stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.78 points, to 10,481.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.92 points, to 1,220.33, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.33 points, to 2,152.09.

It is the first drug approved for Tercica, a biotechnology company based in Brisbane, Calif. An estimated 6,000 children in this country have the specific condition for which the F.D.A. approved the drug, although some doctors expect it to be more broadly prescribed to children with less severe growth abnormalities.

2005-08-25	A Matter Of (Fading) Trust; Banishing One Payment Processor Was Just the Start for Visa	Inside Visa's operations center is a cool, white room about the size of a football field. There, more than a thousand giant computers, set up like hulking linemen, process cardholder information from across the United States. The servers hum with some 3,000 credit and debit card transactions swiped through its network every second; they will handle more than 35 billion transactions in the next year.
2005-08-21	High Fusion	IN 10 years or so, if we're lucky, the term ''fusion'' will have come to sound hopelessly quaint, at least when it comes to restaurant menus. (Energy production is another matter.) By then, the prodigious skills and bold techniques of Asia's iron chefs should be so thoroughly integrated into American cuisine that they'll be taken for granted. But until that happy day, we'll need places like Aozora to blaze new trails for our taste buds. This 70-seat restaurant, in a narrow storefront on a stretch of Bloomfield Avenue that may come as close as any in the state to deserving the name Restaurant Row, is something of a pioneer. It opened in early 2003, at a time when fusion cooking -- at least the high-style kind inspired by chefs like Nobu Matsuhisa and Jean-Georges Vongerichten -- had attained critical mass in Manhattan but was pretty much an untested hypothesis here.
2005-08-17	Delta Faces a Lowering of Its Debt Rating	Standard & Poor's said yesterday that it might lower the debt rating for Delta Air Lines as shrinking cash holdings and rising fuel costs push the company closer to bankruptcy. ''The airline's already slim chances of avoiding bankruptcy are dwindling rapidly,'' Philip Baggaley, an S.&P. analyst, said in a statement. S.&P. has a CC rating on Delta, which is 10 levels below investment grade.
2005-08-13	Delta Said To Explore Bankruptcy Financing	Delta Air Lines has begun arranging the financing it will need if it seeks bankruptcy protection, something Wall Street analysts, industry executives and finance experts say could happen within weeks, people with direct knowledge of Delta's actions said yesterday. Delta, which is based in Atlanta, is holding discussions with lenders like GE Commercial Finance, which provided it restructuring money last year and could do so again, in or out of bankruptcy, these people and others in the financial community said. A spokesman for GE Commercial declined to comment.
2005-08-10	Delta Air Lines Discloses Additional Financial Problems	Delta Air Lines, struggling to avoid bankruptcy protection, was hit by a fresh crisis yesterday when it delayed a regulatory filing so it could conclude critical talks to reach a deal with a new credit card processing company. Without a deal, Delta would not be able to accept Visa or MasterCard as payment for tickets, which could cost it business. The disclosure by Delta, the third-largest domestic airline behind American and United, came after its shares sank amid new fears that it would have to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
2005-08-07	Europe Zips Lips; U.S. Sells ZIPs	IF the information is not already missing, 2005 might be recorded in the databanks of history as the year of the consumer privacy breach. So far, American companies including financial services giants like Bank of America, Citigroup and MasterCard, and national retailers like DSW shoes and Ralph Lauren Polo, have announced data compromises. All told, the personal information of more than 50 million consumers has been lost, stolen and even sold to thieves.
2005-08-07	Full Moon	STEP inside Lua, and you may be knocked right back out the door by a wave of carnival intensity. This eight-month-old restaurant by the Hudson River, in a corner of Hoboken as crisp and snappy as a new $50 bill, doesn't just vibrate with energy. It pulses. It throbs. Sometimes it roars. Lua -- the concise and lovely name is Portuguese for moon -- is the creation of two canny veterans of the stylish-dining wars: John Avoletta Jr., the owner of City Bistro, on 14th Street, and Ricardo Cardona, a chef whose most recent venture was the high-buzz Latino restaurant DRK in Upper Manhattan. They have a pitch-perfect ear for the Hoboken of the moment, a place where modish young men and women in every permutation of singles, couples and groups can hang out, sip, graze, meet, mingle, preen and even, occasionally, indulge in serious eating.
2005-08-04	Cellphones? Over There, Right Next To the Nachos	Jeanne Yanaro long associated 7-Eleven with Big Gulps and last-minute groceries. But late last year she turned to her local convenience store for a more substantial purchase: a cellular phone. ''It would have been the last place I'd have thought to go for a phone,'' said Ms. Yanaro, a marketing manager who lives in Chelmsford, Mass.
2005-07-31	Earthly Delights	MARRIED with children has many blessings but, between finding and paying a sitter and reluctance to spend time away from the little rascals, we, like many of our friends, rarely go out. And I can't remember the last time we went dancing. So, when my erudite friend smiled at the invitation of the belly dancer wiggling near our dining table and unfurled himself from his chair to shimmy and shake -- and to stuff dollar bills in safe zones of her gloriously glittering costume -- it was clear. We all miss it. At the Oasis Grill, you can have an exotic satisfying dinner and, if you're bold, recapture for a moment the pleasure of music and body.
2005-07-26	Main Street in the Cross Hairs; Nation's 5 Million Retail Stores Prove an Easy Target for Data Thieves	Along a crowded stretch of highway just south of Miami's downtown is a shopping area that might be called the data theft capital of the United States. In the wireless hacker equivalent of a drive-by shooting wave, criminals obtained the cardholder information of tens of thousands of customers at four major stores there, including a DSW Shoes retail outlet that appears to have been the initial source of a chainwide data breach. Recent investigations reveal that the thieves singled out stores with strong wireless signals and weakly protected data. While their exact methods are not known, they could have parked a car outside a store or set up in the local Starbucks, using a laptop computer outfitted with an off-the-shelf wireless receiver. They may have even received help from Web sites listing the geographic coordinates of easy-to-target stores.
2005-07-24	All That Glitters	''NO T-shirt shops, no hot dog stands,'' boasts the Web site of the Black Trumpet's upstairs parent, the Sandpiper Inn. ''Is this the Jersey Shore?'' Well, yes and no. Spring Lake is definitely a special case, and so is this eight-month-old restaurant, on the ground floor of a many-gabled Victorian that was once a Spanish ambassador's summer retreat and is now a splendiferous bed-and-breakfast.
2005-07-22	Lawmakers Examine Credit Card Breaches	Major credit card companies and the payment processor at the center of the country's largest data breach were called to Capitol Hill on Thursday to testify about a security compromise that exposed some 40 million cardholders to fraud. But much of the finger-pointing was directed at two groups that were not there: Cable & Wireless Americas, the defunct security auditor that reported that CardSystems was complying with payment industry rules, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which CardSystems said did not immediately respond when told of the breach.
2005-07-21	Chief of Card Processor Fires Back at Visa	The chief executive of CardSystems Solutions, John M. Perry, fired back at Visa last night, sharply criticizing it for stopping his company from processing its cardholders' transactions on the eve of Congressional hearings into the vulnerability of consumer data. Mr. Perry said he was ''justifiably concerned'' by Visa's decision, in his first public statement since a mid-June disclosure that more than 40 million credit and debit card accounts passing through the processor had been put at risk for fraud.
2005-07-20	American Express to Cut Ties to Processor Involved in Data Breach	American Express said yesterday that it would soon end its relationship with CardSystems Solutions, the small payment processor at the center of perhaps the credit card industry's biggest data breach. MasterCard International, meanwhile, said that it would continue to allow its cardholders' data to be handled by CardSystems provided security was upgraded. ''As of today, we are not aware of any deficiencies in its systems that are incapable of being remediated,'' MasterCard said in a statement.
2005-07-19	Visa to Bar Transactions By Processor	Visa USA said yesterday that it would stop allowing the payment processor CardSystems Solutions to handle its transactions, months after the processor left the records of millions of cardholders at risk for fraud. ''CardSystems has not corrected, and cannot at this point correct, the failure to provide proper data security for those accounts,'' said Tim Murphy, Visa's senior vice president for operations in a memorandum sent to several banks. ''Visa USA has decided that CardSystems should not continue to participate as an agent in the Visa system.''
2005-07-18	From Data Holders, Lots of Reassurance	WHEN Visa USA learned last month that a data breach had put the personal information of millions of its customers at risk for theft, the company's top executives huddled to come up with a plan for responding to the inevitable concerns. A public relations team sought to reassure consumers. Marketing managers looked for a way to address in Visa's advertising its cardholder security fears, which a phone poll showed were at all-time highs. As it turns out, Visa already had a response ready. It simply increased the frequency of existing spots, like those featuring fraud-fighting superheroes and a fireman clad in layers of protective gear.
2005-07-16	7 Big Retail Chains Sue Visa, Saying Its Fees Are a Form of Price Fixing	A series of court rulings over the last few years were intended to encourage banks and credit card companies to compete more vigorously. But some merchants are complaining that they have not reaped the benefits and that consumers are footing the bill. That issue is at the center of a price-fixing lawsuit filed late Thursday against Visa USA and Visa International by seven large grocers and convenience store chains. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, asserts that the fees Visa charges merchants to process credit and debit card transactions are unfairly high.
2005-07-16	Personal Business; Health Care at the Swipe of a Card	The paper-pushing method of paying medical bills, which has long been fairly resistant to the electronic age, is about to be challenged as new payment options like health savings accounts and prepaid medical cards gain wider acceptance in the workplace. Beyond their practical aspects, these products -- and health savings accounts in particular -- represent a philosophical shift toward consumer-directed health care, with people taking a more active role in supervising their medical treatments and benefits.
2005-07-12	Longtime Schwab Executive Is Named Chief of Visa USA	Visa USA named a chief executive yesterday whose experience with credit and debit cards has consisted largely of swiping them at restaurants and stores. The executive, John Philip Coghlan, the former vice chairman of the Charles Schwab Corporation, succeeds Carl F. Pascarella, Visa's longtime chief executive who said last summer that he was planning to depart for a job in investment banking. The selection of Mr. Coghlan comes as Visa and its chief rivals, MasterCard and American Express, have been posting strong profits, a result of a surge in the use of debit cards. At the same time, credit card growth has been sluggish, and relations between card associations and the merchants that connect to their payment networks have soured.
2005-07-10	Split Personality	''LOVE me tender,'' says the man in the uniform and cap, brandishing a fearsome set of knives. He slices an onion and flings it onto the hot steel surface of our table, where it erupts in a fierce hissing cloud. ''Holy smoke!'' he cries. Then he grabs a plastic ketchup dispenser, aims it at one of my companions and squeezes. She gasps and flinches, but all it emits is a shoelace. ''More sake for you!'' he tells her. ''Go home, sleep long time!''
2005-07-08	CardSystems Sets Plan to Comply With Security Standards	CardSystems Solutions, the credit card payment processor at the center of one of the biggest data breaches, said yesterday that it hoped to comply with the industry's security standards by the end of August, at least eight months after data thieves installed software on its computer network to facilitate a break-in. CardSystems disclosed last month that its computer network in Tucson had been compromised, putting the sensitive account information of as many as 40 million cardholders at risk for fraud.
2005-07-01	Bank of America to Buy MBNA, A Prime Issuer of Credit Cards	Seeking to grab a bigger share of consumers' business by becoming a powerhouse in credit cards, the Bank of America Corporation announced plans yesterday to acquire the card giant MBNA for $35 billion in cash and stock. The deal represents a bet by Bank of America that consumer spending will remain robust. This could be a risky assumption if rising interest rates leave consumers feeling financially pressed, causing growth to slow sharply in businesses like home lending and credit cards, which have been particularly profitable for banks in recent years.
2005-06-30	Take a Number	Inside the Tucson data processing center for CardSystems Solutions is a long room where dozens of computers are stacked in neat rows. This is the nerve center for millions of credit and debit card transactions. Its doors are bolted shut; access is restricted. Entry requires swiping a card and punching in a short code. But all that physical security, as described by former employees, did not matter. CardSystems acknowledged this month that its computers had been attacked by thieves, putting the account information of 40 million cardholders around the world at risk.
2005-06-26	Wishful Cooking	''WISH you were here,'' says the woman on the reservation line. It's more than a nice play on the name of this new restaurant. The fact is, she means it. The voice belongs to Melissa Winter. She is the hostess at Wish; her husband, Brett, is the chef. She also came up with the name, which (as you might have guessed) is short for ''my wish.'' The two of them share a palpable determination to make it come true.
2005-06-26	At PartyGaming, Everything's Wild	AS a rule, companies don't often draw attention to business practices that could land their executives in jail. But for PartyGaming PLC, potential illegalities aren't just a secret hidden in its business plan -- they are the centerpiece of its business plan. A giant in the online gambling business, PartyGaming is an often-overlooked megasurvivor from the dot-com crash of the late 1990's. As hundreds of profitless commercial sites disappeared into the digital ether, PartyGaming's popular gambling sites -- like PartyPoker.com -- soared, with revenues and profits growing exponentially year after year.
2005-06-26	Worry. But Don't Stress Out.	THE theft of computer data at an Arizona company that put as many as 40 million credit card accounts at risk for fraud may have been the largest case of stolen consumer information yet. But the incident, which was revealed last week and may have occurred months ago, surely will not be the last. In fact, the theft was only the latest in a series of incidents, not all of which involved criminal activity. Earlier this month, for example, United Parcel Service lost data tapes with personal information on nearly four million customers of Citigroup.
2005-06-25	Personal Business; Teenagers and Their Plastic, the Rites of Passage	Teenagers are a fickle bunch: first they wanted credit cards of their own and now it seems they don't. That is not to say they avoid all plastic. These days, their wallets are full of other cards, including debit cards, which draw money from banking accounts, and a wealth of prepaid cards that store a certain cash value that can be tapped with a swipe of the card.
2005-06-25	Age 80 in Guernsey? Forget About Renting a Car	MOST people may never need to know this, but if you were to rent a car in Morocco or New Caledonia, you better not be 65 or over years old. Or 70 in Egypt, Gibraltar, Kenya, Malta, New Guinea and Tasmania. And if you are that intrepid 80-year-old visiting the Isle of Man or Guernsey, you better take public transportation. That's because in those countries -- unlike the United States -- many rental car companies have upper age limits.
2005-06-25	13 WITH THE C.I.A. SOUGHT BY ITALY IN A KIDNAPPING	An Italian judge has ordered the arrest of 13 officers and operatives of the Central Intelligence Agency on charges that they seized an Egyptian cleric on a Milan street two years ago and flew him to Egypt for questioning, Italian prosecutors and investigators said Friday. The judge, Chiara Nobili of Milan, signed the arrest warrants on Wednesday for 13 C.I.A. operatives who are suspected of seizing an imam named Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, as he walked to his mosque here for noon prayers on Feb. 17, 2003.
2005-06-25	To Catch a Thief	Over the last eight months, there seemed to be at least 140 different men and women living in the same apartment at 2978 Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. Every one of them appeared to have a credit card and an insatiable appetite for jewelry from the glittering collections hawked on ShopNBC, a shopping network based in this suburb of Minneapolis. So it was particularly satisfying for Joan Radtke, the director of credit at ShopNBC, when a postal inspection agent in New York called to say that a 22-year-old man had been arrested Wednesday morning at the Nostrand Avenue address, partly on the basis of information provided by ShopNBC.
2005-06-23	Bank in Utah Says Its Data Was at Risk In Intrusion	A small bank in Utah is the latest company to become entangled in the controversy over a security breach that has put personal data on 40 million cardholders at risk for fraud. The Utah institution, Merrick Bank, began using CardSystems Solutions -- the processor from which the information was stolen -- when it bought a portion of Provident Bank's merchant business in November 2004. Merrick acknowledged yesterday that CardSystems had not complied with Visa and MasterCard's security standards, but would not say when it became aware that the company was not following the rules, or whether the violations occurred under its watch.
2005-06-22	Regulators Start Inquiry In Data Loss	Federal banking regulators said yesterday that they had started an investigation into CardSystems Solutions, the payment processor where a security breach has put millions of American cardholders at risk for fraud. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, an interagency group of the federal banking regulators, said the investigation began last week. Officials are assessing security at CardSystems' operational centers, at the major credit card companies and at any banks that may be involved, the council said. It would not identify the banks contacted in the inquiry.
2005-06-22	$25 AND UNDER; A Trip to the Maine Coast at the Back of a Bar	THERE are plenty of places in the city that work a lobster shack shtick without as much emphasis on the shack as Black Pearl. It doles out lobster rolls and their ilk from a space that's little more than a pass window and stylish lighted-up sign in the back of Julep, an East Village bar. Julep, just north of Houston Street on Avenue A, is no idealized beachside retreat. Nor is it the kind of bar where self-consciously mussed up downtown boys go to drink cheap beer with a smirk and smarmily cue up Skynyrd on the jukebox. Instead, guys with paint-stained clothes and the sort of tan that only comes from working in the sun show up right after work to inhale plates of fried seafood and drink a $2 can of Pabst Blue Ribbon. (There is, it should be noted, Skynyrd on the jukebox.)
2005-06-21	Extent of New Breach Unclear	The largest credit card issuers were still uncertain which customer accounts had been affected by a computer security breach reported by MasterCard. Page C4.
2005-06-21	Black Market In Credit Cards Thrives on Web	''Want drive fast cars?'' asks an advertisement, in broken English, atop the Web site iaaca.com. ''Want live in premium hotels? Want own beautiful girls? It's possible with dumps from Zo0mer.'' A ''dump,'' in the blunt vernacular of a relentlessly flourishing online black market, is a credit card number. And what Zo0mer is peddling is stolen account information -- name, billing address, phone -- for Gold Visa cards and MasterCards at $100 apiece.
2005-06-21	Banks Unsure Which Cards Were Exposed In Breach	The nation's largest issuers of credit cards were still uncertain yesterday which customer accounts were affected by a computer security breach at a processing company that MasterCard reported Friday. MasterCard said that more than 40 million credit card accounts were exposed. And data from roughly 200,000 accounts from MasterCard, Visa and other card issuers are known to have been stolen in the breach.
2005-06-20	LOST CREDIT DATA IMPROPERLY KEPT, COMPANY ADMITS	The chief of the credit card processing company whose computer system was penetrated by data thieves, exposing 40 million cardholders to a risk of fraud, acknowledged yesterday that the company should not have been retaining those records. The official, John M. Perry, chief executive of CardSystems Solutions, indicated that the records known to have been stolen covered roughly 200,000 of the 40 million compromised credit card accounts, from Visa, MasterCard and other card issuers. He said the data was in a file being stored for ''research purposes'' to determine why certain transactions had registered as unauthorized or uncompleted.
2005-06-19	68,000 MasterCard Accounts Are at High Risk in Breach	MasterCard International said yesterday that the account information of more than 68,000 cardholders was especially at risk in a security breach that potentially involved data on millions of customers. Joshua Peirez, a MasterCard senior vice president, said the company had found evidence that a file with MasterCard cardholder data had been removed from a computer network in Tucson belonging to CardSystem Solutions, which processes credit card transactions.
2005-06-18	MASTERCARD SAYS 40 MILLION FILES ARE PUT AT RISK	MasterCard International reported yesterday that more than 40 million credit card accounts of all brands might have been exposed to fraud through a computer security breach at a payment processing company, perhaps the largest case of stolen consumer data to date. MasterCard said its analysts and law enforcement officials had identified a pattern of fraudulent charges that were traced to an intrusion at CardSystems Solutions of Tucson, Ariz., which processes more than $15 billion in payments for small to midsize merchants and financial institutions each year.

2005-06-14	A Fee Even the Card Issuers Cannot Explain	LARRY BRADLEY switches credit cards an average of once a year, but not to rack up extra frequent-flier miles or to pin down a lower interest rate. Mr. Bradley, a small-business owner from Tyrone, Ga., swaps plastic to escape rising currency-conversion fees. He has jumped from Visa to MasterCard to American Express, and back again, numerous times during the last decade in an effort to skirt surcharges on international transactions that have risen from 1 percent to as high as 4 percent. ''It's a money grab,'' he grumbled. ''Credit cards are hoping their customers won't read the fine print on their cardholder agreements. But I do.''
2005-06-13	Contributions To Candidates Via the Web Rise in the City	Zoe Werner banks online, shops online, talks to friends online. So when she received an e-mail message asking for a contribution to Gifford Miller's New York City mayoral campaign, she could not be bothered to write a check. Instead, Ms. Werner, a 26-year-old legal recruiter in Manhattan, did what a growing number of mostly new contributors are doing: She reached for her Visa card and went online to make a donation.
2005-06-12	Try the White Glove	AS always, the French have a word for it. The word is parvenu, and it refers to someone (or something) risen from nowhere to a position of wealth, power or celebrity. ''Often derogatory,'' the dictionary helpfully adds.
2005-06-03	Citigroup Is Acquiring Card Portfolio Of Store Chain	Citigroup said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the credit card portfolio of Federated Department Stores, continuing a string of acquisitions that Citigroup has made to bolster a business in which it has been struggling to retain market share. The bank will gain 17 million accounts as a result of the deal, a boon for Citigroup at a time when the credit card business over all has grown more competitive, with fewer consumers opening accounts.
2005-05-22	Lebanese Cuisine at a Luncheonette	THE restaurant's name, Myrna's Mediterranean Bistro, suggests a grandiosity that belies the modest, tidy luncheonette on a busy street in downtown Stamford. What keeps Myrna's from being a clone of other places like it is the Middle Eastern menu. Considering there are so few Middle Eastern restaurants in Connecticut -- I can count them on one hand -- that alone makes Myrna's well worth a visit. While each Middle Eastern country has its own specialties, certain dishes are common -- hummus, tabbouleh, falafel and kebabs come to mind -- and some have been incorporated into the Western diet. These dishes are on the menu at Myrna's, along with other less familiar choices.
2005-05-15	A Spritz From the Past	HOW can you resist a restaurant whose motif is a vintage seltzer bottle -- scores of them, in translucent pastels, stacked to form a tall divider that refracts multicolored light like a stained-glass window? A restaurant with 1940's red-vinyl banquettes and a big Art Deco clock and one of those white-on-black message boards you see in old diners, its push-in letters arranged to spell out an E.E. Cummings poem? in Just -- spring when the world is mud- luscious the little lame balloonman whistles far and wee and eddyandbill come running
2005-05-12	Like a Girdle for Your Credit Cards	THERE was a time, before the advent of fanny packs, messenger bags and the man-purse, when you knew what a wallet stood for. In the 1960's my father's scuffed brown leather wallet contained all the important things a man needed to navigate the world: cash, his driver's license and a claim check to retrieve the radio from the repair store.
2005-05-11	New spots for the credit card companies show fierce competition for the high-end consumer.	WHEN MasterCard rolled out its new Willy Wonka-themed television ads last night, it was aiming for the credit card industry's sweetest spot: the highly profitable ''new affluent'' consumer who spends several times what the average cardholder does and expects a cornucopia of rewards. The ad, set in a candy store, follows a couple as they dive into bins stocked with miniature golf carts and iPods and cash. It is a fantasy world of reward options, a place where incompetent customer service agents, hefty late fees and extended airline blackout periods do not exist.
2005-05-08	Funnels of Love	THE boy is about 4, and he is wiggly in the way that children are when they are hungry and must wait for food. He hoists himself to his knees. He leans over the table. He spars with a sibling. He fiddles with the condiments until they are placed beyond his reach. He plays with the silverware. Finally, the waiter approaches with a tray and the boy's dark eyes grow wide. He looks at his parents, and when they nod, his smile shows two rows of small, perfect teeth. The waiter puts several dishes on the table, and then, before the boy, he sets a platter upon which rests a hollow cone, broad at its base and nearly a foot tall. Deep bronze with touches of lighter tan beneath, it is a thing of drama and suspense until the boy reaches out, breaks off a piece and in a sharp cry that carries through the restaurant, says, ''I'll eat it all!''
2005-05-01	Kicks, Off Route 46	FOR a restaurant in a densely populated section of the nation's most densely populated state, the Fat Kat is about as far from the beaten track as you can get. Its address is Main Street in this central Bergen County industrial town, just a block south of the pounding night-and-day traffic of Route 46, but it has never had much prospect of walk-in customers. In fact, if you're walking, you may want to give a wide berth to the place next door, surrounded by a chain-link fence with a ''Beware of Dog'' sign. Other neighbors include an automatic laundry, a hardware store and a miscellany of Depression-era frame houses.
2005-04-27	AMERICAN EXPRESS REPORTS 19% RISE IN INCOME	The American Express Company said its net income rose 19 percent to a record as the company attracted new credit card customers from its partnership with the MBNA Corporation. First-quarter net income increased to $946 million, or 75 cents a share, from $794 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. The earnings per share were in line with the average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $7.57 billion, and expenses rose 9 percent, to $6.2 billion. American Express is benefiting from an agreement to allow MBNA to issue American Express credit cards along with MasterCards and Visa cards. MBNA handles marketing and collects credit card interest, and American Express receives a fee on every purchase.
2005-04-26	Credit Card Business Draws Bidders to Neiman Marcus	Some of the nation's largest credit card companies, including American Express and Citigroup, are bidding for the credit card business of the Neiman Marcus Group, executives involved in the negotiations said yesterday. Neiman put itself up for sale in March and has been quietly running a parallel auction for its private-label credit card business, which has about $550 million in receivables, the money still owed by shoppers. Last Thursday, Neiman received at least three bids worth more than $500 million for the credit card unit, the executives said. In addition to American Express and Citigroup, HSBC also submitted a bid.
2005-04-19	Soccer Plays on the Big Screen	Whether it is in Italy, England, Germany or nearly anywhere else in the world, hooliganism is the disfigured face of soccer, the beautiful game. The film director Lexi Alexander and the writer Dougie Brimson have been there, trashed that. The movie ''Hooligans,'' which will be shown next week at the TriBeCa Film Festival, is based on their experiences. It stars Elijah Wood (who played Frodo in ''The Lord of the Rings'' movies) as a doe-eyed American wrongfully kicked out of Harvard for dealing drugs. He goes to England to visit his sister and falls in with a firm (a gang) that supports London's West Ham United soccer club.
2005-04-17	Fusion, Hot and Cold	IT is the first item on the menu, and its name kanpachi tsuruki -- is formidable and strange. The price, $12, suggests ambition, and the description -- ''baby yellowtail drizzled with black truffle oil, garlic and lemon zest'' -- suggests Asian fusion cuisine. All of that is accurate enough, but it doesn't begin to convey the power and complexity of this dish, or the winning incongruity of coming upon it at Teak, a year-old restaurant that tries -- for the most part successfully -- to be several things at once.
2005-04-15	Polo Warns of Possible Problem With Credit Card Information	In another blow to consumer confidence in the security of personal data, the fashion giant Polo Ralph Lauren said yesterday that the credit card information of some customers may have been put at risk. The announcement comes after HSBC, the banking conglomerate, began sending letters to 180,000 holders of its GM-branded MasterCards last week to notify them of a ''security breach'' at an unidentified ''national retailer'' that may have compromised their accounts. The Wall Street Journal identified that retailer yesterday as Polo Ralph Lauren.
2005-04-10	A 1% Charge for Transactions Abroad	Foreign merchants are increasingly offering to convert their charges into dollars at the time of checkout, but credit card companies are not about to let merchants take away those services and the fees they produce. This month, Visa began levying a 1 percent fee on all foreign transactions, even when merchants conduct the currency conversion. Visa's charge applies only to the banks that issue the cards to customers, but David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a financial industry newsletter, said he expected that banks would pass along the charge to the customer. Mastercard will levy similar charges starting in October.
2005-04-07	Banks decide that credit cards make wonderful wallet-size billboards for use in self-promotion.	ALWAYS on the lookout for a good marketing opportunity, banks are aggressively elbowing their way onto the front of MasterCard and Visa credit cards. When J.P. Morgan Chase introduces its new credit cards next month, a supersize Chase logo will dwarf the tricolor Visa banner -- as well as the names of some of the bank's partners, like Amazon.com. Citigroup has its name splashed on the front of some of its MasterCards as bold as a Broadway marquee. After years of pressure from its member banks, Visa said that starting next fall, it would use a smaller logo on the front of its card.
2005-04-07	BUSINESS DIGEST	Battle Between Factions Weakens Morgan Stanley More than a week since a battle between rival factions over Morgan Stanley's future flared up, it is becoming clear that the victor will preside over a wounded Morgan Stanley. Philip J. Purcell, the firm's chief executive, is scrambling to fend off a campaign of attacks from eight retired Morgan Stanley executives who have demanded that he resign, accusing him of mismanaging the company. If he survives, Mr. Purcell will emerge a weakened leader. And if the eight dissident executives win, they will take over a bruised and battered firm. News Analysis. [Page A1.] A.I.G.

2005-04-05	Sizing Up a Credit Card That's Out on Its Own	After years of speculation that Morgan Stanley would shed its Discover credit card business, the company said last night that it planned to officially sever those ties. But will a spinoff of Discover really pay off? With more than $1.27 billion in profit last year, Discover Financial has been a cash cow for Morgan Stanley, accounting for about 20 percent of its net income last year. While critics have long complained that the unit has taken management's attention away from its core securities business, some question whether an independent Discover will be able to keep investors happy by producing strong earnings growth.
2005-04-05	Morgan to Explore a Discover Spinoff	In an abrupt strategy reversal, Philip J. Purcell, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said yesterday that his board had authorized him to pursue a spinoff of the company's Discover credit card business. The decision is a change in course for Mr. Purcell, who in recent days has been telling his increasingly restive shareholders that he considered the unit -- which he built from scratch as a Sears executive in the mid-1980's -- to be a crucial component of the firm.
2005-04-04	Now that credit card companies won't handle online tobacco sales, many merchants are calling it quits.	NOT since the dot-com bust have so many sites gone south so quickly. Two weeks after credit card companies announced they would no longer accept payment for tobacco products bought online, scores of Internet cigarette merchants have effectively lost the means to do business profitably, and are either limping along or have shut down their operations altogether.
2005-04-03	MasterCard Job? Almost Priceless	Apparently, the chance to run one of the biggest companies in the credit card industry has its price. MasterCard, which runs the much-parodied television ads about how some things in life are priceless, disclosed in its proxy that its chief executive, Robert W. Selander, will collect a $10 million bonus just for keeping his job five to six more years.
2005-04-03	From the Ashes	WHEN Little Saigon abruptly ended a five-year run in downtown Nutley in September 2002, victim of a fire that broke out in an adjoining storefront, North Jersey's community of ethnic-food lovers fell into mourning. ''Little Saigon was my favorite restaurant in New Jersey,'' one of them wrote on nj.com's Nutley Forum more than a year later. ''It is so sad that it is gone. Does anyone know whether they will open a new one?'' A good thing Little Saigon's owner, Nghia Bui (pronounced nyeh bwee), has conquered adversity before. A 52-year-old native of Vietnam who fled that country with thousands of others during its horrific war with Cambodia, he spent years in refugee camps in Malaysia and the Philippines before settling in New Jersey in the early 1990's. After the devastating fire in Nutley, he and his team of chefs -- his wife, Quan, and her sister, Sang Hua -- slowly rebuilt their business, choosing a much bigger space here in Montclair. They reopened four months ago, to widespread jubilation.
2005-03-27	Broke	In the mid-1970's, around the time the parents of several school friends began going broke and losing their small farms because of high interest rates and falling crop prices, an envelope bearing an unfamiliar logo appeared in our mailbox. I carried it to the house and set it on the kitchen counter next to the radio my mother was listening to as she fried liver and onions on her old stove. She opened the envelope with a paring knife and drew out the thin, rectangular hard object I had been fingering through the paper. I remember the odd expression on her face -- a mixture of optimism and apprehension -- as she held the novelty out to me and said, ''It's a BankAmericard.'' About a week later the kitchen radio was replaced by a portable TV set. By the next summer, when the banks started foreclosing on our neighbors' farms, my mother's old stove had been replaced as well, a microwave oven stood beside it and the BankAmericards in my parents' wallets had been joined by American Express cards. Every line of credit tells a story. Over the last few decades, as average Americans have taken on vastly higher levels of personal debt using an ever-increasing variety of financial instruments, the number and complexity of these stories have multiplied exponentially. The interactions of these millions of stories (does one family's updated kitchen, for example, relate in some way to the failing farm next door?) may be too difficult to comprehend, even for experts armed with supercomputers. What we all understand, however, is that these stories have only two fundamental endings.
2005-03-26	Credit Card Issuers Adjust to Open Field	When you finally get the thing you wanted most for years, what do you do with it? That question faces American Express and Discover Financial Services, now that the Supreme Court, in a sweeping decision last October, gave them permission to work with the more than 14,000 financial institutions that issue credit cards through Visa and MasterCard. Until the ruling, Visa International and MasterCard had rules forbidding bank members from working with other networks.
2005-03-26	Follow the Vanishing Check	Larry Lyons, who is 23, vividly remembers the Saturday mornings when his mother would write checks to pay the family's bills, dispatching him to the landlord with one for the rent. When he was in sixth grade, she taught him to balance a checkbook. What he has more trouble remembering is the last time he wrote a check himself.
2005-03-20	Traditional Italian With a Dollop of Flair	AS I shed my coat and gloves on my first visit to Lia's, I was drawn to a plate glass window framing the activity in the kitchen. Patrons can perch at the bar and watch every move of the chef and his staff. It's a little like peering into a crowded aquarium, where fish swirl about in all directions but miraculously avoid collision. This invitation to scrutiny suggests not so much an inclination to showmanship as an unwavering confidence, clear at every turn in Craig Cupani's precise and delicious food. Mr. Cupani, whose menu in early March was brightened by late-winter beauties like lemons, fennel and new-crop artichokes, interprets traditional Italian cuisine with modern flair. Veterans of the Manhattan restaurant scene, Mr. Cupani, formerly of Patroon, Tabla, Brasserie and the ''21'' Club, and his wife, Imre, previously at Arcadia and ''21,'' opened Lia's in November.
2005-03-13	Packing Serious Heat	IF you find yourself in Flemington, land of chain restaurants and outlet malls, and you hunger in your soul and in your belly for something more -- maybe delicate tortilla chips with head-clearing salsa, tender lamb soup with cilantro, sharp and sweet cactus and jicama salad, succulent slabs of chicken enclosed in a house-made cloak of velvety masa drizzled with a piquant green sauce, or a round of dense and golden flan, then get off the main drag and go to Viva Mexico. Or, if you find yourself at home, and you begin thinking of poblano chiles and the way their sly heat plays against the fresh, slight crunch of the flesh and the satisfaction of the meaty filing and the red sauce and then a fork full of beans, with or without a few grains of rice, then drive to Flemington, or better yet, call up a few friends and go together. This is food you want to share.
2005-03-09	VICTORY FOR BUSH	The Senate assured final passage of the first major overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws in 27 years on Tuesday, when it took two votes that cleared the remaining political obstacles to a measure that the nation's credit and retail industries have sought for years. The bill would disqualify many families from taking advantage of the more generous provisions of the current bankruptcy code that permit them to extinguish their debts for a ''fresh start.'' It would also impose significant new costs on those seeking bankruptcy protection and give lenders and businesses new legal tools for recovering debts.
2005-03-09	$25 AND UNDER; For a French Second Act, a Wardrobe Change	THERE'S a lot riding on a restaurant sequel. Like its cinematic counterparts, it has to gratify die-hard fans while gaining new ones. In Brooklyn, the three-month-old Bouillabaisse 126 is to the late, great La Bouillabaisse what, say, ''Road Warrior'' was to the original ''Mad Max.'' It reinterprets the original's low-budget, indie cool for wider audiences and commercial success.
2005-03-06	Time to Reach for World Cup Tickets	Soccer's World Cup finals don't begin until June 9, 2006, but it's not too early to try to get tickets. And ''try'' is the operative term: the first phase of sales -- 812,000 tickets, according to FIFA, the sport's governing body -- will be through a drawing from applications received by March 31. At $1.33 to the euro, prices begin at $46.50 for the cheapest seats for 47 first-round matches (higher for the opening match, in Munich), and go to $800 for the most expensive ticket for the final, July 9, 2006, in Berlin, where the cup, left, will finally be hoisted.
2005-03-02	$25 AND UNDER; Spicy Indonesian Nights	ONE hot summer night, during a fruitless search for kaffir lime leaves in Chinatown, my girlfriend and I stopped in an Indonesian grocery where she swore she'd seen them before. The lead was a bust, except for some frank advice from the shopkeeper: we asked where we could find a great Indonesian restaurant, and he unflinchingly replied, ''Indonesia.'' His abrupt pronouncement put me off the scent for a little while. A disappointing trip to a newly opened spot in Elmhurst, Queens, made me think he might be right. I eventually got to thinking that while traveling to Indonesia to eat Indonesian food might be workable if you occasionally drop in on relatives there, it wasn't going to work out for me. But there are a handful of places in the city that do a capable job scratching an itch for satay. Warteg Fortuna A bare sliver of a restaurant stuck between a tire yard and a barbed-wire-rimmed lot, Warteg Fortuna is almost directly under the No. 7 train's 52nd Street stop on a particularly unscenic block in Woodside. There's no menu, just a bulletin board with a couple of dishes and prices, and no tables, just six stools along the walls. Almost everybody is eating the house specialty, combination plates of rice dotted with different curries ($3.75).
2005-02-27	Kind of Blue	LESS than four years ago, this column celebrated the arrival of a fine new restaurant in the shadow of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. Called Arthur's Downtown, it occupied a gorgeously refurbished space on the ground floor of the Military Park Building, a fine neo-Gothic 1926 landmark that for many years was New Jersey's tallest structure. Arthur's served terrific New American food to a well-off, racially diverse crowd of concertgoers, food aficionados and Newark movers and shakers. Then, as swiftly as the Titanic, it sank without a trace. To most of us, it was just the latest sad tale from a city that has been handing them out in dismal succession for nearly 40 years. To Philip Darrow and his partners, Stan and Danny Gale, it was an opportunity. Last June, they reopened the restaurant as the Savoy Grill, leaving intact the burnished men's-club décor and the alluring Art Deco exterior, with its red and blue neon signs that glow like beacons in the Newark nightscape.
2005-02-23	J.P. Morgan Decides to Offer 2 Credit Cards	Ever since J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged to become the nation's largest issuer of credit cards, questions have swirled over whether MasterCard or Visa would become the combined bank's preferred brand. J.P. Morgan Chase deftly announced yesterday that it did not have a favored partner. Customers, it said, can continue to choose between credit, debit and commercial cards bearing either the Visa or MasterCard brands.
2005-02-23	$25 AND UNDER; American Fare in Apple-Pie Surroundings	''LOOK!'' my friend yelped, as if she had spotted a species that had long since gone extinct. ''Driveways!'' We were in a sliver of Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, that seemed plucked from another planet or at least from a city more Rockwellian than ours. With every quirkily painted Victorian house and porch swing we passed, the name of the restaurant we were bound for -- Picket Fence -- made more sense.
2005-02-22	Brothers Raised on Cash Build a Business on Credit	IN Monterrey, Mexico, where Roy and Bertrand Sosa grew up playing Atari and street soccer, cash paid for everything -- the rent, the water bill, the white Volkswagen Beetle. Even at fancy restaurants, the brothers never glimpsed a Visa card, and they never used credit until college in Austin, Tex. So in the late 1990's, when upbeat dot-coms promised to build online über-malls, the Sosa brothers wondered about how people without plastic could shop on the Internet.
2005-02-20	From Russia, Humbly	WHEN I visited what was then the Soviet Union, in 1983, tourists could eat in two distinct kinds of restaurants. There were the huge, hangarlike dining palaces, with kitschy décor, ghastly floor shows and platters of gunmetal-gray mystery meat washed down with ''Soviet Champagne,'' which tasted like citrate of magnesia. And there were smaller invitation-only places reserved for officials, the elite and tourists carrying dollars rather than rubles. These places served real, and wonderful, regional food. In Azerbaijan, for instance, our hosts laid on a banquet of smoked fish and grilled meats, fresh cucumbers and melons and tomatoes, warm flatbreads, caviar from the Caspian Sea and, of course, endless streams of vodka and local cognac.
2005-02-12	New York Hits Online Sellers Of Cigarettes	Concerned about the booming trade in online cigarette sales, New York state officials have begun using a variety of techniques to clamp down on the trade, saying New York City alone is losing more than $75 million a year in uncollected tax revenues because of the sales. In recent weeks, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has been pushing local postal officials and private carriers to stop delivering cigarettes bought online. His office has also recently begun negotiations with credit card companies to block transactions of online cigarettes.
2005-02-06	Oceanography	IT glides to your table at Daruma like a two-masted schooner, bound for some palm-fringed Pacific harbor 5,000 miles from the nearest mall. The passengers are a dashing assortment of sea creatures in cheery tropical get-up: tuna in the pink of health; gleaming yellowtail; pearly octopus, with its purplish scalloped edges; plump, stripy shrimp; a dazzling rosette of pale fluke topped with orange marbles of salmon roe; and two rainbowlike rolls incorporating cucumber and soft-shell crab, eel and salmon and spicy tuna. This is paradise, right? Well, actually, it's Englewood, and what has dropped anchor is the Daruma Love Boat for Two, whose hokey name and $60 price tag are momentary reminders that a high-rent boutique district lies just outside on North Dean Street. But that brief, cold thought passes, for several reasons.
2005-02-02	American Express Plans To Spin Off Wall St. Unit	Financial supermarkets are not looking so super anymore. The American Express Company announced yesterday that it was spinning off its financial advisory business in an effort to focus on its card and travel services operations.
2005-01-23	Secret Sharers	A MEAL at Rocca has an almost conspiratorial feeling. Clutching a bottle or two of bring-your-own wine, you pass through a tiny foyer and a curtain to face two rooms -- one of them large, dim and boxy, the other smaller, brighter and semicircular, each furnished in an Italian-farmhouse motif highlighted by modish blacks and whites. If you're lucky, you'll be seated in the semicircular one. This room is a holdover from the building's past as home to Mezzaluna, an Italian restaurant whose name meant ''half moon.'' It looks out on Rock Road, the main drag of a prosperous but underappreciated borough that has long existed in the shadow of Ridgewood, that bright and bustling diva to the north. Despite the recent arrival of a rather grand-looking Starbucks, downtown Glen Rock has a tendency to roll up its immaculate sidewalks at dusk. So diners at Rocca (pronounced ROE-kuh) may feel they've been let in on a particularly welcome secret. An ambitious restaurant here? With multiple chefs in the kitchen and homemade focaccia in the bread basket and live jazz on Tuesday nights? Don't tell anyone!
2005-01-18	G.E. BUYS PART OF FIRST DATA'S MASTERCARD BUSINESS	The First Data Corporation, the world's largest processor of credit card payments, has agreed to sell its portfolio of Canadian small-business MasterCards to GE Consumer Finance, a unit of the General Electric Company. First Data, based in Denver, will service the accounts after the sale, the company said. GE Consumer Finance, which provides credit services to consumers, retailers and auto dealers in 41 countries, is one of 12 companies that issue MasterCards in Canada. General Electric is based in Stamford, Conn.
2005-01-10	Momentum Is Gaining for Cellphones as Credit Cards	People already use their cellphones to read e-mail messages, take pictures and play video games. Before long, they may use them in place of their wallets. By embedding in the cellphone a computer chip or other type of memory device, a phone can double as a credit card. The chip performs the same function as the magnetic strip on the back of a credit card, storing account information and other data necessary to make a purchase.
2005-01-09	Malaysian Depot	AN expedition to Penang, the Morris County outpost of a restaurant empire that began a decade ago in Queens, would benefit from some planning. You should assemble a group; seven or eight is a good number, though really, the more the merrier. They should be a bit adventurous, and they should be very hungry. And if one of them knows Malaysian food, so much the better. I speak from experience. My first visit, with four unschooled dining companions on a busy Saturday night, was pleasant enough, but it felt miscellaneous and unfocused, as if I'd wandered into a big-box home-improvement warehouse not knowing whether I needed a screwdriver, a screen door or a bathtub. The ''Malaysian/Thai'' menu holds 161 items, some with generic if vaguely scary names (fish porridge, crispy pork intestines) and others sounding exotic and faintly giddy (seafood prik pow, bobo cha cha). Where to begin? Where to stop? The jolly crew of servers, with their black uniforms, colorful aprons and mixed command of English, could offer little guidance.
2004-12-26	Retro Bistro	AH, Hoboken. Is there another city on the planet where the needs and desires of today's upper crust are fulfilled so exquisitely by the legacies of yesterday's working class? Case in point, as Rod Serling would say: the Elysian Cafe. The Elysian originally opened about 1897. A 1943 menu offered fillet of sole for 65 cents, filet mignon for $1.85 and ''bonded whiskeys on request.'' ''During Prohibition,'' its current owners, Joyce and Eugene Flinn, wrote me recently, ''the business operated as a speakeasy disguised as, of all things, a beauty parlor.''
2004-12-16	WALGREEN WILL STOP ACCEPTING AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS	The Walgreen Company said it would stop accepting American Express cards effective Jan. 14 because, it said, the fees were higher than those of Visa and MasterCard. American Express cards account for ''a small fraction of Walgreen total credit card transactions,'' Walgreen said. The company, based in Deerfield, Ill., operates 4,681 stores. American Express has not raised its rates since Walgreen began accepting the card in 1996, but purchases on American Express are not ''significantly larger than the average customer'' and do not offset the fees, a Walgreen spokesman, Michael Polzin, said. ''We hope Walgreen will reconsider,'' said Nancy Muller, a spokeswoman for American Express.
2004-12-14	Citigroup Says It Will Issue American Express Cards	In the credit card world, it pays to be persistent. American Express, which fought for years for the right to sign deals with United States banks that issue cards on the Visa and MasterCard networks, said late yesterday that it had won a contract with Citigroup, the biggest credit card company in the world.
2004-12-12	Osso Buco, My Friend	CENT'ANNI means ''100 years.'' For restaurants, that is an almost impossible lifespan; most are long gone before they reach Cent'Anni's age (eight next March). But this big, genial restaurant shows no signs of slowing down. Just as human centenarians have their formulas for longevity -- good genes, prudent habits, a nightly glass of red wine -- Cent'Anni seems to have all the right ingredients for a long and prosperous old age. The first three are location, location and location. The restaurant lives on a pleasant side street, a few doors up the hill from the 1940's movie set that is Maplewood's downtown. The train station is an easy walk. So is the Maplewood Theater, though in the 40's it probably didn't have six screens. Parking is no challenge.
2004-12-11	BUSINESS DIGEST	Sprint Near $34 Billion Deal For Nextel Communications Sprint is near a deal to acquire Nextel Communications for more than $34 billion. A merger would create a powerful competitor in the field with some 39 million cellphone customers.
2004-12-11	MBNA Stops Unsolicited Switching of Customer Credit Cards	The MBNA Corporation, the largest independent issuer of credit cards, has decided that it should ask for permission before switching its customers' credit cards to American Express cards. Responding to complaints from customers who did not want the American Express cards MBNA sent them, a spokesman said yesterday that the company would stop the automatic replacement policy that was being applied to some of its Visa and MasterCard cards.
2004-12-09	NEWS SUMMARY	INTERNATIONAL A3-21 Complaints From Troops Put Rumsfeld on Defense Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld found himself on the defensive while fielding questions from Iraq-bound troops who complained that they were being sent into combat with insufficient protection and aging equipment. The complaints are likely to revive accusations that the Bush administration failed to anticipate the tenacious insurgency. A1 Iraq's leading Shiite political groups agreed to unite under a single banner, a move that could help them win a dominant share of votes in the national elections. Sseveral Sunni parties registered to field candidates. The two decisions appeared to strengthen the chances of a January vote, despite continuing violence. A18 The military has disciplined four members of a Special Operations unit for abusing detainees at a Baghdad interrogation camp earlier this year. The exact penalties were not disclosed nor their identities. A18 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell urged Europeans to get over their opposition to the Iraq war so they could ''support the Iraqi people.'' American officials laid out new obligations they were asking Europe to accept -- in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the West Bank and Gaza. A18 Libya Revising Execution View Libya will not execute five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who were sentenced to death earlier this year for infecting more than 400 children with H.I.V. in 1998. The son of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, said the country would soon pass new laws to limit capital punishment. A17 Political Overhaul in Ukraine President Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine and the country's Parliament adopted an overhaul of the political system. The agreement smoothed the way for a new runoff, but the winner of that contest will inherit fewer powers. A6 NATIONAL A24-39 Treasury Secretary Is Asked to Stay on Job President Bush asked Treasury Secretary John W. Snow to remain in his job, the White House said, after weeks in which Republicans close to the White House had spoken openly about Mr. Snow's impending departure and administration officials were interviewing possible successors. A1 Gay Rights Strategy Dispute Leaders of the gay rights movement are embroiled in a bitter and increasingly public debate over whether they should moderate their goals after 11 states approved constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriages in November. A1 Union Debate Heats Up The Teamsters union heated up the debate over reshaping the labor movement by proposing to cut the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s budget and to finance a four-year campaign of political and union organizing in swing states to help elect a pro-labor president. A37 Skepticism in Source Case A three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Washington, hearing arguments on whether two journalists should be jailed for refusing to name their confidential sources to a grand jury, seemed to reject their main argument, which is based on the First Amendment. A28 Spy Bill Passes Senate The Senate voted to approve a landmark bill to restructure the nation's intelligence community, completing Congressional action on a measure backed by President Bush that is intended to put an end to the sort of intelligence lapses that plagued the nation's spy agencies before the Sept. 11 attacks. A36 The intelligence overhaul approved by the Senate reorganizes the way the states grant driver's licenses, a change that civil liberties advocates and some security experts say could have far-reaching consequences. A36 NEW YORK/REGION B1-12 Three States Suffer High Death Toll in Iraq Since Nov. 7, when the attack on Falluja began, 19 servicemen from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have been killed in Iraq, making it the deadliest term for soldiers from those three states since the start of the war. A1 New Drug Law Questioned Advocates for prison reform criticized the Legislature's decision to ease New York State's severe drug sentencing laws, contending that the changes may reduce public pressure for a more comprehensive overhaul in the way New York treats drug offenders. B1 Comptroller Rules Out Run William C. Thompson Jr., the New York City comptroller, who was considered among the most formidable potential opponents to Michael R.

2004-12-09	Credit Card Loyalty Put to the Switch Test	When Patrick F. McIntyre received two American Express cards in the mail last month, he did not feel as if he had been welcomed into an exclusive club. Instead, he felt like a pawn in the credit card industry's latest maneuver. The MBNA Corporation, the issuer of the Visa credit cards that Mr. McIntyre and his wife had carried for 14 years, had switched his account to American Express without his permission, he said. He likened the tactic to ''slamming,'' the practice some phone companies used in the 1990's to steal away competitors' customers.
2004-12-08	Don't Forget to Bring Your Own Truth Serum	NO need to shop for the perfect holiday fleece when you can impress your best gal with an intimate Friday evening rapt in conversation with the warm and fuzzy Barry Bonds. It's only five minutes or so, and you may feel rushed in the moment, but at $10,000 per couple -- or $7,500 for a party of one -- you can bond with Bonds at a Midtown Manhattan hotel.
2004-12-06	International Business; Untapped Market for Credit Cards Is Ripe for Foreign Lenders	ANYONE looking for signs that China is edging its way into Western consumer culture should consider this: The Bank of China, the oldest indigenous Chinese bank, now issues a Great Wall platinum Visa credit card, and it comes with a frequent-flier rewards program. Today, only about 1 percent of Chinese citizens hold Western-style credit cards, and they tend to be the wealthiest of urban sophisticates. A majority of people use cash for all transactions; either they do not have bank accounts, or they have never been offered credit by a bank. What little personal lending occurs in China usually consists of informal arrangements among friends, family members or business associates.
2004-11-30	Wal-Mart Drags Down Retailers and the S.&P. 500	The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell yesterday as disappointing November sales at Wal-Mart Stores overshadowed signs that retailing generally benefited from the start of the holiday shopping season. ''If Wal-Mart is cutting their November forecast, that's enough to outweigh the fact that other retailers had nice sales gains,'' said James McGlynn, who helps manage $6 billion at Summit Investment Partners in Cincinnati. Wal-Mart ''cast a pall.''
2004-11-29	Markdowns, And Shoppers, Are Out Early This Season	As rain pelted down on Fifth Avenue yesterday afternoon, brave -- or simply desperate -- umbrella-carrying shoppers kept right on shopping, after crowds on Friday enlivened retailers into thinking this holiday season may be a fairly healthy one, after all. Retailers across the country, worried by projections of a lackluster season from analysts and trade groups, had responded with heavy markdowns, starting the day after Thanksgiving. Virtually every major department store chain had advertised clearance sales -- much of it summer and fall merchandise.
2004-11-21	Soaring Interest Is Compounding Credit Card Woes for Millions	When Ed Schwebel was whittling down his mound of credit card debt at an interest rate of 9.2 percent, the MBNA Corporation had a happy and profitable customer. But this summer, when MBNA suddenly doubled the rate on his account, Mr. Schwebel joined the growing ranks of irate cardholders stunned by lenders' harsh tactics. Mr. Schwebel, 58, a semiretired software engineer in Gilbert, Ariz., was not pleased that his minimum monthly payment jumped from $502 in June to $895 in July. But what really made him angry, he said, was the sense that he was being punished despite having held up his end of the bargain with MBNA.
2004-11-16	BUSINESS DIGEST	Two Former Top Executives Of Hollinger Sued by S.E.C. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit against Conrad M. Black and F. David Radler, the two former top executives of Hollinger International, accusing them of bilking the newspaper company of millions of dollars and conspiring to conceal their self-dealing from shareholders and regulators. The commission would also like to strip Lord Black of any authority to cast votes based on the controlling stake he continues to hold in the company.

2004-11-10	Stand Aside, Rudolph: The Mouse Will Lead	AS with anything else that's done on the Web, whether trolling a million medical sites or sifting through a thousand recipes for fried chicken, choosing food online is like buying a pig in a poke. After a year of navigating hundreds of sites and ordering from scores, here is my whittled list of some of the best holiday gifts, based on taste, appearance or utility. With more than 20 years of hunting down holiday gifts and thinking there can't be another next new thing, I'm always surprised when something turns up. This year it is fresh Alaskan king salmon in the middle of December, rice pudding for the inner child in every grown-up and a $20 gadget that makes foam out of skim milk.
2004-11-10	$25 AND UNDER; A Trip to Peru by Way of the East Village	WHEN it comes to certain cuisines, Manhattan addresses raise eyebrows and suspicions. Here? In the East Village? Peruvian? It can't be the real thing. Fans expect to travel closer to communities of native cooks to find restaurants that cater to the most discerning palates, Peruvian or otherwise. Mancora caters to East Villagers, and a raucous subset of them at that. Its jaunty room, an explosion of seashell chandeliers, octopus murals and fish nets, is buoyant with sangria-sipping crowds and South American soundtracks, especially on weekends.
2004-11-07	Italian Fare That's All in the Timing	WHILE several visits to a restaurant are helpful -- even mandatory -- they can occasionally be confusing rather than clarifying. This was the case on three visits to Tenero in South Norwalk. The first trip brought forth food that was good but spotty, with several dishes, like a special soup of cannelloni (white kidney beans) and fresh tomatoes, recklessly oversalted. Other dishes were tasty, if conventional.
2004-11-06	MBNA ISSUING AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARDS	MBNA said yesterday that it had introduced a line of credit cards under the American Express brand. In January, MBNA became the first big Visa and MasterCard bank in the United States to agree to issue cards on the American Express network. Last month, it received a green light to do so when the Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal by Visa and MasterCard to a court decision that gave banks permission to work with other networks. MBNA, based in Wilmington, Del., said that the first offers were mailed to members of 1,000 of the affinity groups for which MBNA issues cards. More than 300,000 people signed up for the cards in advance, MBNA said. Jennifer A. Kingson (NYT)
2004-11-05	HSBC and Partner Offer Credit Card in China	HSBC Holdings and its Chinese partner, the Bank of Communications, have set up a business to offer local currency credit cards, the second venture for HSBC in China, a market with $1.46 trillion in savings. The Bank of Communications has a three-year agreement to sell credit cards under the HSBC brand, the Chinese lender said in a statement Thursday. Zhang Dandan, a spokeswoman in Shanghai for HSBC, confirmed that the credit card unit had been set up.
2004-10-27	$25 AND UNDER; The Soul of the Vietnamese Kitchen	WHEN Vietnamese restaurants began to arrive in New York in the early 1990's, they were greeted rapturously by connoisseurs of Asian food. Fresh herbs! Lively flavors! Seemingly lighter than Chinese cooking, less fiery than Thai, Vietnamese food promised a much-needed blast of fresh air. It's been disappointing, then, that so few Vietnamese options have appeared beyond the Chinatowns of Manhattan and Brooklyn. That's still true, but the best Vietnamese food I've tasted in New York is in a neighborhood more notable for its Italian bakeries than its Asian restaurants: the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn, a quiet neighborhood just south of Bensonhurst.
2004-10-24	New (Age) American	''THE name Chakra, inspired by the ancient yoga systems of India,'' says a press release for this eight-month-old restaurant, ''refers to spinning vortices of energy created within us by the interpenetration of consciousness and physical body . . . a connection to the mind, body and spirit, subtly channeled through the senses.'' Goodness. Is this a restaurant or a New Age massage? In truth, neither the name nor the public relations blather gives any clue to what Chakra is all about. And this is a good thing, because its pleasures turn out to be unexpected and many.
2004-10-24	Gone in 60 Seconds	PAUSING in the foyer of a comfortable suburban home two days before Halloween in 2002, Kevin Barrows, a special agent with the F.B.I., could not bring himself to open the front door. He and a team of agents had just spent several hours searching every room in the house, in New Rochelle, N.Y., but they were leaving empty-handed. Months of investigating had led Mr. Barrows to believe that someone was orchestrating a huge fraud from the house, yet he had not found a single scrap of evidence. Still, something bothered him about the furniture in one of the bedrooms. It seemed oddly oversized. So he headed back upstairs for a second look, and his attention focused on an expansive canopy over the bed. When he pushed at the draping, he found that it was weighed down with files. They contained reams of confidential financial information about hundreds of individuals whose identities had been pilfered in an intricate scheme that illicitly netted more than $50 million.
2004-10-10	Rat Pack Chic	SITTING in the office of his title search company, overlooking the decaying eyesore that was a half-abandoned century-old paper factory, Richie Cecere allowed himself a daydream. It was a snowy morning about nine years ago, and on that weed-choked triangular lot opposite the Walnut Street train station he imagined something so retro, so early-60's swanky, so utterly un-Montclair that even in hindsight it seems outlandish. The dream went this way: He would transform the blighted factory into a Manhattan-style supper club from the era of the Rainbow Room and the Copacabana, the kind of place he loved to visit as a wide-eyed teenager fresh off the train from Jersey. It would have everything: mohair banquettes, mahogany and black leather, glistening tableware, visiting celebrities, chorus girls -- and, of course, a band. Richie Cecere's Jazz Orchestra! Eighteen guys on a banked and spotlighted stage, belting out the brassy, expansive arrangements that laid down carpets of sound for the likes of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and . . . ladies and gentlemen . . . the legendary . . . Mis-ter Bobby Darin!
2004-10-05	Rivals Take Aim at Visa and MasterCard	Consumers already swamped with offers from credit card companies can expect more solicitations in the coming months from American Express and Discover Financial Services. The two companies said yesterday that they would move quickly to sign partnerships with banks after the Supreme Court let stand a ruling that Visa and MasterCard violated federal antitrust law barring member banks from issuing rival cards in the United States.
2004-10-05	BUSINESS DIGEST	PeopleSoft Director Cites Reasons for Chief's Firing A director of PeopleSoft said that Craig A. Conway, the company's chief executive, was fired on Friday in part because he made false statements at an analysts' conference in Sept. 2003.
2004-10-03	American, Yet Global	IT was a breezy night, the chill of fall in the air, and my first visit to Hannah & Mason's, the New American restaurant that was creating buzz in central New Jersey. We parked the car, then walked quickly to the address, with its outside tables along the sidewalk, and then more outside tables around the corner, everything somewhat illuminated by burning torches. There were no inside tables. None. So we sat outside, chilling along with our wine. But we ate food that had promise, tolerated the voluble waiter and left with enough good vibes to make plans for a return visit and a review.

2004-09-30	Merchants Pay (and Pay) for Right to Use Credit Cards	The challenges that face business start-ups are familiar enough: scraping together start-up capital, hiring talent, fighting government red tape, recruiting customers. But pity small retail shops. For them, and other small businesses that rely on foot traffic or the Internet, a big frustration is getting a credit card terminal up and running. It is not a simple task. MasterCard and Visa require small businesses to enroll through intermediaries like payment processors, financial institutions or independent sales organizations, commonly referred to as I.S.O.'s, which solicit business through telemarketing and even door-to-door agents. (American Express permits registration both directly and through intermediaries.)
2004-09-26	South American Palette	WHEN I left Cucharamama after my second visit under standard practice, my last -- I felt a sharp pang of regret. I had dined amazingly well. But I had failed to order the fabada de horno, described so fetchingly on the menu as ''a Latin cassoulet of white beans, sausages, smoked bacon and kale, slow-cooked in the wood-burning oven.'' There was nothing to do but come back a third time. Imagine my dismay, a few nights later, when the waiter gently broke the news that I hadn't read the fine print. The fabada is served on Fridays and Saturdays only. I was 24 hours early. I could either camp out, alongside the whimsical cast-iron turtle that guards the restaurant's front stoop, or I could order the only other main dish on the weeknight menu that I hadn't already tried: saice (pronounced sah-EE-say), spicy braised beef and potatoes in the style of Bolivia. Oh, all right, I replied sullenly. The saice, please.
2004-09-22	$25 AND UNDER; Spanish Comforts, Spanish Adventures	WHEN New Yorkers need to find something, no matter how minutely specific, they often visit craigslist.com, a community board that whittles the world down to what you want from it. So when the owners of Tía Pol, a new tapas bar carved into a narrow Chelsea storefront, needed an Iberian-inclined chef who knew pinchos from pintxos, they posted an ad. They were looking for someone who could create the kind of creative fare the owners had sampled in Madrid's trendier tapas places.
2004-09-22	In the Meatpacking District, Packed In	SELDOM has a Manhattan neighborhood gone from intriguing to annoying -- from on-the-cusp to over-the-top -- with the distressing speed and depressing thoroughness of the meatpacking district. It is not really a neighborhood anymore. It is an urban theme park: a gaudy epicurean grab bag that weds cuisines from here and there to cocktails from the here and now. It is a ''Sex and the City'' fantasy in which would-be Carries and could-be Bigs look for love and settle for lamb under supremely flattering lighting. The lighting is terrific at 5 Ninth; the would-be's are at every third table, and they are pressed in tight. This sexy, exciting, exasperating restaurant is not for anyone who wants peace and calm. Like its neighborhood, it is for people who crave the jostle of too many bodies in too limited a space. It is also for people willing to choose unsteady exuberance over steady expertise. It has style and energy to burn, but 5 Ninth lacks discipline and judgment in terms of its service and, to a lesser extent, its food. It feels adolescent: ambitious but imprudent, creative but sloppy.
2004-09-12	Little Italy	FROM the moment you enter through the bank of French doors that separate it from the street, Trattoria Fresco exerts an irresistible pull. Part of it is the hearty, unaffected welcome from the young staff. A bigger part is the open kitchen, situated right at the front of the house, where less astute owners might have put a coatroom. The centerpiece of the kitchen is a tall wood-burning brick oven, in constant use and emitting a faint, pleasant haze of smoke that permeates the two dining rooms. A companion, spotting a stuffed roasted red pepper leaving the oven on a wooden paddle, ordered it then and there. And as we were being escorted to our table, a wild-mushroom pizza caught my gaze and followed it like Mona Lisa's eyes.
2004-09-08	The Magic of Napa With Urban Polish	THE butter-poached lobster almost did it, but not quite. I had been wooed with succulent lobster before. The Island Creek oysters and Iranian caviar, mingled in a kind of sabayon that I was served during that same dinner and during others, made a seductive case. But I was wary of such ostentation. In the end, it was a different night and a nine-course vegetable tasting, of all things, that made me drop any reserve, cast aside any doubts and accept the fact that I loved Per Se -- and that this preening, peacock-vain newcomer deserved it.
2004-08-18	Something Comfortable to Slip Into	THERE are times when all the foams, clouds, emulsions and other flesh-crowning, flesh-flanking nebulas become a bit much. When the solace of time-tested conventions beats the exhilaration of newfangled conceits. When you crave something fixed in its culinary place, not fused with an exotic interloper. Those are the times for Gavroche.
2004-08-15	Where the View Competes With the Food	FOR any impresario seeking inspiration, Harvest-on-Hudson here might provide a model. For six years this show has gone on every night with panache and grace, and the backdrop -- the view over the Hudson River and the Palisades -- provides a stunning special effect. Harvest-on-Hudson is one of a family of four restaurants, the other three in Montauk. They all have gardens, patios, sunsets and water views in common. Prices are on the high side, but the cost of a meal pays for much more than food and drink.
2004-08-15	An American Niche	SOME restaurants announce themselves with a drum roll and a shout of brass; others find their niche and just settle in. An American Grill is firmly in the second camp. Now coming up on its 10th anniversary, it fits its affluent outer-suburban setting as comfortably as a calfskin shoe. It is a masculine place, thickly planted with mahogany and patterned carpets, long mirrors and frosted glass. Wooden crossbeams and round pendant lamps give it the feeling of an updated gentlemen's club. The chef and owner, Louis Reda, is a thoroughgoing professional, born to the business and brought up in a kitchen. (His father, Frank, still runs Il Villaggio, down Route 10 in Morris Plains.) At 39, the younger Mr. Reda has been cooking and serving for more than half his life. By now, he could do it in his sleep; that he keeps his place humming at this level is a tribute to his high standards and attention to detail.
2004-08-11	MasterCard drops the names of major retailers into the print portion of its 'priceless' campaign.	ANNUAL spending by MasterCard to advertise in major media: about $300 million. Portion of that spending earmarked for advertisements in magazines and newspapers: about 15 percent to 20 percent of the total.
2004-08-04	$25 AND UNDER; Chinese Exports, Marinated in India	''DRY or gravy?'' This is the fundamental question when ordering Chinese-Indian food, whether at the handful of new restaurants that serve it in Queens or at the seven-month-old Chinese Mirch on Lexington Avenue.
2004-07-23	The Struggle to Get Europeans To Do Their Duty and Spend	Anna Ficon spent a couple of hours on a recent Saturday afternoon dodging intermittent showers and trolling the stores on Cologne's busy Hohestrasse for a pair of summer shoes. There was a pair of white sandals for 50 euros, or about $60. But, even in summer sale season, they had not been marked down.
2004-07-21	$25 AND UNDER; An Evening in Istanbul at an East Village Address	''I'M here for the belly dancer, but I might order some food,'' a middle-aged woman declared to the host, as she hoisted herself onto a bar stool at Maia on Avenue B. We would wager that she did. There are many enticing mezes at this Turkish meyhane (literally, ''wine house''), and they are presented to your table on a tray the size of a tractor tire. But the diner's switched priorities were a clue that something else is going on at this deep, bar-along-the-left restaurant. Many of the city's ambitious ethnic eateries turn out authentic dishes, but a few like Maia attempt to go further, to recreate the larger cultural chemistry of a successful watering hole back home -- the refreshment, but also the music, the dance and the social intercourse.
2004-07-21	A French Soul, Wrapped in a Picket Fence	A TALL maple tree shades the Brooklyn backyard of Ici, a sweet new restaurant full of unpretentious pleasures. One of them is that broad canopy of leaves, under which I dined on a recent night. It filtered the last rays of sunlight and shimmied in a slight summer breeze, accentuating the feeling of calm that Ici weaves. I lifted my gaze to the darkening sky; I lifted a glass of a bracing southern Italian white wine to my lips. I was happy. When the food came, it prolonged and even deepened that spell. There was arugula at the start, and it is hard to imagine that it could have been fresher, or more sensibly dressed. A hint of bitter lemon clung to the greens. A diffuse sheen of olive oil tempered the lemon's bite. These ingredients and flavors were more like suggestions than outright presences, diffident stagehands rather than histrionic scene stealers. A salad can be produced with much more fanfare -- this one added fennel and grana Padano cheese to the mix -- but that does not make it any better.
2004-07-18	Genteel Upstart	IN the sun-bleached crush of resorts that make up Long Beach Island, Beach Haven stands out. The southernmost of the island's five free-standing boroughs (the rest is the discontinuous Long Beach Township), it also has the strongest links to history. It was here, in the blossoming mercantile decades after the Civil War, that the gilded families of New York and Philadelphia helped make the long summer vacation the way of life it is today. They would disembark from the old Manahawkin & Long Beach Railroad, their servants lugging ''steamer trunk after steamer trunk after steamer trunk,'' as Jeanette Lloyd, the borough's unofficial historian, put it in an interview the other day. Horse-drawn trolleys would haul them to the graceful, sprawling clapboard hotels and Victorian cottages whose survivors (about 80 buildings) now make up the borough's proud historic district.
2004-07-07	$25 AND UNDER; A Taste of Haiti, Fiery and Fresh	AT Kombit, the new Haitian restaurant perched between Park Slope and Prospect Heights in Brooklyn, there are two kinds of customers: those who know and love piklis, and those who unwittingly scorch their tongues tasting it for the first time. The Haitian sisters who run the place -- Denise, Maryse and Pascale Félix -- are quick to coach newcomers about this fiery condiment. ''Piklis comes with everything fried,'' Pascale Félix explained, pointing to a ramekin of seemingly harmless cabbage-carrot slaw and advising caution. It is hotter than Hades with Scotch bonnets, but cut through the fried appetizers with bright bursts of fresh flavor. Halfway into my meal, I had to have more.
2004-07-04	Serving Up Minimalism	A restaurant named for a politician? What is the world coming to? For some time, the trend in restaurant names has been toward snappy and cryptic -- Red, Dish, Babbo, Vong. Now comes Frank's Waterside, six months old, proudly proclaiming its origins in an actual person and an actual place. How old-fashioned. The waterside, of course, is the west bank of the Hudson River. Frank is Frank R. Lautenberg, the junior senator from New Jersey. The principal owner, Scot Heagney, a local developer who is a friend of Mr. Lautenberg, is a novice restaurateur, but he had the good sense to reach out to an experienced and talented cook to serve as executive chef and managing partner: Sam Mickail, who for 12 years ran the excellent Terrace restaurant atop Columbia University in Upper Manhattan.
2004-07-01	Two Banks Figure Into Rescue of United	The fate of United Airlines rests largely in the hands of its bankers at J.P. Morgan Chase. Now that the government has firmly rejected United's request for more than $1 billion in loan guarantees, the airline will be asking its bankers at J.P. Morgan and Citigroup to fill the gap. The spotlight will shine brightest on J.P. Morgan, which has a history of rescuing companies viewed by the financial markets as hopeless cases, namely Lucent and Xerox. More recently, it was hired to arrange $8 billion loan to finance the exit from bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications, whose executives are on trial for accounting fraud.
2004-06-23	$25 AND UNDER; Make a Meal Out of Bar Food (Sake Bar, That Is)	NEW YORK'S restaurant entrepreneurs come in all sizes. Usually the big ones get all the attention, whether Jean-Georges Vongerichten's latest extravaganza in the Time Warner Center, Steve Hanson's opening of yet another money machine or Danny Meyer's coming Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. But what of the smaller entrepreneurs, whose omnipresent hustling fades into the background, like the last 800 channels on the 1,000-channel cable spectrum?
2004-06-23	Make a Meal Out of Bar Food (Sake Bar, That Is)	Chibitini, a sake bar that serves small plates of food, is as diminutive as its name, seating only about 20 people in a small, slender room.
2004-06-16	$25 AND UNDER; Brooklyn Pizza With a Résumé	THERE is something refreshingly simple about a restaurant named after a real person. At Franny's, on Flatbush Avenue, that person is a cheery young woman with loose black curls busing tables, rushing food out of the open kitchen and stopping to chat. ''The sugar snap peas are amazing,'' Franny -- Francine Stephens -- said one evening. And they were, with Parmesan and balsamic vinegar.
2004-06-06	Intra-Asian Fusion	BABY corn seemed pretty exotic 40 years ago, but in late middle age it has become the sort of ingredient that self-respecting Asian restaurants shun: canned, pale, tired and tasteless except for a certain metallic sweetness. At least, that is how I thought of it until I took the first bite of my first appetizer at Dragonel. This six-month-old restaurant bills itself as Indo-Chinese, and there's a story there. But first, the baby corn. It is one of many dishes that send Dragonel's menu glancing off at odd and delightful new angles, like a four-way bank shot on a pool table. Dipped in cornstarch, deep-fried and then tossed with a chili sauce supercharged with ginger and scallions and hoisin, it offers a full meal's worth of flavors and textures.
2004-06-06	Q and A	Car Rental Insurance Q.The bank that issued my MasterCard recently refused a claim for minor rental car damage because I had rented the car for more than two weeks. The bank's consumer representative said that to claim credit card insurance on car rentals, I would need to rent a different car every two weeks. Is this standard policy on most credit cards? -- Mary Anne Zak, Suffield, Conn. A. If you're planning to decline a car rental agency's collision damage waiver and use the insurance offered by your credit card company, it's a good idea to read the fine print. All major cards limit the length of time they will insure a rental vehicle. Most MasterCards will not cover rentals beyond 15 consecutive days (31 days with the World MasterCard); at Visa, coverage is limited to 15 consecutive days for rentals in the United States and 30 days in most other countries.
2004-05-23	A Big Fish in Any Pond	SPARKILL is the little town that time forgot, a sliver of a hamlet wedged between the Palisades and the broad, muddy creek that feeds the Hudson River. Five minutes north of the Bergen County line, it has the sleepy, ungentrified air of a mill town much farther upstate. It will never have the cachet, or the foot traffic, of its soigné riverfront neighbors Nyack and Piermont. So how, you may ask, did it land an astounding restaurant like Relish? The answer seems to lie in the energy and uncompromising vision of its owners, Michael Gross and Stacey Cretekos. A husband-and-wife team of former chefs (he did Asian and natural foods, she did pastry), they moved from Brooklyn to Rockland County a few years ago, hoping to start a restaurant. A year ago, they opened Relish in a shed-shaped former diner that had started life, in the 1920's, as an A.&P.
2004-05-16	Card Seem at Risk? Try a Stunt Double	AFTER days of searching the Internet, Gen Tanabe of Palo Alto, Calif., found the rare 19th-century memoir he wanted to buy for his father for Christmas last year. But he had no intention of giving the Web site his credit card number. ''The site looked like it might have been run by a teenager in a back room,'' said Mr. Tanabe, who writes books about college planning and financial aid. ''I didn't know how secure it was, or what they would do'' with the number.
2004-05-09	New American Remade	John, I just want to say thanks. It was you our waiter at Tassert's one rain-soaked Saturday evening -- who absorbed the news that I'd miscounted our party in making my reservation. After you seated us at a table for four, I realized that I'd invited two extra guests. Not only did you find a bigger table in the rapidly filling dining room; you advised us, with as much good humor as was possible under the circumstances, that we'd have to eat rapidly, because another group would claim our table in 90 minutes. And then, when those patrons arrived and we still hadn't ordered dessert, you found our wandering party yet a third table. It was grace under pressure, John. So this restaurant review belongs to you.
2004-05-02	Pan-Asian in Hampton Bays	MATSULIN quietly took root in Hampton Bays over the winter. This pan-Asian restaurant, whose name means pine woods, offers several cuisines: Chinese, Japanese, Malaysian, Thai and Vietnamese, bolstered by a few dishes from Singapore. The staff is as diverse as the food. The owners are Malaysian, the sushi chef from Japan and other chefs from Hong Kong and Malaysia. The dining room crew was sweet and accommodating, even remembering second-timers by name and recalling their food preferences. On a blustery, early spring, mid-week meal, when the restaurant was nearly empty, service was exceptionally attentive and concerned. On a busy Saturday with tables filled with many large parties, some of the niceties fell by the wayside. That night the table was never wiped off between courses. But the kitchen was still speedy and the busy busgirl topped off water glasses every few minutes.
2004-04-25	A Bistro Is Born	AS full-body makeovers go, this one is as impressive as anything on reality television. Harvest occupies land that has held a restaurant at least since the Great Depression. In recent years, though, the place went through a succession of names and owners, grew increasingly forlorn and finally acquired the runaway weeds and plywood boards that in northern Bergen County are almost inevitable harbingers of high-priced new housing. Then along came Russell Stern, an office-supply executive from neighboring Haworth; his wife, Meryl; and his brother, Mark. They bought the tumbledown old roadhouse, bulldozed it, and executed a feat of suburban renewal that deserves a spot on some sort of national register.
2004-04-18	A Pedigreed Spot in Wantagh	THE dishes that emanate from the kitchen at Snaps, a new restaurant in Wantagh, reflect a kaleidoscope of cuisines. The diversity on the menu is a result of Scott Bradley's experiences in a number of Long Island and Manhattan restaurants. Mr. Bradley, the chef and owner of Snaps, was executive chef at Passion Fish in Woodbury, Mirepoix in Glen Head and La Coquille in Manhasset. He also cooked at Blake's Bistro in Woodmere, Enoteca in Locust Valley, Tupelo Honey in Sea Cliff, Bruzell's in Great Neck and Barney's in Locust Valley. The places in Manhattan where he sharpened his skills would be found on anyone's ''A'' list : Daniel, Oceana, Aureole, the River Cafe, One if by Land, Two if by Sea and the Park Avenue Cafe. The arresting menu at Snaps reads like the cover of a greatest hits album. An appetizer short rib-Gorgonzola quesadilla rubs shoulders with an Asian-inspired crisp duck salad. At entree time, diners find a Moroccan-style braised lamb shank listed alongside steak braciola and a myriad of creative fish preparations.
2004-04-11	Kosher With a Kick	UPSCALE glatt kosher? The concept strikes even Google as curious: searching a zillion Web pages, it returned a grand total of nine hits. Yet here in a back alley of the Millburn Mall, a timeworn shopping center anchored by a chain pharmacy with part of its electric sign on strike (look for the DRUG FA), a 15-month-old restaurant called Mosaica is dispensing that very thing. Glatt is a Yiddish word for ''smooth,'' and it refers to the elevated level of health required in animals to be used for meat -- and, by extension, to a wide array of rigorous sanitary practices. (Roughness in the animals' lungs might indicate disease.) To ensure that a kosher establishment meets those standards, rabbis from a local supervisory council pay frequent unannounced visits, like restaurant critics. And diners who want to bring their own wine are politely advised that it must be not only kosher but also labeled ''mevushal,'' meaning pasteurized before fermentation.
2004-04-04	Mr. Li and the Good Life	LOST and hungry is a bad combination. But we're both and we're in two cars, hoping to converge for dinner. The cellphone rings. ''Where is it,'' she says, with a bit of New York steel in her voice, but we don't know. We're not there yet and, finally, when we do see it, we nearly miss the turn. New China is like that. The restaurant, with its reasonably priced authentic specialties, deserves broader appreciation. But it's the kind of place you don't see until a friend opens your eyes.
2004-03-30	American Express to Issue Cards in China	American Express announced last night that one of China's largest banks would begin issuing its credit cards later this year, significantly expanding Chinese consumers' access to United States credit cards. Only last month, Citibank began issuing credit cards in China, working with the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, in which it owns a 5 percent stake.
2004-03-21	Not for the Multi-Tasker	''UNIQUE'' is not an adjective I like to throw around, but Wazwan@Santoor appears to qualify on at least two counts. Its owners, Bal and Sarita Kaul, say it is the only authentic Kashmiri restaurant in the United States. That may sound like hyperbole, but after a Web search and an e-mail exchange with a ranking ethnic-food expert, Jim Leff of Chowhound.com, I can find no evidence to refute it. Beyond that, Wazwan is unquestionably the only Kashmiri restaurant on the planet owned and operated by an eminent toxicologist. Bal Kaul (pronounced cowl), a slight and courtly man in his early 60's, came to the Midwest from India as a medical student, earned a Ph.D. in pharmacology and for two decades held high positions in the health departments of New Jersey and New York City. He ran the world's largest anti-lead-poisoning program and patented tests for illicit drugs that are still in use today.
2004-03-07	Got Breath Mints?	VINE VALLEY, a cheerful two-year-old Lebanese restaurant at the fast-beating heart of the Middle Eastern community that straddles the border of Paterson and Clifton, has three defining characteristics. The first is the vine, about which more in a minute. The second is garlic. The third is smoke. Not cigarette smoke; some diners do indulge, but the ventilation system keeps that irritant to a minimum. The smoke that drifts around during a long, otherworldly meal here is a delicious compound from two sources: the grill in the kitchen, and what the menu calls ''argileh.''
2004-03-06	MasterCard Says Loss Widens 30%	MasterCard Inc., the world's second-biggest credit-card brand, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter loss widened 30 percent, to $67.1 million, as it took charges to settle lawsuits. The company reported pretax charges of $763 million for the full year related to the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Wal-Mart Stores and other merchants, as well as contract disputes, MasterCard said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. About $42 million of the charges came in the fourth quarter.
2004-03-03	$25 AND UNDER; A Crackling Glow of Welcome in Carroll Gardens	ANY neighborhood would love to have a restaurant that feels as warm and inviting as Chestnut, but Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, is the lucky winner. As you step inside, a little bar, practically glowing like a crackling fire, welcomes you like an old friend. I waited there one evening for friends. A glass of pilsner was expertly poured, and as I nibbled on the crisp house-made potato chips and drank in the happy buzz in the small, attractive dining room, a feeling of well-being overtook me. It stayed with me as we took our seats. All the materials in the dining room convey a sense of the natural: wood planks and wrought iron, brick and slate, copper tubing and candles, unfinished beams. The lighting flatters and the menu entices.
2004-02-29	In Dumpling Heaven	IF I were a singer and my friends and family can tell you than I am not -- I would sing a song of dumplings at Shanghai Park. Soft and yielding, tender on the outside, succulent on the inside with a rich hot broth that spills yet another layer of flavor into your mouth, these little treats are worth the drive, all by themselves, and I could eat only them for many a meal before I wished for something else. But then I would miss other delights, culinary and not, at Shanghai Park, which occupies a nondescript storefront along a gritty stretch of Route 27 where the population turns dense and towns begin to meld into the borders of other towns and houses begin to stack on top of other houses along this feeder chute to Manhattan.
2004-02-22	The Real Deal	DESPITE his fancy triple-barreled name, Anthony David Pino is a Jersey guy to the soles of his feet. He grew up in Medford Lakes, in the Pine Barrens, he and his grade-school buddies keeping a wary eye out for the Jersey Devil. His father was a jack-of-all-trades, his mother an accomplished home cook. Now 34, Mr. Pino says he knew from an early age that he wanted to run a restaurant. Small wonder that when he opened one it was in Hoboken, a town that would be utterly out of place in any other state. (Hoboken, Conn.? Hoboken, Ohio? Please.) A compact, outgoing man with an all-purpose Jersey accent and a morning-to-midnight work ethic, he took an old corner store on a gentrifying brownstone block and turned its mission from shoes to food -- first as a deli and then, in September 2002, as a full-fledged restaurant.
2004-02-08	The Pornography Industry vs. Digital Pirates	THOUSANDS of Web sites are putting Playboy magazine's pictures on the Internet -- free. And Randy Nicolau, the president of Playboy.com, is loving it. ''It's direct marketing at its finest,'' he said. Let the music industry sue those who share files, and let Hollywood push for tough laws and regulations to curb movie copying. Playboy, like many companies that provide access to virtual flesh and naughtiness, is turning online freeloaders into subscribers by giving away pictures to other sites that, in turn, drive visitors right back to Playboy.com.
2004-02-04	$25 AND UNDER; Old-Style Dominican Food Gets the Nuevo Treatment	IT didn't take long to realize that something was unusual about Bohio, a friendly new Dominican restaurant in Washington Heights that promises ''Viejo Latino'' cuisine with a stylish twist. On my first visit, I asked for a cafe con leche, a drink that is about as viejo as you can get. ''No cafe con leche,'' the waiter said. ''We only have espresso.''
2004-02-01	Personal Business; For Some Taxpayers, the Refund Is in the Plastic	THIS tax season, consumers can choose another way to receive their refunds: on plastic. Instead of waiting for refund checks to arrive, taxpayers can have their refunds loaded onto ''stored value,'' or prepaid, cards. Some tax preparation services are offering the cards to their customers, and some workers who already receive their wages on prepaid cards may be able to have their refunds deposited on them, too.
2004-01-31	Democrats Assail, and Tap, 'Special Interests'	The Democratic presidential hopefuls have been crossing the country this week promising to drive ''special interests'' and ''influence peddlers'' out of the White House. But campaign finance reports show some contenders benefit significantly from the lobbyists and special interests that they attack.
2004-01-30	Deal to Let MBNA Issue American Express Cards	American Express said yesterday that it had reached a deal to have its cards issued by MBNA, the country's second-largest credit card issuer, making its first foray into the Visa and MasterCard networks in the United States. But the agreement hinges on a two-year-old court decision that Visa and MasterCard are appealing. For now, the card networks' bylaws prevent their members from issuing cards by rivals, including American Express and Discover Financial Services, a unit of Morgan Stanley.
2004-01-30	BUSINESS DIGEST	Grand Jury Is Investigating Founder of Strong Funds The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, has convened a grand jury to consider evidence against Richard S. Strong, left, founder of Strong Capital Management, according to people briefed on the proceedings. The grand jury has been hearing evidence for several weeks about short-term trades made by Mr. Strong in mutual funds managed by his company. The investigation has cast a cloud over Mr. Strong's attempts to sell his majority stake in the company. [Page C3.]
2004-01-29	The Super Spots Lighten Up, At $2.3 Million For 30 Seconds	Twenty years after the Super Bowl first became as big a day for advertising as it is for professional football, Madison Avenue is gearing up for what looks to be a cheerier, somewhat sillier and certainly more expensive version of the annual midwinter festival of commercialism. The Ad Bowl within Super Bowl XXXVIII, to be broadcast on Sunday by CBS, will be infused with oversize servings of ingredients like humor, schmaltz, special effects and anthropomorphic animals.
2004-01-28	$25 AND UNDER; Two Blocks From Park Avenue, a Barbecue Pit	IT is not by accident that great barbecue has achieved the status of myth among passionate devotees unlucky enough to live far from the barbecue belt. No other genre of food has spawned as powerful a set of tale-tellers, regaling their audiences with pungent accounts of slow-cooked meat imbued with the scent of wood smoke. Indeed, all the best barbecue literature takes the form of a quest. You can practically hear the lyres a-strumming as the seekers triumph over challenges and obstacles in pursuit of the tender objects of their desire. As much as anybody, Robert Pearson should understand the mythic nature of great barbecue. Back in 1992, when he opened his first New York restaurant, Stick to Your Ribs in Long Island City, Queens, he said, ''All the best barbecue places that I've been to south of the Mason-Dixon line were on the wrong side of the tracks.''
2004-01-27	American Express Profit Rose 12% for 4th Quarter and 2003	The American Express Company said yesterday that its earnings rose 12 percent in the fourth quarter and the year, driven by greater spending and borrowing on its payment cards as well as more investment activity. ''We delivered record results for the full year as well as the fourth quarter and are in an excellent position to capitalize on an improving economy as we enter 2004,'' Kenneth I. Chenault, American Express's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
2004-01-25	SoHo Without Funk	ON a glistening moonlit night in midwinter, downtown Chatham put me in mind of that Norman Rockwell painting of Stockbridge, Mass., at Christmastime: prosperous, peaceable and frozen in time, circa 1957. Driving down Main Street, I half-expected to find myself in a regatta of tailfinned DeSotos and wood-paneled Ford station wagons, each one populated by a mom, a dad, a flop-eared spaniel and 2.2 perfect children. In the real world of 2004, of course, the vehicle demographics run more to Lexuses and Lincoln Navigators. But Chatham still feels like the quintessential small town of our nostalgic dreams. So eyebrows must have gone up last March when Eric Daley opened Salsa Chatham, a Southwestern restaurant in a storefront that once held a deli, its awning a nearly lurid blood-red.
2004-01-16	For Credit Card Holders, New Terms and New Complications	Another bank merger, another transfer of plastic in your wallet. For many consumers who have witnessed one bank after the other combine, this era of merging and purging is familiar. Now, it is just a matter of time before credit card customers of J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One are sent new cards -- that is, after the companies do market research to determine which one has the stronger brand.
2004-01-11	Now It's Italian Fare for a Landmark	I DON'T know what it is about some restaurant locations. The new Belmare in New Canaan is a classic example. Located in a highly visible, venerable building (the former Veterans Hall) with towering entrance columns, directly across from town hall and next door to the firehouse, it should be an ideal spot for a restaurant, especially as it is on a street chockablock with places to eat. Yet this building has been a steady revolving door of restaurants, some very good, all better than average. What gives? Maybe the problem is that the building is set back a few feet from the street and up several steps. Maybe because the building is such a longtime landmark of the town, people no longer ''see'' it.
2004-01-11	Fanfare for Flavors	A NEW species has been sighted in this Navesink River town, beached up on sautéed spinach in a little restaurant called Le Fandy. It is the cinnamon-crusted monkfish, and biologists say it represents yet another evolutionary turn in Monmouth County dining, until recently best known for lumbering Pleistocene creatures like the deep-fried clam strip and the leaden flounder fillet. Martin Plastiak, 28, Le Fandy's chef and co-owner, spent two years in the kitchen of Le Bernardin, that temple of haute seafood in Midtown Manhattan, before striking out on his own and opening Le Fandy in late 2002. The monkfish dish is his own creation, derived from a five-spice preparation that he learned in the Bernardin sauce line.
2004-01-07	$25 AND UNDER; Fast Food From Ukraine, in the Village at Last	OF all the world's great powers, Russia is by far the most underrepresented culinarily in New York. The reasons for this seem obvious: Decades of dictatorship, along with the prevailing public image of a drab, pleasureless society, were not good restaurant marketing tools. Except for a few temples of czarist excess, the cuisine of Russia and its neighboring nations was largely restricted to banquet halls in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, where the primary purpose of the food was to make the vodka go down easier. This is all changing rapidly. With the fall of the Soviet Union came a loosening on emigration, which provided the critical mass of cooks and mouths needed to open all sorts of new restaurants. Most, like the Uzbeki places that dot Kew Gardens and Forest Hills in Queens, cater to other immigrants. Few have made it into Manhattan.
2003-12-29	Paying the Rent by Credit Card, and Dreaming of Bora Bora	Once a month, tens of thousands of New Yorkers write four- and even five-figure checks to their landlords. As they do so, some gnash their teeth over having to write such large checks for such small spaces. Others complain that they receive no tax breaks or equity, the way homeowners do. Would they feel better if their rent payments earned them a free trip to Waikiki?
2003-12-20	Final Pact Approved in Long-Running Debit Card Litigation	The nation's retailers received final approval yesterday of a $3 billion settlement with Visa USA and MasterCard International, which will lead to substantial reductions in certain transaction fees. The settlement, which was approved by Judge John Gleeson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, resolved a six-year-old class-action lawsuit brought by the retailers that accused the two card networks of using their dominance in credit cards to force merchants to accept their debit cards as well, despite less-expensive debit processing offered by competitors.
2003-12-14	All in the Family	RYAN DEPERSIO is just 25, but it is clear that he was born to run a restaurant. It is clear not just from the walloping success of Fascino, his five-and-a-half-month-old, 55-seat venture on Bloomfield Avenue here, but from the constant, warming presence of his entire family. Mr. DePersio, a compact and outgoing man with a cheery, open, made-for-television face, is the chef. His mother, Cynthia, is the pastry chef, and his father, Anthony, is a co-owner. Ryan's brother, also named Anthony, is the manager and headwaiter. In the course of a long and abundant evening, you can expect at least three of the four to visit your table. By the end, you are likely to feel like a DePersio yourself.
2003-11-30	A Blend of Cuisines With a Hint of Thai	THE Papaya Thai and Asian BBQ restaurant in South Norwalk -- directly across from the Maritime Center -- resembles a W. Somerset Maugham version of Asia: three intimate and festive dining rooms, with bamboo bird cages as hanging lamps, a thatched nipa hut roof over the bar and the ornately carved wooden wall plaques of Southeast Asian scenes. The owners, who also run the Plum Tree, a very good Japanese restaurant in New Canaan, have obviously spent a fortune on the décor and on an elaborate menu that tries to bridge two cuisines that are basically not compatible: Thai and Japanese.
2003-11-30	Gem of an Inn Warmed by Banked Fires	DINING recently at the Bird and Bottle Inn, a pedigreed hostelry with enormous physical charm, I felt as if I had been unwillingly cast in a restoration comedy, the sort of farcical drama in which characters with names like Mistress Flummery and Mr. Botchit conspire to make a mockery of propriety. It was a play in which offers of wine were rescinded, forks found no replacements, and water glasses stood empty for excruciatingly long intervals. Service on my initial visit was inept to the point of hilarity; my waiter could not answer the simplest questions about the food and wine, and to make matters worse, covered for his ineptitude with buffoonery.
2003-11-26	A Holiday Ride From The Internet To the Table	SHOPPING for gifts of food online has become as sophisticated as catalog shopping and much more convenient. The pictures on Web sites have become more enticing than those on paper, even glossy paper. Browsing the sites is as easy as turning pages, and if you have questions, the best sites have someone at the other end of the phone. The only reason not to shop online for food is fear that it might not taste good, so I've done the tasting for you. I have been out for the last year hunting for the best of everything, including some not so easy to find specialties: buttery, lightly smoked wild salmon; tender, full-flavored steaks that come from grass-fed beef; and barbecued brisket that is smoky but tender and moist.
2003-11-16	New Cooks Settle In at a Familiar Site	WHEN the French restaurant Tartine vacated its Westport location in secluded Sconset Square, I regretted the loss. But in its place, Blue Lemon has surfaced, and it has its own charm, character and insouciance. At first glance, I was not enchanted by the eclectic modern American menu, which seems to have a little of everything. ''Are they trying too hard?'' I wondered. But the lunch that followed, as well as two later dinners, convinced me that my question was irrelevant.
2003-11-09	Ethnic With a Small 'e'	ON THE EDGE of this trip-back-in-time, red-brick-and-sandstone Colonial hamlet on the Bergen County border is a road sign reading ''Restaurant Row.'' This is something of a misnomer: though five fairly ambitious restaurants are scattered about town, the only row is a pair of adjoining storefronts in a new strip mall. The older one is Barcelona, a sophisticated Spanish-Cuban place reviewed in this space in January 2002. Its neighbor, the trim, Mediterranean-accented Village Grille, celebrated its first birthday last August. To judge from the turnout on two recent weekends, the Village Grille is more than holding up its half of Restaurant Row. And to judge from the cooking, it has more than a little unrealized potential.
2003-10-26	Lost in Column A and B For Authenticity, and Adventure,	IN the lobby of Hunan Cottage is a blackboard, and on the blackboard are columns of Chinese characters. Presumably they are today's specials, but all I can read are the numbers at the foot of each column: $16.95, $22.95, $32.95. I ask a waiter to translate. His responses are cryptic: ''Lobster. Crab. Soup.'' He smiles, shrugs, walks away. It feels like one of those surreal recurring dreams that signal anxiety or frustration (or just plain hunger). The feelings are compounded by the printed menus we are handed -- a list of dishes as dull and predictable as the restaurant's generic name and its featureless décor. There are egg rolls and won-ton soup, chow mein and spare ribs, orange flavor this and General Tsao's that.
2003-10-17	Cellular Phone Company Gains by Thinking Small	Without sitting through a job interview or even submitting a résumé, Jessica Gazo has found a job as part of a new long-range sales team at the Philippine cellular operator Smart Communications. Ms. Gazo, a 33-year-old housewife who lives 600 miles south of Manila in Davao City, is one of more than 100,000 mobile phone users who re-sell Smart's cellular services through a new prepaid service called Smart Buddy e-Load. With a special, $20 chip for her mobile phone, Ms. Gazo can transfer bits of air time to her friends' and acquaintances' phones -- as little as 30 pesos worth (about 55 cents).
2003-10-08	$25 AND UNDER; Based Loosely on a Traditional Tale From Greece	FEW genres are as frustrating to me as the moderately priced Greek restaurant. I love Greek food, maybe too well. Each year, predictably around spring, I begin to crave Greek food in its modest taverna form -- lively grilled fish and roasted meats, zesty dips and salads, perhaps a bowl of tiny fried fish or octopus, seasoned simply with little more than good olive oil and lemon juice. So begins a season of disappointment, as invariably in recent years I have been confronted with overcooked seafood, tired dips and greasy meats. Worst of all is the cynicism of so many restaurants, which think they can get by with the same cookie-cutter menu, the dreary blue-and-white maritime décor, the obligatory display of fish on ice, the endless bazouki music out of ''Zorba,'' with maybe a free glass of ouzo thrown in to help digest the fakery.
2003-10-05	Pan-Asian, but Not Fusion	RESTAURANTS that call themselves Pan-Asian leave diners in the dark. Pan-Asian can mean at least two things: that the food is fusion, combining the ingredients and techniques from various cuisines within one dish; or that selections like pad Thai, Indonesian pancake, beef teriyaki and Hong Kong pan-fried noodles, are available on the same menu. Shangri-La of Asia in Garden City Park falls into the second category. All those examples were taken from its menu. The staff is as international as the food. The owner is Chinese but runs a number of Thai restaurants: Lemon Leaf in Hicksville and Carle Place and Pad Thai in Oakdale. There are two chefs: one Thai, the other Cantonese. The members of the dining room staff that we encountered were Indonesian. Those servers were sweet, caring, knowledgeable and speedy.
2003-10-01	$25 AND UNDER; A Seafood Shack That Lets Classics Be Classic	THIS city is full of bad ideas for restaurants. One of them was That Bar, a kitschy place in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, with the equally kitschy conceit of serving brunch at all times. Not surprisingly, That Bar lasted only about That Long. The good news is that people can sometimes learn from their mistakes. After That Bar went under, three of the former partners took over the Smith Street space. Taking the measure of this restaurant-saturated neighborhood in an effort to see what it lacked, they came up with Pier 116, an urban take on the simple seafood shacks that dot the northeastern coast. The heart of Brooklyn not being the ideal place for a seasonal venture, Pier 116 also has a bright dining room and bar to complement its backyard beer garden.
2003-09-25	Fired McCann executive gets back in the game with a newly created senior post at Euro RSCG.	JAMES R. HEEKIN, fired in February from his posts atop the problem-plagued McCann-Erickson World Group in New York, is returning to advertising. Mr. Heekin, 54, will take a newly created job: president and chief operating officer at Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York.
2003-09-23	American Express To Seek Banks As Card Partners	The American Express Company, encouraged by a recent court ruling, said yesterday that it would begin pursuing partnerships with United States banks that belong to Visa and MasterCard networks. The company expects to have the first of these agreements signed within a year, Kenneth I. Chenault, its chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ''There is a strong interest among banks to partner with us in the U.S., just as they have internationally,'' he said.
2003-09-22	Caught in the Credit Card Vise	''I'm still paying for groceries I bought for my family years ago,'' said Julie Pickett. She meant it literally. Mrs. Pickett and her husband, Jerry, of Middletown, Ohio, are trapped in the iron grasp of credit card debt. Except for the fact that no one is threatening to damage their kneecaps, they're in the same dismal position as the classic victim of loan-sharking.
2003-09-21	Personal Business; Credit Card Rewards Turn From Nouns to Verbs	FOR years, credit card companies have tried to bolster their business by offering rewards programs loaded with things that cardholders can get with membership points -- plane tickets and hotel rooms, fancy luggage and watches, even cash rebates on purchases. But lately the focus has been on experiences over things. For 95,000 rewards points, American Express will send a personal chef to a card holder's home to share some culinary techniques and prepare a meal for nine. For 60,000 points, someone who carries a Citibank Diamond Preferred Rewards card can glide in a hot-air balloon over the vineyards of Napa Valley, before touching down for a catered picnic that offers some of the region's best wines. Last year, a Diners Club member exchanged 90,624 points for a pair of tickets to the annual New Year's Eve gala at the Casino Ballroom on Catalina Island in California.
2003-09-18	Credit Card Ruling Upheld	Visa International Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. cannot bar 34,000 member banks from distributing credit cards in the United States that were issued by two rivals, the American Express Company and Morgan Stanley, a federal appeals court said yesterday. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, upheld a ruling by a lower court in a case brought two years ago by the Justice Department.
2003-09-17	$25 AND UNDER; When There's Only One of a Chain	I usually avoid places like Chipotle Mexican Grill, which opened last month on 44th Street, near Third Avenue. It belongs to a chain partly owned by McDonald's. That places it squarely among the forces that are ironing the country's quirky regional wrinkles into a smooth national uniform in which Anchorage equals Akron. Each franchise, whether restaurant, coffee shop or drugstore, arrives with focus groups, market surveys and other tools of bureaucracy, relentlessly homogenizing flavor and creativity. Regardless of how one feels about chains, this first Chipotle in New York City produces undeniably good food, including the last things I would expect: forceful spicing, fresh, good-quality ingredients and attention to details. What's more, while the components of Chipotle's burritos, fajitas and tacos are made in advance, they are assembled to order, a crucial element in the leap from sustenance to pleasure.
2003-09-11	Shares Fall Sharply After Tape of bin Laden Is Broadcast	Stocks had their biggest losses in five weeks yesterday after Osama bin Laden appeared in a videotape broadcast on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, raising concerns that there might be more assaults. Semiconductor shares including Intel led the decline after Texas Instruments issued a sales forecast that disappointed some investors.
2003-08-31	Shy? Not These Flavors	THE dishes at Thai Nam Phet are advertisements for themselves, as bright and vivid as the electrified blue-and-white signs that announce its name to the traffic on Route 46. As unlikely as it may seem, some of the best Thai food in the state is leaping off plates in this small, ordinary-looking restaurant on a dreary stretch of highway opposite a discount drugstore. The prices are gentle. The décor is forgettable. The seriousness of the enterprise is apparent only in the warm, somewhat formal welcome by a hostess in evening wear (she turns out to be a cousin of the owner, Samarn Pecharatubtim) and in this small-type manifesto at the bottom of the menu: ''We use only top quality chicken breasts, leanest beef and virtually fat-free pork in our preparations.'' And then those preparations start arriving, and the electricity moves indoors.
2003-08-24	When Debit Cards Get Training Wheels	I AM very controlling with my children. They don't like it much, but I offer no apologies. I want to know where they are, who they are with and what they are doing. I check on the movies they want to see, I go over their homework and, what bothers them the most, I ask them how they are spending their money. Teaching children about money is not easy, but considering how it will consume their lives, it is one of the most important lessons we'll teach them. The problem is, we're often not the best teachers. Our children know we go to work, but they really don't see us earn. They see us spending, but they don't see the bills come in. When we don't have the cash for something, they see us pull out our credit cards. It's like magic. And a horrible lesson.
2003-08-19	Lawyers Seek $609 Million Fee for Negotiating Deal for Retailers With Visa and MasterCard	After willingly working seven years without pay, the lawyers who negotiated a multibillion-dollar settlement with Visa and MasterCard on behalf of the nation's retailers asked for their paychecks yesterday. The lawyers, representing 30 firms led by Constantine & Partners in New York, are requesting $609 million, or about 18 percent of the settlement, plus $19 million in expenses.
2003-08-17	Call of the Census	THE first question one might have about Zoe's by the Lake is ''Where's the lake?'' The answer is that it is missing in action: drained away when a dam burst during an epochal rainstorm three years ago this month.
2003-08-15	Wall St. Shifts to Backups, But Much Commerce Halts	Wall Street was shutting down for the day when the lights went out from Lower Manhattan to the uptown towers that house the nation's biggest banks. But bonds were still trading in Chicago, where traders were initially unnerved by fears that the power failure was a result of terrorism. The blackout had a spotty effect on businesses in major cities across the Northeastern states and in Canada as companies struggled to recover. The difference between being up and running or sitting in the dark appeared to depend on how well a company had prepared to recover from disaster.
2003-08-10	A New Way to Bring Plastic to the People	Few teenagers have checking accounts, which often makes it difficult for them to cash checks on their own. So how, then, should you compensate young people in your neighborhood for doing chores like baby-sitting or mowing the lawn? Of course, you can always give them cash, but soon you may also be able to give them what's known as a ''stored value,'' or prepaid, card, and routinely deposit money into it from your checking account. The cards work much like standard gift cards but often have Visa or MasterCard logos, which means they can be used wherever those brands are accepted.
2003-08-10	Survival Tips For a World Of Low Rates	Here are some ways to help yourself in a world of low interest rates: Inflation-Proof Bonds A risk-free investment paying an annual return of almost 5 percent seems like a piece of 1990's history. But the Treasury Department makes that offer on its Web site and even guarantees that the return will never fall below inflation.
2003-08-09	MASTERCARD PROFIT FALLS 11% AS EXPENSES RISE	MasterCard Inc. said yesterday that second-quarter profit fell 11 percent as marketing and other expenses rose. Net income dropped to $32 million, or 32 cents a share, from $36 million, or 50 cents, in the quarter a year ago, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Revenue climbed 24 percent, to $557 million. Operating expenses climbed 28 percent, to $507 million, as MasterCard increased advertising spending. About 1,600 banks worldwide own MasterCard, which processes credit card transactions for its member banks.
2003-08-03	At a Familiar Spot, a Bistro Settles In	AS I walked into Pastorale Bistro & Bar in Lakeville, I had a sense that I had been on the premises before. As it turned out, I wasn't just imagining things. I really had been there, when it was called Charlotte and in a recent reincarnation as the Boxing Horse Bistro. The interior is much the same as before, though some of the walls are painted lemon-yellow, others are fiery-red and upstairs they are a mellow ochre.
2003-08-03	Bird Call	THE Black Duck on Sunset represents a considerable departure for Cape May dining, and a welcome one. Fond as I am of Cape May, it has a fussiness that can grow wearying, as when the owners of its splendiferous Victorian houses compete to match their paint jobs to the perfect lilies in their impeccable gardens. The culinary equivalent of such one-upmanship -- truffled this, pomegranate that -- can be found all over the menus of the high-toned New American restaurants for which Cape May is famous.
2003-08-01	Lower Fees on Debit Cards Fail to Satisfy Retailers	From delis to department stores, retailers have been eagerly awaiting today, when Visa and MasterCard will begin charging them less for some debit card transactions under court settlements reached in April. But Visa and MasterCard intend to give the steepest cuts, as much as 70 percent, to select merchants, while the price break for some will be less than 10 percent.
2003-07-16	Sears to Sell Card Portfolio To Citigroup For $3 Billion	Sears, Roebuck & Company agreed yesterday to sell its huge credit card portfolio to Citigroup, abandoning a business that it started to help spur sales during the Depression and that ended up becoming larger than its core retail operation. Citigroup, the largest credit card issuer in the nation, agreed to pay about $3 billion in cash for the portfolio, which includes Sears private-label cards and co-branded MasterCards.
2003-07-16	$25 AND UNDER; A Concentration on Seafood. After That, It's Diner's Choice.	SNACKBAR is the sort of restaurant that on paper I would be inclined to hate: loud and cynically fashionable, with distracted waiters and fake martinis by the pitcher. The restaurant even charges for bread. But open your mouth and start eating, and annoyance gives way to pleasure. Food so good retouches the experience. What seemed loud is now simply convivial. Cynically fashionable? More like striking. And the bread, $2.50 a basket, served with fine olive oil, has real character.
2003-07-13	A Card That's Picky About Who Can Charge	Not to be outdone by record-low interest rates on home mortgages and student loans, Capital One last week introduced a credit card with a fixed rate of 4.99 percent. The company says the card has the lowest fixed rate in the nation, excluding promotional rates that last only a few months. The 4.99 percent rate applies to both purchases and balances transferred from other credit cards. In addition, the new card has no annual fee and does not charge extra for cash advances or balance transfers.
2003-07-06	Sushi and Sashimi in an Upscale Setting	KU is a chic new Japanese restaurant in Cos Cob. Its long dining room is enhanced by a window at one end, a mirrored wall at the other, and an open kitchen on one side facing a wall with five narrow niches in which votive candles flicker. Upscale is the operative word, which was quickly apparent when our first appetizer arrived.
2003-07-06	For a Cornucopia of Clams and Oysters	A midsummer night's dream might be sipping Champagne and slurping oysters by moonlight. At the Fish Cellar in Mount Kisco, diners can settle into a lovely back patio and feast on bivalves from near and distant waters. If more is wanted, lobsters beckon, any size, any way. An assortment of chilled seafood could be just the ticket to cool off a sultry night. Whatever the choice, the fish is pristine, guaranteed by Joe DiMauro, the ''seller'' himself, whose nearby fish shop -- Mount Kisco Seafood -- sets the gold standard in the county for choice and freshness. Appropriate to the fare served here, the wine list is strong in whites, priced to suit all wallets. What languishes is the menu, which lists items like swordfish, linguini with an assortment of seafood marinara, seared rare tuna and crab cakes, the usual dishes available at many other dining spots. It's a pity that this restaurant hasn't snapped up and celebrated more of the exciting bounty that crams Mount Kisco Seafood's icy beds.
2003-06-29	A Nation of Grinders	We're at an odd cultural moment. There's no dominant image of business success. Neither dot-com millionaires nor the Wall Street whizzes seem alluring. The risk-taking, push-the-envelope executives no longer inspire confidence. The charismatic C.E.O.'s just seem like overplayed blowhards. And yet nobody gets inspired at the thought of being the safe, secure, highly anal Organization Man. So how about Abraham Lincoln as the defining capitalist figure for our age? As the Yuppie was to the 80's, as the dot-commer was to the 90's, maybe Abraham Lincoln could be for the coming decade. Not the great statesman Lincoln -- the president Lincoln -- but rather the middle-aged corporate-lawyer Lincoln, the guy who in the 1850's represented railroads and banks, the guy who traveled relentlessly around the legal circuit handling cases big and small, the guy who, when he made some money, added a second floor to his house so his family could have more space, the guy whose ambition, as his law partner famously said, knew no rest. That middle-aged Lincoln represents all the sometimes homely but invariably dreamy pushers who are what American striving is really all about.
2003-06-27	Laundering Of Billions Is Alleged	A Midtown financial corporation was indicted yesterday on charges of illegally transmitting at least $3 billion from shell companies, private investors and foreign exchange houses to offshore accounts, cheating the city, state and federal governments out of tens of millions of dollars in taxes in what prosecutors called the largest scheme of the sort to be uncovered in New York City. The corporation, Beacon Hill Service Corporation, which had offices on East 54th Street in Manhattan, shut down in February after officials from the Manhattan district attorney's office obtained a search warrant and found that the company had been illegally receiving and transferring billions of dollars abroad for years, prosecutors said. In 2001 and 2002, wire transfers from 4 of the company's 40 accounts totaled more than $3.2 billion, prosecutors said.
2003-06-19	Economic Scene; Vertical integration worked well in its day; now companies thrive by turning to specialists.	SEARS is selling its credit card division, almost certainly to a specialized financial business. To let customers charge their purchases, retailers no longer have to run their own credit operations. Dell Computer doesn't make its own hardware. It assembles circuit boards and disk drives from specialized manufacturers. From payroll management to movie special effects, vertical integration is out. Specialization is in.
2003-06-17	Credit Card Deal Has Initial Approval	MasterCard International Inc. and Visa International Inc. have won preliminary approval from a federal judge for their $3 billion agreement to settle a lawsuit by retailers over debit card fees. Judge John Gleeson of United States District Court in Brooklyn gave early approval to the pact on Friday, setting up a process for notifying merchants of the deal. Visa and MasterCard, the two biggest credit card companies, agreed in April to settle the antitrust suit, filed in 1996 by the merchants, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company.
2003-06-15	For Inventives Dishes, a Period Setting	STEPPING into the classic American dining rooms at Depuy Canal House, a former 18th-century tavern, many diners may be surprised -- and some thrilled -- by the distinctly unorthodox menu. Here, Hudson Valley foie gras is served with yucca custard, and Japanese eel arrives with Louisiana hot sauce. For more than 30 years, John Novi, the chef and owner, has been pairing fresh, local ingredients with the wild and the obscure. He bought the dilapidated stone building in the mid-1960's, rebuilt the place and within a decade his creative cuisine was being hailed as the dawn of New American Cooking. Over the years, he has honed that niche. Recent meals at the Depuy Canal House featured exquisite morels served with shallots and port wine, and Hudson River shad roe harvested that day by local fishermen.
2003-06-08	In From the Rain	IT was a drizzly Sunday evening in the gray procession that was May, and Le Petit Chateau, with its imitation French-farmhouse facade of dark beams and white stucco, looked worn and faintly dispirited. Inside, the welcome was warm but the dining room was dim and underpopulated. We wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. Then a waiter arrived with amuse-bouches, and the room lit up. They were tiny china cups of wild-mushroom cappuccino topped with foam and sprinkled with porcini powder. The soup itself was as far from standard cream of mushroom as late-summer tomatoes are from ''vine ripened'' -- an intense, vivid mix of flavors and textures that went straight to that part of the brain (the orbitofrontal cortex, I'm told) where such things are stored forever.
2003-06-06	BUSINESS DIGEST	European Central Bank Cuts Rates by Half a Point The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate half a percentage point. The decision, which was widely expected, was aimed at tempering the recent rise of the euro against the dollar and easing the pressure on European exporters, who fear that their goods are being priced out of the American market. Interest rates in Europe are at a level not seen there since at least World War II. But the president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, above, left the door open for further cuts.

2003-06-06	Merchants May Get Lump-Sum Payout in Debit Card Suit	The nation's retailers may receive money from the settlement of a lawsuit involving debit cards from Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard International sooner than they had expected, according to agreements announced yesterday. The original settlement plans, disclosed in April, called for payment of $3 billion over 10 years, but the retailers are allowed to look for a financial institution that would pay or raise the money immediately in exchange for the rights to the payments over the next decade, lawyers said yesterday.
2003-06-05	Tarnishing of Sosa's Image May Hurt His Income	The controversy surrounding Sammy Sosa and the corked bat he used in a game Tuesday night against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays may affect more than his place in baseball history. It could also end his multimillion-dollar product endorsement deals if companies seek to distance themselves from Sosa, a man who some analysts said yesterday could be forever tainted by allegations of wrongdoing. ''It has the potential to really devastate his earning potential when it comes to endorsements,'' said Jim Andrews, editorial director of the IEG Sponsorship Report, a newsletter that tracks corporate sponsorships and endorsements. ''The deciding factor will be, when the dust settles, whether the American public believes this was an accident or a one-time thing or whether they choose to believe that this is something that he has done before.''
2003-05-29	Surprise Jumps In Credit Rates Bring Scrutiny	The toughest diagnosis that Matthew Hajzl made last month was on his credit card statement. A doctor in Batavia, Ill., he discovered that the interest rate on his MasterCard had nearly tripled, to 16.99 percent from 6.2 percent. Dr. Hajzl asked the card issuer why, noting that he had always paid on time and kept within his credit limit.
2003-05-20	He Won't Discuss Money, but He Now Accepts Visa	LLOYD CONSTANTINE is not talking about money, no matter how many pestering efforts are made. An antitrust lawyer, he has just extracted $3 billion from Visa USA and MasterCard International in settling a lawsuit over their debit card policies. The head spins over the amount. He must have made a fortune. So Mr. Constantine, tell us: How much? But he has little to say on this. He says that he has yet to collect a cent, and that the money is not the most significant aspect of the case anyway.
2003-05-16	WACHOVIA SAYS CARD SETTLEMENT WILL REDUCE ITS PROFITS	The chief executive of Wachovia said yesterday that the settlement between Visa USA, MasterCard International and retailers over the use of debit cards would cut its profit this year by $25 million to $30 million. Wachovia, the fifth-biggest bank in the nation, may also have a $60 million decline in profit in 2004 because of changes associated with the deal, the executive, G. Kennedy Thompson, said. The agreement between the bank-owned credit card associations and merchants is likely to decrease the fees banks get from debit card transactions. Wachovia earned $1 billion in the first quarter.
2003-05-13	BUSINESS DIGEST	F.C.C. Prepares to Loosen Rules on Media Ownership The government proposed the most significant overhaul of its media ownership rules in a generation, including a change that would allow television networks to own enough local stations to reach 90 percent of the nation's viewers. That change is part of the package of proposals that officials said appeared to have the support of the Republican majority of the Federal Communications Commission, including Michael K. Powell, the chairman, above. [Page A1.]
2003-05-13	Company Sues MasterCard Over Fees for Online Sales	Paycom Billing Services, a company that processes credit card and check transactions for online merchants, sued MasterCard International yesterday, asserting that MasterCard violated antitrust laws and charged excessive fees. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, seeks at least $23 million in damages. It signals that Internet vendors might pursue their own antitrust accusations against the card network. Last month, MasterCard settled a class-action case brought by retailers, agreeing to pay $1 billion and to reduce its debit card fees, among other concessions. Visa USA, a co-defendant in the case, reached its own settlement two days later.
2003-05-11	Friendly Spot for Seafood Hits the Scene	IF you have any doubts about today's quirky economy, just check out the current restaurant scene, as so many places open with fanfare and disappear with nary a trace a short time later. At least with the Front Street Fish House & Cranky Fish Saloon in Bethel, part of the name remained from the restaurant (One Front Street) that was open for less than a year before changing its ownership, chef and menu.
2003-05-02	Settlement Is Seen As Changing Ways Consumers Use Debit Cards	The unexpected deals that Visa USA and MasterCard International made this week to settle a lawsuit over their fees are likely to restyle the robust market for debit cards, possibly reshaping where and how consumers can use them, industry experts said yesterday. For now, consumers will still be able to use debit cards carrying the Visa and MasterCard logos wherever Visa and MasterCard are accepted.
2003-05-01	Visa Reaches Settlement in Debit Card Case	Visa USA, facing a trial over its debit card fees, said last night that it had agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by retailers, two days after a similar deal was reached by MasterCard. Under the terms of the settlement, Visa will pay $2 billion to retailers and will reduce the fees it charges merchants on some debit card purchases, according to a person close to the retailers' legal team. MasterCard, under its settlement, agreed to pay $1 billion and also agreed to cut its fees, the company confirmed last night. Both will also pay $25 million immediately.
2003-04-29	MasterCard Settles Case With Retailers Ahead of Trial	MasterCard International reached an unexpected settlement yesterday with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and thousands of other retailers just as a multibillion-dollar lawsuit over its debit card policies was about to go to trial. That leaves Visa USA, the other defendant in the closely watched lawsuit, to argue the six-year-old case alone.

The companies -- America Online, Microsoft and Yahoo -- are calling for technical changes in the way e-mail is passed around cyberspace to make it easier to determine who really sent it and what it is about.

2003-04-28	Payments by Debit Card At Issue as Trial Begins	When consumers use debit cards to make purchases, they face a simple choice: to sign for the purchase or to punch in a personal identification number. Most consumers are scarcely aware that their decision is at the center of a large class-action lawsuit, starting trial today in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and pitting the nation's retailers against Visa and MasterCard. The dispute is over whether the card companies can compel merchants to accept their debit cards, which, when processed with signatures, have much more expensive service charges for the merchants than the PIN-based cards.
2003-04-27	Fill 'Er Up	FIFTEEN FOX PLACE doesn't serve liquor (except for a welcome nip of limoncello at the end of a long, long meal), but there is a delicious touch of the speakeasy about it -- a sense that only those who know the password can gain admission. Just finding it is a challenge. It is not in some throbbing downtown but on one of those neat, thickly settled blocks of aluminum- or vinyl-sided houses that have been home to generations of first- and second-generation Americans, first from Ireland and Italy, later from the Middle East and Korea and the Philippines. It looks like a private house, and that's what it is; only a small plaque by the front door identifies the restaurant's name, which is also, of course, its address. You have to ring the doorbell and hope that someone hears.
2003-04-27	Investing; Have Business Service Stocks Fallen Too Far?	SHARES of business services companies have suffered worse declines during the last year than many of the companies they serve. But some have fallen so far, analysts say, that they may start to look attractive as pieces of the economy pick up. From credit card processors to technology consultants, these companies, over all, have had a stock-price decline of nearly 28 percent in the last 52 weeks, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Services Index. That compares with a decline of 16.5 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
2003-04-27	A Bistro, Yes, With an American Twist	YOU might think Bistro du Soleil in South Norwalk suffers from an identity crisis: the name is French, the ownership is Colombian-Spanish and the food is eclectic American. As for the food, there is no crisis at all. Over all, it is well prepared, knowledgeable and mostly delicious -- although some dishes do not reach the table hot.
2003-04-21	Banks Offer Sweeteners To Paying Bills Online	These days, Rezz Shaikh says, he does not really mind paying his bills. Mr. Shaikh, an accountant from Parsippany, N.J., is taking advantage of a promotion from J. P. Morgan Chase that will give him $150 for authorizing the bank to take money out of his bank account electronically instead of writing checks. ''It's an excellent deal,'' he said, ''plus you're getting the benefit of paying online.''
2003-04-20	Candid Coffee	I HAVE nothing against Italian food; some of my best meals have been Italian. But in central New Jersey, I'm always looking for different places. New American has made considerable inroads; Thai has brought us spicy beef salad, chicken-coconut soup and sticky rice with mango. But not a lot of Middle Eastern food is available that is not takeout. That is why I was delighted to find Seven Hills of Istanbul, where the tables are clothed, the chef turns out beautifully roasted halal-prescribed meats and the Turkish coffee is so seductive that when you get home after dinner, you will have plenty of time to plan your next visit because you can't sleep anyway. Sure, you can get a cup of wimpy regular decaf. But why bother when the real thing is available, made to order in a jezve, a special long-handled coffeepot, the old-fashioned way: boil the water, add the roasted and powdered coffee and sugar, stir and heat to a frothing simmer (about three minutes). Then pour from the spout into an itty-bitty espresso-style cup and sip it hot, while the grounds settle to the bottom and you linger. But I get ahead of myself.
2003-04-20	Personal Business; With Interest Rates Stable, Credit Card Fees Rise	THE chances are good that something about your credit cards has changed recently. If you carry a Citibank or Chase card, for example, your late fees are now based on your outstanding balance; the greater the debt, the higher the fee. Customers of First USA now pay a 2 percent surcharge on overseas purchases, on top of what the credit card networks charge. MBNA and American Express, among many others, are raising interest rates or reducing credit limits of customers who slip up with any other creditors, even if those customers' record with them is clean.
2003-04-13	Comfort and Joy	IT would be easy to walk right past Marco & Pepe without noticing, and perhaps that is part of the idea. Certainly it is part of the charm. The restaurant, with only a sign painted inconspicuously in a front window, inhabits a neighborhood in transition, though it is not easy to say from what to what. The squat two-story building, on a corner opposite Jersey City's extravagantly ornamented, timeworn City Hall, was a bodega; it is made of the fading dun-colored brick that evokes Depression-era Hudson County as vividly as any tale of Boss Frank Hague.
2003-04-09	Refunds Ordered For Card Users	Visa International Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. hid foreign exchange fees and must give customers refunds, a judge said yesterday in a ruling that could cost the companies as much as $500 million. Judge Ronald Sabraw of Superior Court in Alameda, Calif., ruled that Visa and MasterCard failed to alert cardholders about a 1 percent currency conversion fee. Judge Sabraw ordered the companies to submit a plan of restitution by April 28, said Allan Steyer, a lawyer for the consumer who filed the lawsuit.
2003-03-31	E-Commerce Report; Congress wants to put more restrictions on online gambling, and the sites look for ways around the rules.	CONGRESS took substantial action this month against Internet betting, with a House committee passing a bill to curb online gambling and a nearly identical bill being introduced in the Senate. Similar bills have been introduced in Congress before, but none passed both houses in the same session. With increased Congressional interest now, the legislation may well reach the president's desk this year. Gambling site operators -- many of them American expatriates in the Caribbean or Central America, where gambling laws are more relaxed -- have already begun to make adjustments to the changing environment by shifting their marketing efforts to other countries and devising ways to circumvent new laws.
2003-03-30	At Casual Cafe, a Bold and Eclectic Mix	IT has been ages since I have eaten at a place that lifted my spirits the way Oliva in New Preston did recently. The cafe occupies the lower level of a frame house in the center of town, but the food soars to great heights. While nothing is fancy here - it is a casual cafe after all, with no liquor license, but a B.Y.O.B. policy - the food and service are both impeccable.
2003-03-30	French, Oui, Mingled with Pan-Asian	LONGTIME residents in this area of Ossining will remember the Campwoods Sweet Shop, a genuinely old-fashioned soda fountain and coffee shop that occupied this corner storefront for many years. While times have changed, the spirit of the old shop lives on with the newest occupant, Papillon. The co-owners Robert and Anne Hile, chef and baker respectively, have restored the 1940's soda fountain occupying one wall of the long, narrow restaurant. Odd tables, benches and chairs are tucked into the remaining space, and odds and ends add to the place's casual charm. Ornate glass chandeliers and draped ropes of silver beads festoon the windows; huge illuminated paper stars, mirrors and polished copper molds glitter here and there. Tiny hurricane lamps and a few flowers decorate the tables.
2003-03-30	The Accidental Osteria	IT may have a name that only a regular could love, an awkward mouthful taken from three languages. But the good news for Jerry's Gourmet Osteria, a two-year-old restaurant in Mercedes country, is that there are plenty of regulars. Jerry and Isabella Turci -- he's Italian, born outside Naples, and her family came to Bergen County by way of Hoboken -- found themselves in the restaurant business through a series of happy accidents. Years ago, he ran a discount-perfume outlet and she was a makeup artist. Through some peculiar inspiration he got the idea of selling bread from the perfume counter, and then selling things to put between slices of the bread. Gradually the business morphed into Jerry's Gourmet, a bustling market in Englewood that is said to turn into an agreeable madhouse with the approach of every food-centered holiday.
2003-03-27	Market Place; Some Question Timing of Sears Credit Card Unit Sale	Sears, Roebuck could be selling its giant credit card business at the bottom of the market. The overall industry has weakened as overextended consumers have fallen behind on their payments, but the losses may be peaking, according to consultants and analysts who follow the business. Selling at the trough would seem to be a management misstep, since Sears might fetch a higher price for its unit if it waited for the business to recover.
2003-03-27	Sears Reinvents Itself, but What Exactly Is It?	At a time when economic hard times have eroded sales for retailers large and small, Sears, Roebuck is reinventing itself as a retail company -- without the cushion of its credit card business. Sears announced yesterday that it would put its credit card business, begun during the Depression, up for sale. The company says that its plan is well timed to reduce its $28.5 billion debt and to increase value for shareholders at Sears, which posted a 28 percent increase in retail income last year. Others say the approach is risky because it pits Sears, still in search of a strong public image, directly against retail behemoths like Wal-Mart, Target and Home Depot, not to mention fast-growing chains like Kohl's and the industry veteran J. C. Penney.
2003-03-26	Sears Is Said To Be Putting Credit Cards Up for Sale	Sears, Roebuck & Company is planning to announce today that it is putting its huge credit card operation up for sale, executives close to the company said. The move is an abrupt and radical shift in strategy for Sears, the nation's original retail mass marketer, as it abandons a business that has provided periodic strong growth over the last decade but has stumbled at times, including badly last year.
2003-03-23	Credit Card Woes	To the Editor: Susan Stellin's column soft-pedaled the way credit card companies cancel charging privileges when cardholders are away from home. My wife and I moved from Florida to San Francisco in January. Midway through Texas, gas stations and hotels began rejecting our Visa, then the MasterCard (issued by different banks). Luckily we had cash to carry us until we called one of the banks and chewed them out. The same problem cropped up in August 2001 in Paris.
2003-03-18	Big Credit Default Rate Forces Spiegel Bankruptcy Filing	In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the first Spiegel furniture warehouse, but by 1885, business was racing along again, and the founder, Joseph Spiegel, started offering credit to his customers under the slogan: ''We Trust the People.'' Yesterday, the Spiegel Group -- which owns the famous Spiegel catalog, Eddie Bauer and Newport News, another direct-mail clothing business -- filed for bankruptcy. The reason given was that the company had trusted too many people, and some did not pay their credit card bills.

The Justice Department asked a Federal District Court judge in Las Vegas to prohibit interference with the tax laws by Irwin Schiff, author of ''The Federal Mafia'' and other books that argue that income taxes are voluntary.

Without the magnetic card reader, how would America's credit-happy society function? Card readers are found just about anywhere that money changes hands: at stores, restaurants, A.T.M.'s, even gas pumps. But they are also used in many other places where the currency is information, not cash. People attending trade shows, for example, are often given magnetic ID cards that with a simple swipe at a booth can pass along a name, address and phone number. It is the electronic equivalent of dropping off a business card.

2003-03-04	Disney, Bank One and Visa International all agree to live together on one little card.	REMEMBER the commercials decades ago from Contadina that asked, ''Who put eight great tomatoes in that little bitty can?'' Now, the Bank One Corporation, the Walt Disney Company and Visa International plan to spend an estimated $125 million to $150 million to determine whether consumers will accept three big-brand logos on one little bitty credit card. The card, called the Disney Visa Credit Card from Bank One, enables holders to rack up points redeemable for Disney Dream Reward Dollars. But the three companies, which will formally announce their partnership today, are entering a crowded field of co-branded credit cards that already includes a directly competitive card from J. P. Morgan Chase, MasterCard International and the Vivendi Universal Entertainment division of Vivendi Universal.
2003-03-02	Personal Business; A Hidden Expense Lurks in Some Card Statements	GLOBETROTTING business travelers expect their companies to repay all their expenses, but many reimbursements are falling short because employees are not accounting for the currency-conversion fees that most credit cards add to overseas transactions. The problem lies in part with the way expenses are typically handled. Most people put them on their credit cards, then quickly submit their receipts, hoping that their employers' repayments arrive before the bills.
2003-02-24	To Cash This Paycheck, Find the Nearest A.T.M.	More than half of American workers have given up paychecks for the convenience of direct deposits. But for an estimated 25 million employees without bank accounts, payday usually still means visits to payroll then hefty fees at check-cashing windows. To reach those workers, some companies on payday transfer wages to plastic cards that work like debit cards. Employees, who typically pay a monthly fee if they make more than one withdrawal, use them to obtain money from automated teller machines and, in many cases, shop wherever Visa or MasterCard is accepted.

In September, Bloomingdale's began giving shoppers who charge five pairs of shoes on store cards an additional 25 percent, or $25, off a sixth pair. Pier 1 Imports cardholders who spend at least $1,000 a year receive free local deliveries. Neiman Marcus members who collect 100,000 points can upgrade their Hertz car rentals. Target card customers can donate 1 percent of what they spend to whichever nonprofit school -- public or private -- they select.
2003-02-16	The Secret? The Waiter	SING KAN YEUNG is a middle-aged man of middle height, with a brush cut and a blue chambray shirt and a face creased with smile lines. A native of Fujian province, on China's southeastern coast, he emigrated to Hong Kong and then, 27 years ago, came to New York and finally North Jersey. He has owned Marco-Polo's Secret for 12 years, and from time to time he still finds it necessary to race into the kitchen and take a hand with a wok. But if you come here, you urgently want him to be your waiter. It's possible to visit this restaurant and have an ordinary experience. The service can be perfunctory, even borderline rude (as some friends reported, to my chagrin, after a recent visit on a Saturday night). Dishes on the regular menu can be utterly standard, if competently made: crispy sesame this, General Tso's that. But if you can snag Mr. Yeung -- and it's a small place, so your odds are good -- you're in for a treat, and an education.
2003-02-12	$25 AND UNDER; A Latin Outpost in Inwood Where Tables Often Wait	THERE was a time not so long ago when I assumed Manhattan had reached Starbucks saturation. What did I know? Two or three thousand more have surely opened since then. And so it is with restaurants. Just when it seemed that ambitious restaurateurs had colonized every last corner, they began to move uptown -- way uptown. In the last year or so, restaurants have opened north of Harlem, including Hispaniola on West 181st Street, New Leaf Cafe in Fort Tryon Park and, with its oddly spelled name, Republ-K on Dyckman Street in Inwood. They stand out uptown, where the level of comfort rarely goes beyond fluorescent lights and plastic tablecloths.

2003-02-09	When the Next-Door Neighbor Is a Chef	PERFECT PARTIES CAFÉ is a bad name for a good restaurant, one that grew, as you might guess, out of a small catering business that became a takeout shop that began cooking dinners. Gradually, customers of the Madison establishment asked the owner to begin serving dinner on the premises and, since there was sufficient space for this in the rustic Post Road house, she assented. The café is open only four nights a week, Wednesday through Saturday, but it is busy enough so that there are times you need reservations, and it seems to be thriving.
2003-02-02	In the Neighborhood	THE LAST THING a restaurant critic wants is special treatment, and I thought I'd made a colossal mistake when I showed up at Taormina in the company of a regular. It was a busy Saturday night, and my companion, Joe, seemed to be the sun around which the entire restaurant revolved. He knew the specials before the waiter recited them. He had had all the best dishes. Plates of goodies showed up at our table unbidden. At one point, a tall man in chef's whites paid a call. Joe: ''So how's the risotto tonight? Any good?''
2003-02-02	The Man Who Turned Manhattanville Around	BEFORE Richard A. Berman's arrival at Manhattanville College here in 1995, the college, with less than $1 million in endowment, was losing more than $3 million a year. Its dorms, designed to hold 1,500 students, were more than half empty. It rarely turned down any applicant. With the college strapped for cash and defaulting on bonds, its buildings were falling apart. Everybody agrees he has turned the college around, and though Mr. Berman did not wave a magic wand, it almost seems as if he did, longtime faculty and staff members say. Now the liberal arts college has an enrollment of 1,470, more than twice the 660 it had in 1995. Its acceptance rate is 55 percent. It has balanced its books, stopped selling its land and is paying back its debts on schedule. And more important to both its faculty and students alike, it has earned a spot among the top tier of northern American colleges ranked by U.S. News & World Report and found its way into at least three college guide books popular among high school students. Tuition at Manhattanville is $20,600 per year; it has increased less than 5 percent each year.
2003-01-29	Sears Is Sued By Executive It Dismissed At Credit Unit	Sears, Roebuck & Company, which dismissed the president of its credit division in October shortly before announcing unexpected losses at the unit, is being sued by the executive, Kevin T. Keleghan, for defamation and breach of contract. The lawsuit, filed in an Illinois state court in November and reported yesterday in The Chicago Tribune, says that Mr. Keleghan has not received the severance pay he was entitled to after signing a contract in September. It also accuses the chief executive of Sears, Alan J. Lacy, of defaming Mr. Keleghan when Mr. Lacy said he withheld information and otherwise ''wasn't forthcoming'' about problems at the credit division. Sears set aside an additional $222 million to cover unpaid debt from its credit card operations in the third quarter.

2003-01-13	E-Commerce Report; African-Americans did far less online shopping this season than whites. Low credit-card ownership may be one reason.	MEMBERS of ethnic minorities are gaining on whites when it comes to Internet access. But when it comes to online shopping, at least, substantial gaps remain, especially for African-Americans. Even though African-Americans represent slightly more than 10 percent of the online population, they accounted for just 4 percent of online shoppers this holiday season, according to a report last week by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a research organization in Washington.

Clothes don't fit, wireless gadgets break, and that DVD player bought at full price now sells for 50 percent off. But if the usual warranties, returns and price adjustments don't seem to work, shoppers who used credit, debit or charge cards may be able to take advantage of some perks.

2002-12-15	Keeping the Faith	SCALINI FEDELI was just a few months old when my predecessor Fran Schumer visited it in March 1996, but she quickly zeroed in on its level of ambition. The young owner, Michael Cetrulo, ''hopes to own the best Italian restaurant in New Jersey someday,'' she wrote, adding, ''If my first meal at his new venture is any indication, he already does.'' Time passes. Scalini Fedeli is seven this month. Mr. Cetrulo, now a geriatric 35, has served many thousands of meals in this stylish remade 1740 farmhouse. And his restaurant has indeed soared to the top of the charts, ranking first among Italian restaurants in the current Zagat Survey. Mr. Cetrulo, who also owns the well-regarded Mondo Vecchio in Madison, has even gone on to play Manhattan, opening a second Scalini Fedeli in TriBeCa in 1999.
2002-12-01	Backroads Bonanza	AT THE RISK of sounding like a paid advertisement for the Chamber of Commerce, I urge you to take a drive to this corner of the state -- unless you already live here, in which case the following will not come as news. Warren County, especially the western reaches that look across the Delaware River to Pennsylvania, is New Jersey before the era of the corporate campus, before the McMansion, before Target. Out here, U. S. 46 is actually a pleasure to drive: it hugs the plunging, silvery Pequest River on its way through tiny forgotten hamlets like Bridgeville and Buttzville, Sarepta and Manunka Chunk. Jenny Jump and Worthington State Forests are thick with woods and hiking trails.
2002-11-24	A Small Menu With Some Hearty Choices	MY first glance around the two small dining rooms at Dina!, a restaurant in Wilton, was not love at first sight.

By all means request the first room, by far the perkier one, with a cheerful painting of stylized red poppies.
2002-11-24	JetBlue Starts Flights To Las Vegas Early	The low-fare airline JetBlue began service between New York and Las Vegas on Nov. 15, nearly two months ahead of schedule. The change was in response to the abrupt grounding of National Airlines, a Las Vegas-based discount carrier that had been operating under bankruptcy protection and was unable to secure additional financing. National, which stopped flying on Nov. 6, advised customers who bought tickets using Visa or MasterCard to apply for refunds through their credit card companies. Customers using other credit cards must ask those companies about refunds.

2002-11-17	Now That's Italian	ON the Wednesday of my second visit to Adagio, the Dow Jones industrial average had slithered down 88 more points. But within moments of being seated, I felt like the character in the Gershwin musical who sings: ''My bonds and shares may fall downstairs. Who cares, who cares? . . . I can't be bothered now!'' This high-end Italian restaurant, in a century-old former bank on what might be called the miracle mile in Summit's gold-plated downtown, breathes opulence and comfort. Though it opened only last January, it feels like a fixture, with its marble floors and bronze doors and Gilded Age hanging lamps of brass and alabaster. The owners, Joe and Cathy Cetrulo -- he's the chef, she's the pastry chef -- have also run the well-regarded La Campagna in Morristown for nearly eight years, and they have a pitch-perfect sense of their intended audience. Small wonder that the place bustles and hums even on a weeknight and that on Fridays and Saturdays it may be hard to get a table.
2002-11-14	Retailers' Suit Says 2 Issuers Of Debit Cards Broke Law	Retailers released documents yesterday that they say show that Visa International and MasterCard International colluded to monopolize the market for debit cards. The documents were filed in a class-action lawsuit -- representing five million retailers led by Wal-Mart Stores; Sears, Roebuck and Safeway -- that accuses Visa and MasterCard of trying to confuse merchants by designing their debit cards to be almost indistinguishable from their credit cards.
2002-11-13	For Stuffing More Than Just a Stocking	AFTER more than 20 years of testing hundreds of foods and products for my annual mail-order gift guide, I wonder if it's time for a change in nomenclature. A majority of the exciting holiday gifts I found this year are available online, and very few are shipped at the post office. Even better, online shopping seems finally to have achieved parity with the glossy catalogs, gastropornography and all. This year was perhaps the easiest shopping I've ever performed in the service of the holidays. Sublime, buttery smoked salmon from Michigan is included in this year's gift basket, along with juicy aged porterhouse steaks from the Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn and luscious organic peaches from the geniuses at Frog Hollow Farm in the Napa Valley. There are Nantucket Bay scallops as sweet as candy as well, a light and fragrant English fruitcake that puts the lie to that confection's terrible reputation and, of course, much more. For the first time, in fact, I've included a few kitchen implements to lift the hearts of your favorite cooks, including a programmable thermal coffeepot that, wonder of wonders, actually works.
2002-11-10	Business; A Bet on Credit Cards Becomes Messy at Sears	WASHING machines, work clothes, power tools and patio furniture. Sears, Roebuck built a rock-solid, if unexciting, image over the years by emphasizing such practical products. Americans shopped at Sears for what they truly needed, and out of that, the company has forged a $41 billion business, not only from selling the merchandise but also from helping to make the purchases possible. About 60 million Americans hold Sears credit cards, and credit provides 60 percent of the company's profits -- far more than at any other retailer. To Wall Street, in fact, the credit business often overshadows what happens inside the stores.
2002-11-10	In Lost and Found Offices, It's Hit or Miss	FOR everyone who has ever left a laptop on a train or forgotten a warm winter scarf in a theater, there exists an oasis of hope. It's called the lost-and-found department, and its storage shelves and rubber bins harbor a multitude of mysteries to go along with the items that have been left behind. How do people amble into the frosty cold while their coats get left behind on theater seats? How did the person who left a pair of crutches in an arena walk out unaided? What was the owner of the mislaid birthday cake preoccupied with besides celebrating another year?
2002-11-06	$25 AND UNDER; Ah, the Sweet Memories of Nostalgia in the Making	THERE was Dad, dressed as a pirate for Halloween and looking the part for real. He was sneaking a smoke out on Union Street while an equally buccaneerish mom and her cross-boned kids crayoned on the brown-paper table coverings inside DuMont, and someone's little sister served them striped bass. There were fat burgers for the children, and also for the sawdusty artists at the bar talking about loft build-outs, women and gallery shows past. DuMont, which opened a little more than a year ago just east of the grimy shadows cast by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, is a warm and pleasant refuge for young daters, old neighborhood hands, even the occasional visitor from afar. It serves a simple menu of six items, accompanied by daily chalkboard specials.
2002-10-30	$25 AND UNDER; A Surprise From Bologna Warms a Village Table	HERE'S a tip from the boys at the WXOU bar on Hudson Street, whispered over pints. Just walk into Da Andrea, that little joint across the street, and order a plate of tigelle ($8.50). Do it even before you've looked at the menu, before you've asked for a short glass of wine, before anything. Biscuits are involved. It takes a while to make. A young couple from Bologna, Tiziana Vecchietti and Pietro Branchi, have been Da Andrea's owners since the beginning of 2001. Ms. Vecchietti said they were able to get the space when the original Andrea, who was from Capri, decided to return to Italy. Mr. Branchi runs the kitchen along with Andrea Vecchietti, Ms. Vecchietti's brother, so there was no need to change the restaurant's name.
2002-10-27	California Dreamin'	YOU will never confuse Joel's Malibu Kitchen with anybody else's kitchen. Calling Joel Scheinzeit the moving force behind this sweet, eccentric, slightly ramshackle and wholly engaging restaurant is like calling Sylvester Stallone the main character in ''Rocky.'' It's true, but it doesn't even scratch the surface. Mr. Scheinzeit (pronounced SHINE-zite, but this may be the only time all year anybody calls him anything but Joel) is 39 years old, a tall man with a mostly shaved head and a ponytail who wears an Iron Maiden T-shirt under his chef's apron. He grew up in nearby Fair Lawn, attended the Culinary Institute of America and headed for Southern California with dreams of becoming a rock star.
2002-10-18	Sears Earnings Will Be Hurt By Credit Unit	Sears, Roebuck, midway through a crucial effort to attract more shoppers to its stores, said yesterday that its credit division had suffered unexpected losses from delinquent cardholders that would depress earnings for the rest of the year. Sears said its earnings for the third quarter would be higher than last year but still 26 percent below the company's prediction made earlier this month. For the full year, earnings will total $4.86 a share, down from $5.15 forecast at the same time.
2002-10-16	$25 AND UNDER; Italy Plus Asia Plus Latin America Plus Chocolate Fondue	''SO tell me why you're getting bored with Brian,'' a woman said to her friend, the two of them clad in matching cardigans and eating matching endive salads ($7) with grilled Roquefort and brioche sandwich fingers buried within them. This was at Wyanoka, on Mott Street, a 19th-century Irish workingman's club that became an Italian social club in the 1920's and a restaurant in 2000, all of them with the same American Indian name. It was unclear if she meant a beau or a boss. Her friend declined to discuss it. She wanted to talk about Dave Eggers's new book, which she was trying to track down for ''Liz, who loves him and is, did I tell you, temping!'' She went on to rave about the spiced almonds in the salad; they were a perfect match, she said, for the grilled grapefruit that decorated the plate.

2002-09-29	A Portuguese Grill Where You Can Linger	CHURRASQUEIRA RIBATEJO is the kind of place you might peek into and, depending on your nerve, decide to stay or go. I say stay, especially if you've grown weary of high-style food. At this Portuguese grill, the portions are large and the presentation is straightforward. You see, hear and smell everything: the sizzling grill where handmade shrimp and cod cakes turn on a spit; nearby patrons airily smoking cigarettes or cigars and, in the grotto-like back dining room, television news delivered in a foreign tongue. If you can get past the unrefined atmosphere, the food, often served at your table from the steel pots in which it was cooked, will reward you.
2002-09-29	From Pho to Che Bam Au	IF a city is a living thing, Jersey City is more alive than most, its sprawling and disparate collection of neighborhoods in a state of change so rapid you can see and feel and taste it -- a time-lapse photograph in three dimensions and all five senses. Take the section called Downtown, once Italian- and Polish-American, now largely Hispanic and Asian. Like many longtime residents, Irene Stapinski, who grew up in Jersey City in the 1930's and 40's and still lives near Journal Square, remembers eating at Ducky's, an Italian restaurant whose most compelling feature was not the food but the mystery surrounding the proprietor. ''Ducky disappeared,'' she said. ''They never found him. It was all anyone talked about.''
2002-09-28	MGM Mirage Seeks to Lure The Gamblers Of Cyberspace	MGM Mirage plans to start an Internet casino next month, becoming the first United States casino to confront the challenges involved in offering blackjack, roulette and craps to gamblers on home computers. The casino, whose computer operations will be based on the Isle of Man, a tiny island in the Irish Sea, will initially have a policy of refusing bets from residents of the United States, where it is illegal to offer gambling online.
2002-09-25	Tips Past the Tipping Point	IT'S a pop quiz that's given thousands and thousands of times a day. A waiter clears your table and then presents the bill. In this case, let's say, it amounts to $63.21, $58.40 of which is for food and drinks, and $4.81 for the sales tax. You hand over your credit card and await the flimsy sales chit, which you will sign after you add a tip and calculate the total. But how much tip? Many savvy New Yorkers simply double the 8.25 percent tax to get a figure that's slightly more than 15 percent of the pretax total on the bill, which is generally accepted as a fair tip. That's assuming that at the end of the meal you felt like neither royalty nor riffraff. That's $9.62 on our pretax tab of $58.40.
2002-09-15	Cafe Life	FOR all the numbing ordinariness of its setting a slightly forlorn strip mall on a no-name stretch of highway on the outskirts of a Monmouth County borough that would dearly love to reinvigorate its downtown -- Caspita is one of the most fetching restaurants around. Its owners, Kathy and Michael DiBiase, call it a cafe, and for once that all-purpose noun has real meaning. It was just that, a cafe, when it started life six years ago. It served, and still serves, a line of desserts and first-rate coffees. The owners have managed to disguise the generic quality of the storefront space by installing a tin ceiling and an exposed-brick wall (hung, for the moment, with evocative black-and-white scenes of Paris and Italy by the local photographer Joyce Chadwick).
2002-09-13	Hunting Tax Cheats, I.R.S. Vows To Focus More Effort on the Rich	The Internal Revenue Service said yesterday that it intended to go after tax cheats in a new way, easing its examination of ordinary wage earners and devoting more of its attention to wealthy taxpayers suspected of hiding income received from their businesses, partnerships, investments and offshore accounts. The agency said it had already begun to focus on promoters of abusive tax schemes, from those selling sophisticated strategies involving currency trades to those saying that people should refuse to pay taxes by claiming that they are voluntary. The I.R.S. said it had developed a secret statistical technique to identify taxpayers who fail to report their full income.
2002-09-08	A Dream in Green	FROM its restful green walls to its earnest, inquiring chef, Andiamo is a restaurant that I want to love. Tucked between quaint antique shops and near its more famous neighbor, a restaurant called No. 9, its crisp white tablecloths and Sinatra music seem a respite from one too many meals of roasted chicken, baby vegetables and garlicky mashed potatoes. There are gems to be found at this 47-seat restaurant. The grilled chicken corn chowder served one Friday at lunch was a delight of textures and complementary flavors. A seafood salad appetizer was a lush compilation of mussels and bay scallops, dressed lightly and brightly in a vinaigrette flavored with the juice of lemons, limes and orange. The ravioli, a couple of super-size puffs filled with chicken and smoked Gouda and dressed with browned butter, was a winsome combination. The lentil soup, a lunch special, was earthy and satisfying without relying on a meat-based stock. And I continued eating a salmon salad sandwich, dotted with capers and red onion, then sparked with dill and Old Bay seasoning mix, long past satiety, because the flavors worked so well together. Those dishes, and the desserts, made Andiamo a terrific, reasonably priced spot for lunch.
2002-09-08	Closer to Shinnecock Than to Bangkok	''Q STANDS for quasi, as in quasi-Thai.'' Even though we knew it didn't at Q, a Thai Bistro in Southampton, the observation was apt. (It is actually named for a character in the James Bond books and films, as is the parent restaurant in Queens.) At the time the speaker made his comment, he was toying with a piece of chocolate truffle cake while lamenting the lack of his favorite Thai rice dessert. Q is not a typical Thai restaurant, but many diners will embrace its Western desserts and be thrilled to encounter a full-fledged wine list rather than the jugged reds and whites found at many Asian spots.
2002-09-08	Reminiscent of Japan in Taste and Setting	KIKU SUSHI in the Springdale section of Stamford is so tiny that it is like wandering into a snug sushi bar in the labyrinthine side streets of Tokyo's Ginza district. The comparison does not end there. The specialties are various sushi and sashimi combinations.
2002-09-05	Technology Briefing | Deals: VeriSign And MasterCard Sign Pact	VeriSign Inc., a provider of payment systems for online businesses, has signed a deal with MasterCard International that could help reduce the risk of fraud by making it harder for people to use stolen credit cards for purchases online. VeriSign, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., said its nearly 75,000 merchant customers will be able to verify the identity of customers using MasterCard credit cards by using a personal identification number. As users of the new system, those merchants will benefit from a new MasterCard rule that shifts responsibility for unauthorized online purchases from the merchant to financial institutions. VeriSign, which is also the largest registrar of Internet domain names, processes nearly one-fourth of all online purchases. The specific terms of the deal were not disclosed. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)
2002-08-31	Consumers Praised, or Blamed, for Aiding Recovery	Though the economy took a pummeling in the second quarter, consumers struck a modest blow for the recovery at the beginning of the third. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that personal spending in July jumped 1 percent, to $7.35 trillion -- the biggest increase in nine months -- thanks largely to low interest rates. Consumers managed to spend more even though their total incomes did not change. Mortgage refinancing and lower income-tax rates helped to put more of consumers' existing income at their disposal. In addition, saving as a share of disposable income dropped to 3.4 percent from 4.2 percent in June.
2002-08-30	I.R.S. Sues for Disclosure of Offshore Accounts	The Internal Revenue Service went to court today in an effort to force more than 40 companies, including AOL Time Warner, eBay and American Airlines, to surrender information on customers the agency suspects are hiding income in offshore accounts. Summonses filed in federal courts in seven cities were the first attempt by the I.R.S. to review documents from companies whose goods or services were purchased with credit cards linked to offshore accounts.
2002-08-28	Australia Lowers Fees Involving Credit Cards	Australia's central bank ordered sweeping changes in the way credit card businesses operate today. The bank said the changes would lower costs and promote competition. The proposal was made over the strong objections of the two main credit card brands, Visa International and MasterCard International.
2002-08-28	$25 AND UNDER; Smoke and Spice: Peruvian Classics in the East Village	THERE was smoke in the air last week, thick, and that was all right. It was at Lima's Taste, which opened about four months ago on a quiet block in the East Village, serving slightly upscale versions of Peruvian classics: ceviche, papas rellenas, barbecued chicken, grilled steak. The vent fans in the kitchen, above the stove, couldn't keep up with the cooks. But what oxygen there was came to the nose redolent of lemons and onions and cilantro and beef. There was occasionally the tang of chili in the air, and the bright odor of ceviche rose from the table. Eyes were burning. Mouths, however, were wet.
2002-08-21	$25 AND UNDER; Chinese Trappings in an All-American Hideaway	THEY were singing ''Happy Birthday'' at M Shanghai Bistro & Den the other evening to a woman whose age, for the purposes of anecdote, is of no concern. The bartender clanged a gong as the restaurant's customers, seated along communal tables in the small dining room, clapped. A cake was presented: airy, with a chocolate filling and white icing. The woman cut it and handed out slices. Now there were cheers. ''This cake is so Italian,'' she said, giggling. ''And I'm so Puerto Rican! It's perfect!''
2002-08-18	A French Bistro Specializing in Seafood	A FRENCH bistro specializing in seafood is a perfect fit for the Hamptons. That casual bistro atmosphere and emphasis on the local bounty are just what summer vacationers on the East End are looking for. Pierre's in Bridgehampton is just such a place. It resides at 2468 Main Street, an address that was home to a string of other restaurants, the last being the Lure at the Independent. Pierre's has a crisp bistro look: white walls and wainscotting, pressed-tin ceiling, matchstick blinds, sea green banquettes, seaside-inspired prints and black-and-white photographs and, of course, white butcher paper placed bistro-style over tablecloths.
2002-08-18	Deck the Malls	RETURN with us now to the thrilling days of yesteryear. For three decades, this sprawl of a building just west of the Garden State Plaza was Chan's Waikiki, a faux-Hawaiian palace that served neon cocktails with paper umbrellas and was retro even before it opened. Then, for a time in the late 90's, it was R. J. Gator's, the northern outpost of a Florida chain (its namesake dish was ''alligator nibbles'') that made only the faintest impression on Bergen County's dining consciousness before vanishing without a trace. Bisque is something else altogether. Opened a year and a half ago, it aims to bring an Upper East Side sensibility to the beating heart of mall country. From the muted lighting to the white tablecloths and dark-wood paneling, from the menu's up-market ingredients and prices to the hauteur with which it sets them forth (''Seared Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass . . . Twenty-six fifty''), this place is as different from its predecessors as foie gras is from alligator nibbles.
2002-08-11	Tasty Food, Fine Décor, and It's a Bargain	WHEN awards for beautification are distributed, the Arch deserves a trophy in a special category: one that recognizes both the lovely details of the décor in the discrete dining areas -- silken draperies, dainty buds on napkin rings, brilliant bouquets; some rooms crimson, some golden; tinted mirrors, mellow peachy lighting, flickering candles -- and the glamorous, flattering glow cast on all who dine here. Under the direction of George Seitz, chef and proprietor for the last 25 years, the kitchen hums with serious cooking: proper timing, fresh ingredients (note the extensive herb garden at the entrance) and, not least, the subtle balance of flavors and textures. Salty Black Forest ham pairs with slices of sweet ripe tomato; silky scallops are scattered with crunchy pine nuts. Expect the delicious unexpected.
2002-08-07	$25 AND UNDER; A Taste of Vietnam With a Little Flavor of Chinatown	WHEN you go to Pho Grand, a new Vietnamese restaurant on Grand Street, begin by ordering the avocado juice ($2.50). It is a phenomenal treat, a kind of avocado smoothie, thick and creamy but not heavy and only a bit sweet. You won't want it to start, but you may want it later. And if you order it the moment you arrive, it may be served before you leave. Timing is not Pho Grand's specialty. When we ordered four appetizers and three entrees at lunch, they arrived all at once. The servers covered our table with dishes, and, when they ran out of room, seemed baffled. Everyone appreciates speedy service at lunch, but this much food at once was simply gross.
2002-07-25	VISA REDUCES FEES IN RESPONSE TO INQUIRY IN EUROPE	The credit card company Visa International Inc. agreed to reduce and cap certain fees charged for cross-border transactions in Europe to end an antitrust investigation into the fees by the European Commission. The commission was investigating a charge that Visa's fees, which were charged to retailers, abused its dominant position in the credit card market. In return for restricting the fees, Visa received an exemption from European Union rules intended to prevent dominant players like Visa from charging such fees. The commission is also investigating fees charged by MasterCard International Inc. Paul Meller (NYT)
2002-07-24	$25 AND UNDER; In the Village, Savory Italian Fare Staggers to the Table	MOST restaurants contain two cultures, like two peoples living on shared land. There is the wait staff and the kitchen staff, known, respectively, to insiders as the front of the house and the back of the house. They rarely blend and mingle, but they do learn to tolerate one another and to present, usually, a united front. But in the case of Osteria del Sole, which opened up four months ago, in the space formerly occupied by EQ (and later the Q Bar) on West Fourth Street, it is as if the two are from different planets. Never before have I been to a restaurant where the food was so good and the service so abysmal.
2002-07-21	Creditworthy? Be Credit-Wary, Too	I LIKE to think of myself as a fairly intelligent, financially sophisticated person. I know that big businesses don't always have my best interests at heart, that the customer is rarely right. I pride myself on not being a sucker. So you can imagine my annoyance when I read my most recent MasterCard bill and noticed two annual percentage rates: 14.5 percent for purchases and 19.99 percent for a $300 cash advance I took out in February.
2002-07-18	REGULATORY MOVE CAUSES DROP IN CAPITAL ONE SHARES	The Capital One Financial Corporation, a leading issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, said regulators required it to increase reserves for loan losses, setting off a sharp decline in its stock and that of its rivals. Capital One shares fell $20.12, or 39.8 percent, to $30.48. There were also losses in the stocks of the Providian Financial Corporation and Household International Inc., rivals that, like Capital One, have lent to clients with a history of bad credit. Although Capital One has had fewer unpaid bills than rivals, regulators said they were concerned that the company had grown too fast. Capital One said yesterday that it added $247 million in reserves in the second quarter to meet federal requirements.
2002-07-14	In Hastings, Views of Garden and River	ON a balmy summer night, one could not do better than stroll through Harvest-on-Hudson's riverside gardens, neat plots of herbs -- sage, mint, rosemary -- plucked for the kitchen now, and corn, squash, peppers and eggplant showing promise for harvest in August. The restaurant's wrap of glass -- doors and windows -- takes every advantage of the setting. The food, however, is less dependable than the surroundings. No surprise: The handsome, if noisy, dining hall and the adjoining terrace can seat more than 300 diners, and often do.
2002-07-10	$25 AND UNDER; Where the Rio Grande Flows to the Brooklyn Waterfront	FROM Alma, Lower Manhattan appears like a stage backdrop. It is there for your pleasure, to take in during lulls in the meal, nothing more, it seems, than a facade. This is because it is difficult to grasp how such a good restaurant could be in such an odd place, amid a strip that includes a shipyard, car lots and a live poultry market on the edge of Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn. Not very long ago, there was, in fact, nothing in this spot. Last year, Ronald Starns, the former maître d'hôtel at March restaurant, got together with three partners, two of them woodworkers. They bought the vacant lot and constructed the building. The woodworkers crafted matte table tops from maple. Mr. Starns tiled the bathroom. They painted the walls cantaloupe. They hired Gary Jacobson, who was the chef at Zarela's for 14 years, and Alma, a Mexican restaurant, was born. (The name Alma means ''soul'' in Spanish. There is no great reason they chose the name, they said. They liked it.)
2002-07-07	Business & Investing; Tollbooth Technology Meets the Checkout Lane	MILLIONS of motorists in the Northeast have discovered the convenience of E-ZPass, which lets them move quickly through toll stations as electronic readers automatically deduct their fees. The system has become so popular that the consortium of states that operates the technology has increased its projections for its use to 53 percent of vehicles, from 35 percent. Now, this technology is helping people zip through the rest of their lives with equal ease. Call it the new mobile commerce.
2002-07-07	Destination: Vietnam	SAIGON REPUBLIC opened just three months ago in a tiny, invitingly dark storefront at the leading edge of the wave of gentrification rolling down the East Hill of the Palisades through Englewood's central business district. Unlike the dozens of Vietnamese restaurants around the country that reflexively call themselves Saigon This or Saigon That, it comes by its name honestly. The chef and owner, Khanh Tran, -- K. T., or Katie, to her friends and staff -- emigrated to the United States with her family in 1967, as a girl of 13, from what was then the capital of South Vietnam. Her father was secretary to his country's ambassador to the United Nations, and as the war grew ever grimmer, decided to keep his family in New York.
2002-07-03	$25 AND UNDER; In Park Slope, Thai Rolls Easily Off the Tongue	I WAS the first of a party of three to arrive at Long Tan, and when I asked to be seated, the host, a man dressed all in black, pointed to the worst table. ''How about that booth?'' I asked, pointing in the opposite direction. ''I can't sit you there,'' he said, ''because I don't know that the rest of your party will show up. I mean, if it were a Friday or Saturday, I wouldn't seat you ahead of time at all.'' I looked around. It was a Wednesday and Long Tan, deep in Park Slope, was fairly sleepy. ''O.K. then,'' I said, stewing. ''I think I'll wait in the bar.''
2002-06-30	Mixing and Matching in a Yankee Bistro	IMAGINE my surprise. I had been extolling Cafe Routier's French menu and ambience in its former location in Old Saybrook to my three companions as we drove to the restaurant's new locale in Westbrook, but as we entered the parking lot, the first words to greet our eyes were: ''Cafe Routier, a Yankee bistro.'' In moving a few miles down I-95, French insouciance had morphed into casual New England with a New American menu.
2002-06-29	Hosts' Big Hopes Are Let Down By World Cup	As the World Cup, the world's most heavily watched sporting event, closes Sunday hopes that it would help reinvigorate the Japanese economy failed to come true. There were corporate and government winners and losers, of course. Among the winners were agile companies with enough goods on hand to ride a fad. As Japan's team inspired the nation, for instance, lines 100 yards long formed at a Tokyo sporting goods store stocked with the coveted authentic Japan team shirts, with fans desperate to surrender $125 for an Adidas team shirt.
2002-06-26	East of Midtown, It's the Art of the Meal	''WHAT is food to one man may be fierce poison to others,'' wrote the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. He might as well have said the same of contemporary art -- and of New York neighborhoods. This weekend, as the Museum of Modern Art opens in its new temporary location across the East River in Long Island City, Queens, visitors will have a chance to determine the validity of all three claims. The Modern in Queens -- which will open on Saturday and house the museum until renovations on its East 53rd Street building in Manhattan are finished in 2005 -- is a deftly renovated warehouse on 33rd Street off Queens Boulevard. That may be enough to shock some of the museum's old guard, perhaps more accustomed to limousines than to the No. 7 local. But it is a boon to hungry visitors. Within a short walk from the museum, there are about a dozen interesting, and remarkably toothsome, dining options: from Korean to Romanian to Japanese to Irish. For the most part, they are dirt cheap. If your idea of a good New York day is a great museum visit beginning or ending with a great lunch, the new Modern means you are in for a treat.
2002-06-23	Old Reliable	WHEN the definitive restaurant dictionary is written, La Focaccia may serve as the entry for ''Neighborhood spot, congenial.'' It inhabits the ground floor of one of those boxy early-20th-century factory workers' houses that look slightly incongruous in this high-toned town. On most nights it fills early with families and with couples on dates, carrying their own wine or beer in brown shopping bags. They are greeted by platoons of white-aproned waiters who start out brusque and formal but are soon treating everyone at the table like an old friend. There's a working wood-burning oven, a colorful display of antipasto near the entrance and a television that as far as I can tell goes entirely unwatched.
2002-06-16	For Starters	HERE'S a modest proposal: Take every other fast food joint along the New Jersey Turnpike and turn it into an adaptation of Aladin's Restaurant. Lose the boring burgers with American cheese and serve falafel wrapped in pita with tahini sauce instead. Drop the fries; replace those gut expanders with kibbeh balls, delicate spinach pies or stuffed grape leaves. And deep-six the hot dogs; substitute Elie Chedid's delectable kebabs, mild sausage wraps or, for the spice-lovers, the spicy version of sausage called sujok. Wouldn't it be lovely? Good food with assertive flavors, and just as fast as a burger and fries. It's a dream. In the meantime, there is a Mediterranean oasis named for the young man (whose name is usually spelled Aladdin) who found the magic lamp, and I'm delighted.
2002-06-15	Citibank Bans Credit Cards From Use in Web Gambling	Citibank said yesterday that it had agreed to block use of its credit cards for Internet gambling transactions. The decision came after regulators from New York State told Citibank that it could face criminal prosecution for aiding in the promotion of online gambling, which is illegal in the state. Citibank joins a handful of other major credit card issuers, including ProvidianBank, that have already said they will try to block use of their cards for Internet gambling. Citibank, with 33 million Visa and MasterCard holders, is the nation's largest credit card issuer.
2002-06-12	$25 AND UNDER; In the Garment District, a New Caribbean Beat	FEW dishes pack as heavyweight a punch as mofongo, the Caribbean preparation of mashed green plantains that is anything but tropical. Like a roundhouse right -- bam! -- comes enough garlic to silence even Emeril Lagasse. Like a double left uppercut -- boom! boom! -- lard and crisp pork cracklings are laced throughout, rich as a shot of butter with a bacon chaser. The only response after a dose of mofongo is a long nap. That's true at least with the usual mofongo, a staple of Dominican restaurants, Cuban cafes and Puerto Rican kitchens. But at Plantain Cafe, a casual new pan-Caribbean restaurant on the edge of the garment district, mofongo takes on a new identity: fresh and lively. Instead of a weighty mound of starch, these plantains are puréed with olive oil until they're moist and airy, almost like soft polenta, and saturated with fresh garlic as if this quintessential island dish had absorbed the spirit of the Mediterranean.
2002-06-11	Credit Card Issuers Face a Class Action	The Supreme Court refused today to block a class-action lawsuit that seeks at least $24 billion from Visa USA and MasterCard International for trying to extend their credit card dominance into debit cards. The justices, without comment, left intact an appeals court decision from New York letting more than four million merchants seek damages from the two associations.
2002-06-09	The Sushi Belt	THIS is East's third appearance in the Restaurants column. If that sounds like a lot, the fact is that this popular Japanese restaurant in a great white barn of a building on Teaneck Road has really been three restaurants since it opened in February 1987. While East is merely an outpost of a successful chain of Manhattan restaurants -- East West, you might call it -- it has always maintained a personality of its own. In 1987, it was a bustling place, with a whiff of the exotic: you checked your shoes at the door, sat at sunken tables and ordered the grilled, skewered street food called yakitori from a big central bar. Our reviewer Anne Semmes rated it very good.
2002-05-26	Dining Out; Home on the Range	WHEN Henry Hovorka opened Heather's Open Cucina 10 years ago, in a former Chinese restaurant that had finally died of hardened arteries, he was something of a pioneer. This river village, a few minutes north of Bergen County, was well into its glamorous second life as SoHo on the Hudson, a fashionably bohemian gathering point for antiques, the arts and the occasional resident movie star. Whether it could sustain a serious restaurant was still an open question. Mr. Hovorka, a Rockland County boy then still in his 20's, proved that it could. Heather's succeeded on its own terms, with robust and conscientiously prepared Northern Italian food. It drew crowds and gave rise to a field of competitors -- including its founder's own LuShane's, named for his sons Luke and Shane, which opened in November 1998 in a former haberdashery two doors down the street.
2002-05-22	$25 AND UNDER; On the Trail of the White Rabbit, on the Upper West Side	IN three visits to Alice's Tea Cup, a sweet little restaurant and shop on the Upper West Side that serves superb tea, I never saw another male customer, except for two young fellows I once took with me. This didn't totally surprise me. Just as steakhouses are largely masculine domains, tearooms like Alice's are perceived as feminine, full of lacy trappings and curlicues. That's the way Americans think, at least. At Tea and Sympathy in Greenwich Village, a hangout for British expats, men knock back their cuppas as naturally as American men drink beers at a ballgame. Except for the ''Alice in Wonderland'' and Lewis Carroll bric-a-brac, Alice's is hardly British, which is why, sitting at the mismatched flea-market tables, I saw mothers and daughters speaking heart to heart, women talking business, women talking children and women talking men. But no other men.
2002-05-16	Wal-Mart Is Seeking Approval to Buy a California Bank	Wal-Mart is seeking regulatory approval to buy a tiny California bank, saying it hopes a banking license will lower its processing costs for certain transactions. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest company, has aggressively expanded beyond basic consumer goods and appliances into the sale of drugs and groceries. By acquiring a bank, Wal-Mart could offer a range of financial services: savings accounts and certificates of deposit as well as home equity loans or auto financing.
2002-05-15	$25 AND UNDER; Completing an Offbeat Trifecta on Clinton Street	ALIAS, which opened several months ago on the Lower East Side, serves seared pork loin with sauerkraut. Its duck confit comes with black-eyed peas, its ceviche with roasted pumpkin seed oil. It cures its own sable and offers its own pickle plate. All the offbeat pairings and neighborhood homages that have made its older Clinton Street siblings, 71 Clinton Fresh Food and aKa Café, so popular are intact at Alias, the third member of this mini-empire. With these three restaurants all within half a block, it's a wonder that they don't step on one another's toes.
2002-05-13	CREDIT CARD THEFT IS THRIVING ONLINE AS GLOBAL MARKET	Tens of thousands of stolen credit-card numbers are being offered for sale each week on the Internet in a handful of thriving, membership-only cyberbazaars, operated largely by residents of the former Soviet Union, who have become central players in credit-card and identity theft. The marketplaces -- where credit card prices fluctuate with supply and demand in a sort of black stock market -- offer a window into a crime that costs the financial system $1 billion or more a year. They also show how readily personal information is being stolen and traded in the computer age.
2002-05-12	A Bistro Bristling With Sophistication	IN recent years there has been a bistro boomlet on Long Island, and the epicenter for Suffolk County falls somewhere between St. James and East Setauket. First there was Kitchen A Bistro in St. James, followed by Village Bistro in East Setauket. Metropolis, an established restaurant in East Setauket, recently changed its name to Cool Blue Bistro, and Voilà! The Bistro opened in St. James where Dublin Delights once was. Voilà may label itself a bistro, but the food is more ambitious and refined than that. There is no burger on its menu, nor steak frites nor roasted chicken, all American bistro standards. Instead, look for dishes like venison Wellington and sashimi of cured salmon.
2002-05-12	A Few Bumps on the Way to a Pampered Pig	''I DOUBT if this wild pig ever set a trotter outside a comfy pen, let alone in a forest.'' This comment by a friend during our dinner at the Boxing Horse Bistro in Lakeville was prompted by a bite of the best pork I have ever eaten, bar none. Billed as ''fire-grilled tenderloin of wild pig,'' the pork was cooked just to the pink stage and was tender, with a texture so fine grained it was almost buttery. Indisputably, the pork was the high point of quite a good meal, unmarred by anything but morose service. (This was the first time in years of reviewing that I have witnessed a server pour a red wine into a glass that still held a drop or two of chardonnay, the most conversation-stopping of a number of take-it-or-leave-it actions.)
2002-05-08	$25 AND UNDER; Sometimes What a Neighborhood Needs Is a Steak	FROM the night it opened in late March, Carne, a small steakhouse-style restaurant a few blocks south of Morningside Heights, has drawn a steady stream of diners from the neighborhood. Professors from Columbia, families with infants, dating couples, elderly men, solitary people with newspapers -- they've all come to what is really little more than a bar and grill. The appeal of Carne is clear. In an area with plenty of inexpensive restaurants, one option was lacking: a grown-up place for a well-made cocktail, a thick steak and a good bottle of wine. Carne delivers the steaks, the cocktails and the wine, but in its first weeks it suffered from disorganization beyond what is typical of new restaurants. The waiters didn't know the menu, food arrived at the wrong table, bottles of wine never showed up, crackers were served instead of bread. What I ate was good, but the long waits and the confusion were hard to endure.
2002-05-01	$25 AND UNDER; Same Stage, but Every Night's a New Show	VALUE shows up in the strangest places. At the famously expensive Alain Ducasse, where a three-course prix fixe dinner runs $160 and a cup of herbal tea is $12, an $18 cheese plate is a fabulous value. Each selection is perfectly ripe, and a serving is easily enough for two. At Patio Dining in the East Village, which exists in a different universe from Ducasse, there is a $9 cheese plate, consisting of a paltry two thin slices that the waitress could not identify, along with a few wan pieces of apple and the barest hint of fig compote. This is a pitiful value.
2002-04-24	More Regulations to Thwart Money Laundering Are Imposed	Moving to carry out a crucial part of the antiterrorism legislation signed into law last fall by President Bush, the Treasury Department imposed new regulations today on a wide variety of financial institutions and other businesses in an effort to cut off the flow of money to terrorist groups. The regulations extend to many industries that handle large sums of money from customers the same types of anti-money-laundering requirements long imposed on banks.
2002-04-14	Sometimes Things Do Improve With Age	REVISITING a restaurant reviewed years ago can sometimes provide pleasant surprises, as I discovered at two very different places recently. One was a lunch stop at Bangkok Garden in New Haven, en route to the Yale Repertory Theater, which is handily situated across the street. My companion and I were so pleased we made a return trip for dinner a week later.
2002-04-14	Olé! Mole!	TENDER, succulent shrimp, exuding garlic and cilantro. Chiles rellenos, puffy deep-fried mounds of lightly battered poblano chiles, sparingly filled with Oaxaca cheese, fragrant tendrils of steam tickling your nose, a drizzling of light tomato sauce, a sprinkling of queso fresco. It's the Mexican food I hope for every time I see a logo with cactus, sombreros, the green, white and red colors of the Mexican flag. But in central New Jersey, it's not easy to find. In the Princeton area, there are at least two of the ''other'' Mexican restaurants, the ones that offer platters of indistinguishable ingredients covered with a sweaty blanket of polyesterish cheese. The contrast makes Taste of Mexico, with its from-scratch cooking, generous portions and reasonable prices all the more refreshing and delicious.
2002-04-14	Creative, Consistent Fare in Peekskill	TOO often over the years, we've seen the demise of favored restaurants. Some thrive initially in this capricious market, and then we hear they've changed hands, changed formats or closed altogether. For those considering a foray into the restaurant business, Zephs' might present an interesting case study in stability: for a dozen years this family business has consistently provided creative American (albeit internationalized) cooking to a discerning clientele. Against a market that seems ever to expand into catering services and second dining spots, Victoria and Michael Zeph, a sister-and-brother team, maintain personal control over a modest and well-run restaurant. The formula for their success? Prices have not jumped over the years (entrees are still in the low 20's). The menu's few choices are refreshed regularly. After a hiatus, certain favorites are reintroduced. Ms. Zeph uses inexpensive ingredients -- no foie gras or other luxury foods on this menu -- she works with chicken, brisket and vegetables. And Mr. Zeph needs only one or two employees to help him manage the small dining room.
2002-04-07	Executive Pay: A Special Report; Tell the Good News. Then Cash In.	THE profits were an illusion. The multimillion-dollar rewards for executives were real. Over the last few years, executives at some companies released inaccurate earnings statements and, before correcting them, sold large amounts of stock at inflated prices. At others, executives insisted for months that the recent recession would not much affect their businesses. By the time they acknowledged their error, some had sold millions of shares at prices that were just a memory.
2002-04-07	Skip the Popcorn. There's Pasta and Pizza Nearby.	PIZZA parlors may be even more common in Connecticut than fast-food outlets. What gives La Cucina Brick Oven and Wine Bar in Fairfield a niche of its own are two factors: a number of nonpizza dishes on its menu and proximity to two movie complexes, making it a handy spot for catching a quick meal or snack before or after a movie. Of the two dining areas in La Cucina, the front one with an abundance of windows is lighter and airier, especially pleasing on a sunny day. The short, casual menu has a lightness too, with a dozen specialty pizzas, a few pasta dishes and only three standard entrees (veal rack, grilled New York strip and chicken). There are recited specials as well.
2002-04-03	$25 AND UNDER; Offshoot of a Thai Standby Takes a Turn for the West	WHEN I spotted a dish called jumbo shrimp on fire at Wondee Siam II, a bigger and more comfortable branch of one of my favorite Thai takeout spots, I naturally assumed I was in for a spicy treat. Thai cuisine is, of course, known for the liberal use of chili peppers, balanced with sweet, sour and salty flavors, which ideally exist in perfect harmony. Most Thai restaurants in New York tone down the spicing for Americans, so I was eager to try this dish. Pardon me for wrongful assumption of a metaphor.
2002-03-31	Making Out Like a Pirate With Polish Food	''SHIVER me timbers, it's Black Dog himself,'' exclaimed my companion, getting right into the spirit, as we entered Pirate, a restaurant in the heart of Norwalk. Sitting there, observing us (and all new arrivees) was an almost-lifelike rendering of a buccaneer, except this version looks benign, not sinister. No menacing Captain Hook he. Not just another theme restaurant, Pirate is a Polish restaurant. ''Why the name Pirate?'' we asked our waiter, wondering if there was some exotic history of Baltic Sea privateering that we didn't know about. ''One of the owners loves pirates,'' was the simple explanation. No romantic mystery here.
2002-03-30	I.R.S. to Seek Visa Card Data	Visa International will receive a summons from the Internal Revenue Service to turn over records of offshore accounts held by Americans suspected of evading taxes. A federal judge in San Francisco granted the I.R.S. authorization to get records from Visa as part of a widening investigation into tax evasion by people who hide their incomes in offshore banks and live off credit cards in the United States.
2002-03-26	NEWS SUMMARY	INTERNATIONAL A3-14 Arab Leaders in Beirut To Prepare for Summit Arab diplomats and foreign ministers, meeting in Beirut, Lebanon, in preparation for an Arab summit meeting, tried to overcome lingering tensions on how to treat Israel and Iraq and give life to a new Saudi peace initiative. A1 The Debate Over Arafat Israeli government officials said they were pessimistic over whether Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, would be allowed to attend the Arab summit meeting, even as the White House continued urging Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to let him go. The Palestinian information minister, Yasir Abed Rabbo, insisted that Mr. Arafat would go to the meeting, if allowed. A14
2002-03-26	I.R.S. Says Offshore Tax Evasion Is Widespread	The I.R.S. said yesterday that Americans in far greater numbers than it had once thought were evading taxes by secretly depositing money in tax havens like the Cayman Islands and withdrawing it using American Express, MasterCard and Visa cards. The I.R.S. said its estimate that one million to two million Americans might be using such accounts was based on records that it had obtained by summons from MasterCard of 230,000 bank accounts in three tax-haven countries.
2002-03-26	BUSINESS DIGEST	Wide Tax Evasion Is Seen With Offshore Credit Cards The I.R.S. said that Americans in far greater numbers than it had previously expected are evading income taxes by secretly depositing their money in tax havens like the Cayman Islands, where they have set up accounts allowing them to draw on their money with credit cards from American Express, Visa and MasterCard. The I.R.S. estimates that one million to two million Americans may be using such accounts. One prominent criminal tax lawyer said that the estimate was so out of proportion that he doubted it would hold up. [Page A1.]
2002-03-24	Double Portion	WITH about equal measures of pride and regret, Charles Moschini likes to say he opened Pronto Cena five years too early. It was 1990, and the notion that this battered waterfront town would one day become a magnet for the urban gentry seemed remote, if not ridiculous. Twelve years later, Pronto Cena fits so comfortably into its neighborhood -- a quiet block in the Paulus Hook section, behind the looming glass-and-steel office fortresses that make up Jersey City's new skyline -- as to be almost inconspicuous. A friend who was to meet me there one evening called me from his cellphone, sure that I'd given him the wrong address. He was standing in front of it.
2002-03-14	Some Japanese Are Hoarding Gold	While Japan has had the world's fastest-growing major stock market this year and the yen has jumped nearly 3 percent against the dollar in the last month, a small but growing number of Japanese investors are preparing for the worst and hoarding gold. With limits looming on bank deposit insurance, banks tottering under bad debts and the government printing money in an effort to create inflation, sales of gold are expected to come close to quadrupling this quarter, compared with the period last year, according to the World Gold Council, an industry group.
2002-03-10	Non, Non, Nouvelle	YOU can't miss it. Epernay is the restaurant on the corner of Park Street and Bloomfield Avenue with the two-story rooster on the wall. The mural, something of a Montclair landmark, long predates the restaurant, which is just 16 months old. (Mark Papera, the chef, says he was going to plant the name Epernay on his first child or his first restaurant, whichever arrived first. Close call: his wife and co-owner, Courtnay, is due in July.) But the big, jaunty rooster -- painted in 1980 by Thomas Reitter of Chatham -- nicely captures the Francophile élan of this bustling, thriving brasserie.
2002-03-06	$25 and Under; Soups, Sandwiches and the Essence of Elegance	FROM the soft leather banquette, the thick linens, the flattering lighting and the vaultlike designer bathrooms, it is clear that Craftbar, the new, casual adjunct to Craft, is something more than a knockoff of the humble Italian wine-and-sandwich shops that are its inspiration. In looks and service alone, Craftbar sets itself leagues beyond the typical low-rent sandwich shop. And yet, its snacks, soups, salads and sandwiches, supplemented each day by a meat, a fish and a pasta dish, exude the simplicity of a wine bar, where needs are joyfully met rather than challenged. In this way, Tom Colicchio, an owner and the chef of Craft and Gramercy Tavern, bridges the yawning divide between conceptually ambitious luxury restaurant and neighborhood hangout.
2002-02-24	One Rule Of Plastic: Recovery Has A Dark Side	THE economy appears to be improving, but that hasn't stopped a lot of people from worrying about looming credit difficulties for corporations. Similar concerns -- too much debt and slowing income growth -- hovered over consumers last year, but in most cases the companies that issue the plastic that shoppers use to ratchet up debt did just fine.
2002-02-20	Your Thumb Here: Newest ID of Choice At Store and on Job	Little blue discs with lids, about the size of 50-cent pieces, are glued on the counter close to each of the three cash registers at Sam's Package Store. When an unfamiliar customer writes a check, Peggi Parigi, owner of the store with her husband, asks for a driver's license, a place of work and a phone number. Then she points to a disc. ''I need a right thumbprint,'' she told Ann Harris, 46, who was paying $21.65 for a bottle of Royal Crown whiskey.
2002-02-17	At This Seaside Spot, Winter Doesn't Bite	THERE are few things more forlorn looking than a seaside place in the dead of winter. That thought crossed my mind on entering Harbor Lights, which faces Norwalk Harbor in East Norwalk. But then I noticed that the people who were seated at tables on the porch looked happy -- not freezing cold.
2002-02-16	Internet Offering Soars, Just Like Old Times	An Internet start-up goes public. It is not profitable -- in fact, it has lost hundreds of millions of dollars to date -- and faces competition from old-economy stalwarts. Yet on the first day of trading, investors go wild, pushing the company's stock up 60 percent. Sounds like 1999? It happened today.
2002-02-10	Spanish Food to Suit Eye, Taste and Pocket	IT was a freezing cold night and we were having trouble finding the Marbella Restaurant & Tapas Bar in Stratford on a busy thoroughfare. To top it off, when we arrived, the dining room was empty except for the staff, which greeted us effusively. I recognized the room, with its ivory walls and unexceptional pale tile floors, as the locale of the former Tristan, a Spanish restaurant with a short life span.
2002-02-07	VISA AND MASTERCARD WIN STAY OF RULING IN RIVALS CASE	Visa International Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. won a stay of a ruling that ordered them to let member banks distribute the credit cards of two rivals, the American Express Company and Discover Financial Services. Judge Barbara Jones of United States District Court in New York granted the credit card associations' request to suspend her Oct. 9 ruling until an appeals court reviews the case, company officials said. The Justice Department had sued under antitrust laws to force Visa and MasterCard, the two largest credit card brands, to allow the associations' 6,000 member banks to distribute other cards. Visa and MasterCard together control 75 percent of the $1.3 trillion credit card market.
2002-02-04	New Economy; A new stock offering should give some signal whether investors have forgiven Internet investments.	ARE investors ready to take a ride again on the Internet? An answer may become clearer with the initial public offering of Paypal, which provides a payment system for goods and services bought over the Internet.
2002-01-27	Suburban Renewal	FOR four and a half years, Cinque Figlie soldiered valiantly along in a spot that had all the advantages of a downtown storefront, and all the drawbacks. It was intimate, and it was cramped. It had a fine location in Morristown, and it had parking problems. It had no liquor license, so you could bring your own wine; it had no liquor license, so you had to bring your own wine. So last October, the restaurant did in effect what New Jerseyans have been doing for generations: it moved to the suburbs. The new home is a prosperous-looking turn-of-the-last-century frame house on a spacious lot in nearby Whippany -- a building that diners of a certain age (like mine) will remember as Le Délice, John Foy's ambitious French restaurant in the 1980's, and later as Alfredo's.
2002-01-27	For Families, a 'Camp-Out' With Menus	AS we sat in a booth in the dining room of Bear & Grill in Fairfield, marveling at the handsome rendering of the Adirondacks, my companion said, ''All that's missing are the black flies, thank goodness.'' We noted all the woodsy touches: the tree-branch pine railings like those of a typical Adirondacks porch, the fieldstone-framed kitchen window simulating a hearth, the cabin-style lamps hung just above each table and booth.
2002-01-23	$25 AND UNDER; A Neighborhood Wine Bar With a Provençal Accent	THE full-scale arrival of Italian wine-and-panini shops in the last few years has been a great thing, especially for the neighborhoods lucky enough to get a good one. The combination of salads and sandwiches made with simple, fresh ingredients, along with wines available by the glass, make these the perfect informal hangouts, whether by day when the rest of the world is either at work or at Starbucks or for the after-hours crowd. It stands to reason, then, that entrepreneurs would seek to extend the brand, so to speak. Voilà Paradou, a panini shop born of a different Mediterranean coast where the specialty is ''sandwichs grillés,'' as they would say in Provence.
2002-01-21	A Credit Crisis for Web Casinos; Card Companies Are Growing Wary of Online Betting	Mining the margins of legality, operators of Internet casinos assumed their big worry was regulators and law enforcement agencies. Lately, though, it seems that the online casinos have a more immediate problem: the growing number of credit card companies and banks that are refusing to process payments for Internet gambling. Although demand by bettors remains brisk, whether they are wagering on sporting events or online games like roulette and blackjack, the credit card companies are concluding that the business is more trouble than it is worth. Internet gambling is illegal in many states, and some types of wagering are barred by federal laws. But beyond that, customers frequently deny having placed bets or simply refuse to pay their credit card bills after running up large gambling debts.
2002-01-20	Personal Business; Consumer Tools for Holding Bill Collectors at Bay	WHEN Stacey Edwards, an employee of the Florida juvenile justice system, moved out of her apartment complex in Tallahassee last July, she didn't think there would be any problems. After all, she said, she had given what she believed to be proper notice and left the apartment in good condition. But last month, without hearing a word from the apartment managers, she said she began receiving telephone calls from a debt collection agency demanding $815 for unpaid rent and cleaning fees. A collector from Professional Debt Mediation in Jacksonville had called her four times at work, she said, asking for payment -- and to be transferred to the personnel office so he could start garnishing her wages. ''I was in tears on the telephone,'' said Ms. Edwards, 34.
2002-01-17	PROVIDIAN SELLS $8.2 MILLION IN CREDIT CARD LOANS	The Providian Financial Corporation, a leading issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, has agreed to sell its proceeds from $8.2 billion in credit card loans to J. P. Morgan Chase & Company to raise cash and satisfy regulators. The loans, about one-quarter of its business, are with Providian's most creditworthy customers. Providian, based in San Francisco, is trying to find a buyer for $3 billion in loans to customers with poor or short credit histories. In November, federal regulators told Providian to improve its capital ratios, measures of the company's cushion against unexpected loan losses, after profit plunged because of an increase in the number of customers with blemished credit who could not pay their credit card bills.
2002-01-14	E-Commerce Report; Credit card companies go to great lengths online to develop products that will corral teenage consumers.	FOR Internet retailers, the teenage market is much like the China market. Both are huge and largely inaccessible because the targets speak completely different languages than most mainstream American merchants. E-tailers simply cannot ignore the under-18 population, since this group spends roughly $155 billion a year in the United States, according to Teen Research Unlimited, a consulting firm. And 80 percent of those teenagers are online already. But they spend a paltry $1 billion of their cash online, according to Jupiter Media, an Internet research firm, a level that speaks to the inability of online merchants to entice teenagers to do more than download free music, play games and ping each other with instant messages.
2002-01-13	Sketches of Spain	BARCELONA, a year-old restaurant in this carefully preserved Colonial hamlet just north of the Bergen County line, is like one of those trompe l'oeil murals intended to fool you into thinking the phone booth you've just entered is actually the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Only here the illusion works in reverse. From the street, the restaurant looks like a storefront bistro in a strip mall. Its neighbors include a dry cleaner and a nail salon. It's when you enter that you realize that things were not what they seemed from the street.
2002-01-13	A Handsome Steakhouse in Greenwich	WE had just settled into a corner table at Greenwich Steakhouse, a smart-looking new establishment that was the quarters of the now defunct 64 Greenwich Avenue, when one one of my companions said, ''How come all the most stylish restaurants in the state are in Greenwich?'' Such a provocative question led to various rebuttals from others in our group. But everyone agreed that Greenwich has more than its share of first-rate, high-end places to truly dine -- and not just to eat.
2002-01-09	$25 AND UNDER; Sandwiches Worthy of the Pedigree	NOTE from the Department of Heightened Expectations: If you're going to call your cafe Bread, the bread had better be really good. On that score, this little Italian cafe, which opened last summer, does not disappoint. Crusty, irresistible slices of rustic peasant bread, from the Balthazar Bakery a few blocks west, arrive with the menus, standing upright in a cylindrical silver container like frites in an aluminum cone. No, Bread doesn't bake its own, but when a restaurant specializes in sandwiches and salads, ingredients are the most important thing.
2002-01-05	The Prescient Playwright	In Tony Kushner's new play ''Homebody/Kabul,'' Linda Emond plays the Homebody, a middle-aged Englishwoman, who is sitting in a comfortable chair in her London home, reading a slender book when the lights come up. Mr. Kushner wrote the play, now at the New York Theater Workshop in the East Village, before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the action takes place in 1998. These excerpts are from Ms. Emond's opening monologue. ''Our story begins at the very dawn of history, circa 3000 B.C. . . .''
2001-12-26	$25 AND UNDER; Afghan Fare That Recalls Earlier Times	FOR a bittersweet fantasy of an alternative reality, walk down a flight of steps at Pamir, an Afghan restaurant that has held down a corner at Second Avenue and 75th Street for more than 20 years. Framed on the wall is a tourist brochure for Afghanistan, circa 1975, touting in words and photos the exotic sights of a country that since then has known little but violence and destruction. The familiar names constitute an Edenic ''before'' to the ingrained images of an apocalyptic ''after.'' Visit lovely Kandahar, the brochure invites, ''the city where modern Afghanistan began.'' See the great mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif; marvel at the monumental Buddhas of Bamian carved into a mountainside.
2001-12-12	$25 AND UNDER; In the East Village, Vietnamese With a Touch of French	DINNER gets going late at Vicala, a new restaurant in the East Village that bills itself as nouveau Vietnamese. Arrive at 8 p.m. and you may be alone in the pleasantly dim dining room. By 9, things start to pick up and by 10:30, especially on the weekends, Vicala is rocking. The gentrification that has embraced much of the East Village has come slowly to Avenue C. But Vicala is a step up in looks and in ambition. The minimalist dining room, done in shades of gray and black with sleek wood banquettes, is a stylish suit on an avenue full of ragged jeans. It was designed by the chef, Michael Huynh, one of four partners in the restaurant, who is also an architect. Mr. Huynh's cooking is likewise sleek, fusing French techniques with Asian flavorings, resulting in exalted dishes with Vietnamese roots.
2001-12-03	Visa Starts Password Service to Fight Online Fraud	Something seems backward about the way that credit card companies have used the Internet. If you want to see your balance or pay your bill online, you will need to log on to the credit card company's site with a password. But to spend money on other sites, all you need is the card number itself, the same one available to anyone who finds a stray receipt or picks the wallet from your pocket. Of course, the cardholder is not liable if someone goes on a cybershopping spree with a purloined number. But disentangling the fraud is a problem. And the banks and merchants have to absorb the loss.
2001-12-02	Scarce Jobs and Dashed Hopes For the Class of 2001	BILLY TILSON remembers the good times. The days when looking for a job meant sorting through competing offers. When companies sought to sell themselves to him during interviews, rather than the other way around. ''All the companies were fighting over me,'' Mr. Tilson said. ''Everyone was hiring and the companies were bending over backwards for you. It was a lot of fun.''
2001-11-25	After a Glimpse or Two, the Choice Is Thai	OUR visit to Thai Pan Asian, a new restaurant in New Haven, was serendipitous. We had left the Yale Repertory Theater after a matinee and were walking along Chapel Street, trying to decide whether to dine in town or drive elsewhere. Then, in passing, we glanced in at the well-napped tables, the scraped brick wall and the fresh-looking interior.
2001-11-18	The Seafood Is Fresh, and So Is the Decor	WHAT does Running Fish have to do with the restaurant 62 Main Street in New Canaan? A lot. 62 Main Street closed recently after less than a year, but quickly morphed into Running Fish. The ownership is the same, but there is a brighter decor and a new menu featuring -- surprise! -- fresh fish. Presumably, when the fish are running, they are running right into this kitchen.
2001-11-07	$25 AND UNDER; A True Taste of Vietnam, but With a Parisian Feel	I COULDN'T help feeling bittersweet on my first visit to Nam, a handsome new Vietnamese restaurant in TriBeCa not so far from the World Trade Center site. Whenever I go to a restaurant for the first time, I feel a mixture of anticipation, hope and sometimes a little dread. But this was different. I had not expected the thankful looks on the faces of the waiters as I entered for lunch on a sunny afternoon, when few tables were occupied. Nor had I anticipated that, each time the door opened, I would receive a faintly acrid reminder of Sept. 11. I'm not complaining. If anything, to dine within breathing distance of the World Trade Center is at once humbling and enriching, a reminder to take pleasure in simple joys like eating. Nam's Vietnamese dishes, quietly linked to centuries of culinary tradition yet thoroughly unpretentious and delicately delicious, were the perfect accompaniment to these odd moments of rumination.
2001-11-04	A Varied Menu, Pork Chops a Specialty	AFTER a day of shop-hopping through Litchfield, we found ourselves at dinner time in New Milford at Kaleidoscope, a smart new restaurant nestled into a hillside locale across from the train station. While perusing the menu I noticed the smoked pork chop from the Egg & I, the retail shop of a pork farm we had visited earlier in the day, and pounced on it.
2001-10-28	A Japanese Cuisine With Style and Spark	EXCEPT for the dolls, the folk art and the doodads for sale above and behind the sushi bar, Yooki Yama in Branford looks like many other Japanese storefront restaurants. No special frills. No special ethnicity. What is different about Yooki Yama, though, is the menu.
2001-10-20	SHARES OF PROVIDIAN, CREDIT CARD CONCERN, TUMBLE	Shares in the Providian Financial Corporation fell 58 percent yesterday after the company, which issues Visa and MasterCard credit cards, said losses were mounting and its chief executive would resign. Stock in the company, which is based in San Francisco, closed down $7.25, to $5.15. Shares fell 34 percent a week ago when Providian said it would report lower third-quarter earnings than it projected in early September. Profit fell 71 percent in the three months, the company said yesterday.
2001-10-20	Friend Stole Tower Victim's Card, Police Charge	For Cantor Fitzgerald, the brokerage firm devastated by the World Trade Center attacks, it was yet another piece of bad news. Already reeling from the loss of 700 employees in the attack, the company learned yesterday that one of its missing employees, Laura Gilly, 33, had become a victim again, this time at the hands of a friend with whom she had worked at the company.
2001-10-13	SHARES OF PROVIDIAN, CREDIT CARD ISSUER, FALL SHARPLY	Shares of Providian Financial fell as much as 34 percent after the company said yesterday that third-quarter earnings were about 75 percent lower than expected because more people could not pay their credit card bills. Shares of Providian, the fifth-largest issuer of MasterCard and Visa credit cards, fell $6.90, to $13.45. Other credit card issuers also tumbled. Providian, whose customers include people with weak credit histories, said that earnings were 19 cents to 21 cents a share in the quarter. On Sept. 4, it expected to earn 82 cents to 84 cents. Lenders to people with high debt-to-income ratios may have more difficulty than other credit card companies in coming months, particularly if the economy does not rebound soon, analysts said.
2001-10-10	BUSINESS DIGEST	Supreme Court Rejects Latest Microsoft Appeal The Supreme Court rejected a request by Microsoft to consider throwing out the government's antitrust lawsuit because of misconduct by the federal trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson. The decision clears the way for another judge to consider the most appropriate penalty for Microsoft's antitrust violations. That judge has ordered lawyers from the company, the federal government and the states to engage in settlement talks, but the nearly two weeks of talks have so far been fruitless, several participants said. Shares of Microsoft fell $3.48, to $54.56. [Page C2.]
2001-10-10	Visa and MasterCard Ordered To Allow Rival Cards at Banks	Visa International Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. must end their practice of barring member banks from distributing rivals' credit cards, a federal judge ruled yesterday. The Justice Department had sued to force Visa and MasterCard to allow their 6,000 member banks to distribute other credit cards, like American Express and Discover. The government also sought to end joint control of Visa and MasterCard by some of the nation's largest banks.
2001-09-30	Bistro Basics	ONE thing you will never do is stumble across Chez Dominique by accident. It sits on a sad-eyed side street in this blue-collar borough in Bergen County's midsection, in a faded downtown dreaming of urban renewal. Its next-door neighbor is a pool hall. But for some reason this forlorn address has been home to fine French bistros for more than a decade. First there was Chez Madeleine, which built a faithful base of customers on a dependable menu of well-turned standards. When its owners, Gaspard and Madeleine Caloz, decamped last year for grander quarters up the road in Northvale, Dominique Peyraudeau moved right in.
2001-09-19	$25 AND UNDER; Warm and Welcoming, and Aspiring to More	BISTRO TEN 18 in Morningside Heights ought to be a perfect neighborhood restaurant. Its handsome bar invites hanging out, and the stone fireplace promises to be as warming as a family hearth once the weather turns cold. The staff is welcoming, and it's owned by a mother and son, Carol Weissman and Craig Skiptunis. What more could you want? Not much, at least not last week, when many in the neighborhood sought psychological refuge with family and friends there, quietly discussing the attack on the World Trade Center, sometimes moving from table to table, fostering just the sort of community one hopes to find in such a spot.
2001-09-16	A Tuscan Menu in a Warm, Stylish Setting	OH, you've been here before?'' I asked my friends after we were seated at Il Palio, a new restaurant in Shelton. The welcoming warmth and friendliness of the hostess at the door made me think they were recognized patrons. But no, they had suggested Il Palio because it was in their neighborhood, and they knew I was always looking for something new and promising. Il Palio fits both descriptions nicely.
2001-09-06	Setting Out The Snares For Hackers	THE break-in came on June 4, 2000, at 11:37 a.m. The target was a Sun Sparc5 computer sitting in the spare bedroom of a suburban Chicago house. The perpetrator probed the computer's operating system for a well-known vulnerability. When he found it, he attacked by sending a small piece of code that exploited the weakness and opened a backdoor to the system's most sensitive areas.
2001-09-05	PROVIDIAN FINANCIAL CUTS EARNINGS FORECAST	The Providian Financial Corporation, a leading issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, cut its 2001 earnings outlook, saying customer purchases and loan demand had weakened. The announcement set off a 22 percent decline in the company's stock price, which fell $8.70, to $30.36 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. Providian said it would earn $3.20 to $3.25 a share for the year, short of the $3.28 estimated by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.
2001-09-05	$25 AND UNDER; A Bold Move Beyond Grilled Beef and Koreatown	KOREAN restaurants have now established themselves in Manhattan beyond their familiar Herald Square zone. The next step, Dae Jin Hwang says, is to show Americans that Korean restaurants have a lot more to offer than grilled beef. Mr. Hwang's first restaurant, Mandoo Bar, was a step in that direction, specializing in house-made dumplings. But it was still situated in Koreatown. His new place, Muzy, which opened in May in the East Village, is a bolder break from the past, offering a small menu of light appetizers and noodle dishes, with just a few meat-oriented selections and a choice of fresh juices.
2001-08-26	Amid a Summer Feel, a Taste of France	FIRST came Splash in Westport. Now in Stratford there is a new French restaurant (totally unrelated) whose name, Plouf!, means splash in French. What next, a Spanish Salpique! or a German der Spritzer!
2001-08-12	For a Song	DA FILIPPO AUTENTICA CUCINA ITALIANO has the kind of menu that makes me wish for a python-style digestive system. That way, I could order everything on the menu, eat, and then slide off to someplace dark to digest. Next best, though, is going there with friends and sharing. We each ordered something different, to the approval of the waiter.
2001-08-12	CREDIT CARD CHIPS WITH LITTLE TO DO	Suddenly, smart cards -- credit cards embedded with tiny computer chips -- are everywhere. American Express put a chip on its sparkly new Blue card, and issued 2.2 million of them in just 14 months. Rushing to mimic Blue's success, Visa says at least four of its banks will issue seven million credit cards with chips on them this year. And MasterCard says it is getting into the smart card business, too. The cards may be smart, but so far they haven't showed it. In contrast to Europe, where smart cards have been used for a decade to fight fraud and reduce telecommunications costs, there is hardly anything that can be done with one in the United States.
2001-08-05	Asian Cuisines Blending Under One Roof	THE latest in Connecticut's mini-food empires is Wild Ginger Cafe in Ridgefield, a sibling of Ching's Table in New Canaan and the Penang Grill in Greenwich. The emphasis in all three restaurants is on southeast Asian cuisines: Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, China and Indonesia.
2001-07-28	Credit Cards on Campus	Credit card marketers will be back on college campuses come fall semester. They will stand near bookstores, student unions and stadiums, urging students to fill out credit applications and handing out free T-shirts and plastic sunglasses in return. Credit card issuers are eager to reach the college market and universities are eager to offer up their student populations. But their marketing zeal should obligate them to be equally aggressive in educating the students on credit and personal finance. Colleges and universities are often well compensated for permitting credit card companies to set up on their campuses. Many schools have agreements that permit card issuers to market to university alumni, students and employees on campus and issue cards bearing the university's name in exchange for royalties paid to the university. In one such agreement, First USA, one of the largest issuers of Visa and MasterCard, will pay the University of Oklahoma $13 million over 10 years and give the school 0.4 percent of every purchase charged to the university cards, as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education.
2001-07-18	$25 AND UNDER; A Movable Chef Stirs Things Up in Park Slope	THE subtle blue storefront of Bistro St. Mark's sits on a nondescript block on the fringe of Park Slope. It blends so inconspicuously with the surroundings that on my first visit I walked by twice before realizing, with a double take, that I was right at the door. A look at the menu provokes a double take, too, because this is no simple bistro fare. Like al di là in Park Slope and the Grocery in Carroll Gardens, two other leaders in the Brooklyn dining revolution, Bistro St. Mark's uses the guise of neighborhood conviviality to cloak serious and creative cooking. The relative anonymity of the place and the excitement within are fitting, since Bistro St. Mark's is where Johannes Sanzin has resurfaced. Five years ago, Mr. Sanzin was a partner in two Manhattan restaurants, Sanzin in SoHo and 131 Duane Street in TriBeCa, which both earned glowing reviews. But Mr. Sanzin and his partners quarreled, then split up, and the restaurants closed. When next heard from, Mr. Sanzin had opened a pair of soup and sandwich carryout spots in Lower Manhattan with Dominique Drevet, who, like Mr. Sanzin, had worked at Bouley. A year ago, they sold the shops and moved to the lower-pressure climes of Brooklyn. Bistro St. Mark's opened last month.
2001-07-04	$25 AND UNDER; Reinventing the Local Diner for a Bohemian Community	DINERS for the most part are bygone expressions of Americana in the same way egg creams are relics of New York City's past. Decades ago diners were community hubs, slinging the sort of hash that was standard fare at the time, rich and pliable enough symbolically to fit into the universes of both Edward Hopper and Norman Rockwell. As the world moved on, diners carved new niches, gussied up as nostalgia baths or revved up with huge multinational menus listing duck à l'orange and stuffed lobster, though selling mostly burgers. No longer central to a community, they clung to the edges, beckoning to New Yorkers as they rushed past to Burger King or Starbucks.
2001-07-01	Truffles and Flourishes	JOCELYNE was a college professor. Mitchell was a chef. They met at a party in the French wine village of Sauternes, where he happened to be cooking in a local restaurant. They struck up a conversation. That was 12 years ago. Soon -- you knew this was coming -- they were married. As Mr. and Mrs. Altholz, they returned to his home state, New Jersey (he grew up in Edison), and began working in local restaurants. On Valentine's Day 1998, they opened their own place. Mitchell named it after Jocelyne. ''My father really liked the name,'' he explained, and added, after a pause, ''It's my love.''
2001-07-01	Scenic Spot for Seafood and Other Dishes	DESPITE the name Pesce (Italian for fish), this attractive and low-key restaurant has only three seafood entrées on its short menu, though there are two more among the specials. At the same time, four of the five appetizers are seafood friendly. When we first saw the clapboard house with its full view down Main Street in Branford, we knew we had been there before. Sure enough, what had been Cafe Bella Vita was now Pesce.
2001-07-01	A Special Invitation (to Anyone)	LIKE most of us, Ann Hamman is deluged with mail offering ''preapproved'' credit cards and various lines of credit from banks and financial services companies, large and small. Gold cards, platinum cards, titanium cards. Credit lines of as much as $100,000. Unlike most of us, however, Mrs. Hamman, 93, never sees them. That is because she has been in an assisted-living residence in Homestead, Fla., for more than a year. She suffers from memory problems and needs help with daily activities; she cannot prepare meals or manage a bank account. Her mail goes to her son, Henry Hamman, who lives nearby in Miami.
2001-06-24	Spanish Food With Tidbits as a Specialty	FINO TAPAS in Greenwich is the latest restaurant to latch on to the mini-craze for Spanish food. As aficionados, we were pleased to see the exclusively Spanish wine list (from $25 a bottle, $7 a glass), as such wines make ideal companions for tapas, which obviously command center stage here.
2001-06-20	Why Juan Won't Save; Financial Services Industry Fails to Reach Many Hispanics	Guadalupe Avita has been living in the United States for 10 years, but only recently opened a bank account. An immigrant from Sinaloa, Mexico, Ms. Avita used to keep thousands of dollars in her home in the Los Angeles area. Without proper documentation for identification -- like a Social Security number -- she assumed it would be impossible to open a bank account. After her sister was robbed, Ms. Avita, a single mother, was fearful that she, too, would lose her savings. ''I always worried,'' she said.
2001-05-27	A Full Plate	THE hostess snatches a stack of menus and stalks to our table without a backward glance. We have been bad; we are 10 minutes late for our 5:30 reservation. She is further vexed that our guests haven't arrived. She hopes they show up soon, she says, because there's another seating at 8:30 and the restaurant has to have the table. She distributes the menus and flounces off, her animal print dress flowing behind her. A good scolding does wonders for the appetite, doesn't it? In a few minutes our guests join us at Acacia, a restaurant that consistently wins good marks in the Zagat guide and often is recommended as a place to go for special occasions.
2001-05-20	A French Treat for Palate (and Pocket, Too)	IF the Le Petit Cafe in Branford were a movie, it might be titled ''The Miracle on Montowese Street.'' What other way is there to describe a restaurant that is able to serve a memorable prix fixe dinner for $35? This tiny enterprise facing the Branford green opened several years ago. It was then sold to Roy and Winnie Ip, who for a brief time turned it into a gourmet market and catering service.
2001-05-13	Saigon, N.J.	VIETNAM has a long and noble history of incorporating other cuisines into its own. Colonized by the Chinese for 10 centuries, and later by the French, it absorbed their influences along with those of the Indians and Portuguese who passed through on trade routes. It could probably claim to have invented fusion cooking. So Cedar Lane, the long, broad, sloping strip that is Teaneck's main commercial artery, is an apt setting for one of Bergen County's few Vietnamese restaurants. Over the years, as the town flourished through successive waves of middle-class ethnic migration -- Dutch, European Jewish, African-American, Asian, Latino, Muslim, Israeli -- Cedar Lane has become a fusion capital. The Web site of its Special Improvement District (www.cedarlane.net) boasts two dozen restaurants, from the venerable Louie's Charcoal Pit to Fliegel's Fast Food, Mexicali Blues and Jerusalem Pizza -- and now the 17-month-old East Saigon.
2001-05-09	$25 AND UNDER; A Korean Sidewalk Cafe Fits In on the Upper East Side	SECOND AVENUE in the 80's is like one big open-air restaurant in the warm spring weather. The glass storefronts swing open, extending dining rooms onto sidewalks, where tables from one place to the next form blocklong parties. Emo's, a handsome new restaurant a couple of months old, has blended seamlessly into this seasonal expression of high spirits. Nothing remarkable there, except that Emo's is Korean. A Korean restaurant outside the confines of Midtown is no longer that unusual. Yet, I can't help thinking that assimilation has taken a major step forward when the conservative frat-house atmosphere that characterizes this stretch of the Upper East Side embraces a restaurant like Emo's. What makes this especially noteworthy is that, aside from American-style service and the addition of fresh salad greens to several dishes, Emo's pulls few punches, offering robust, spicy, authentic fare that is full of flavor.
2001-05-08	As Jobs Are Lost, Consumers Slow Increase in Borrowing	Consumers added to their debt far more gingerly in March as they curbed spending on autos and other big-ticket items. The pullback by consumers, who spent and borrowed heavily earlier in the year, came after a sharp increase in corporate layoffs and could suggest that the economic downturn might deepen.
2001-05-06	Asian-Caribbean Dishes Mingle and Mesh	WHAT goes around comes around. It is probably only fitting that the sizeable space now occupied by Momos Jazz Brasserie once rocked with the rhythms of Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie. That was in the 60's.
2001-04-29	Tuscan on the Hudson	FULL disclosure: This Hudson River village, 10 minutes north of Bergen County, is where I grew up in the 1950's and 60's. In my day, though Nyack had its charms, fine dining was not among them. It was a stolid workingman's town, home to shoe factories and meat markets and secondhand stores. Aside from taverns and luncheonettes, I remember only one restaurant -- a Chinese place whose egg rolls could have served as ballast down at Julius Petersen's Boat Yard. These days, Nyack has the word ''charming'' written all over it. Solidly established as the antiques-and-crafts capital of the lower Hudson Valley, it seems to have shrugged off competition from the gargantuan Palisades Center mall, a mile up the New York State Thruway. Its graceful streetscapes, many looking down to the river and the twinkling expanse of the Tappan Zee, are thickly planted with Victorian houses -- houses that I remember as badly needing paint, but now turning up in real estate ads with million-dollar price tags -- and high-end restaurants.
2001-04-29	Familiar Italian Menu in a Quaint Setting	PASQUALE'S OSTERIA belongs on a quiet country road in Italy, rather than on a commercial strip in Norwalk. The restaurant, a one-story house with a grassy lawn, two birch trees and a four-tiered fountain, was so attractive in a sweetly old-fashioned way that we rooted for the food to be agreeable as well.
2001-04-22	Feeling Right at Home	GOING to Enzo's must be like finding a speakeasy. Turn at the video store and drive in to a four-car parking lot just a few feet off the road. Note the small sign that directs you to the side lot for additional parking and the string of white lights that marks the place as a restaurant. Step into the deserted hall and other than a utilitarian staircase in front of you and a few framed newspaper clippings and pictures, there's not much there. Swing open the narrow doors, though, and a pleasant hubbub rises to greet you. More often than not, the tables are full and there's lively conversation against the clink of silverware on china. Then there are the aromas. Surely no speakeasy could produce such a heady mix of pasta boiling and tomato sauce simmering, seafood grilling and bread baking.
2001-04-22	A Cozy Fit of Japanese and Korean Dishes	WHAT distinguishes Ichigo on the Westport edge of Norwalk from other modest storefront Japanese restaurants is its menu: half Japanese and half Korean. Some of the newer Asian restaurants in Connecticut have combined Chinese cuisine with a Japanese sushi bar. But Japanese and Korean cuisines are a more natural fit.
2001-04-18	$25 AND UNDER; For Those Who Run From Eat-on-the-Run Pizza	NO matter how rubbery the cheese or sodden the crust, pizza almost always finds a way to satisfy. Too often, though, the reflex pleasure in consuming a slice on the street obscures the significant differences between junk food and the real thing. The best pizzas are quick works of simple art, delicate and carefully composed, with the best ingredients. And the pleasure they produce is of a completely different order from the short-lived rush of an ordinary pizza. To feel the difference, try one of the individual Neapolitan pizzas at Risa, a small second-floor oasis of spacious sanity in the overheated restaurant climes of SoHo.
2001-04-18	For the Stock-Weary, Online Bond Trading	STEPHEN CALARDO, a lawyer in Cincinnati, has been buying and selling stocks online for years, but he does not remember when he last bought a bond before this year. Bonds issued by government agencies and corporations have been available for electronic trading for a few years, but the idea is just starting to catch on with investors now that the stock market is in a funk. Having watched the value of their stock-heavy portfolios hurtle toward earth like the Mir space station, investors are looking for safer places to put their money. Some, including Mr. Calardo, are finding that they can buy other securities online almost as quickly and inexpensively as they can trade stocks.
2001-04-15	Amid Elegance, a Variety of Indian Dishes	IN terms of decor, Nirvana has done as much as possible to fulfill one meaning of its name: a place or state characterized by freedom from or oblivion to pain, worry or the external world. One might also add peaceful and otherworldly. In short, this new restaurant in New Haven, situated diagonally across the street from the Yale Repertory Theater, is probably the prettiest Indian restaurant we have visited in Connecticut. One might not suspect this, judging from the rough stone-fronted exterior. But stepping into the dining room is like visiting the Lake Palace in Udaipur, an oasis of serenity with soft, undulating Indian music in the background.
2001-04-08	No-Frills Fish	THERE are two ways to ruin a piece of good fish: Overcook it or overembellish it. At the Blue Point Grill, a tiny exposed-brick place on the fringes of Princeton's downtown, the kitchen rarely commits the first sin. And in my visits there, it has never committed the second. The Blue Point Grill is a place to go if you are craving really good fish, if your main goal is sliding your fork into a tender, fresh-from-the-sea-flavored slab, carving a big bite and moving it into your mouth long before it's cool enough to eat. It's the place to go if you're thinking of fat oysters glistening against their shells, the lemon wedge a tart promise of interplay with the briny living custards. It's the place to go if you absolutely must have fresh sardines hot off the grill and dressed with olive oil because you can't afford to go to Italy and it has been another relentlessly gray spring day in New Jersey.
2001-04-08	Southern Italian Fare Takes Up Residence	IN a space that for years has been something of a revolving door, a new Italian restaurant called Seminara's is now ensconced. Despite its Post Road address, the restaurant is in Colonial Green, a small shopping complex in Westport that is set back from the road. The location, which is out of the immediate view of the road, may have a lot to do with the many changeovers.
2001-04-04	$25 AND UNDER; When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Hungry	EVEN with all the jitters over the economy, restaurants that offer elaborate $18 appetizers and luxurious $30 main courses continue to open in Manhattan. But Inside takes another tack. It was opened two months ago by Anne Rosenzweig, who lived through the recession of the late 1980's at Arcadia, and Charleen Badman, her sous-chef at the Lobster Club, and it has the stripped-down appearance and simplified approach of a place ready for leaner economic times. Rococo embellishments and status ingredients have been cast aside, yet this is no glorified diner.
2001-04-01	A Passage to Japan	MY first visit to Raku was, I suspect, like many an American tourist's first night in Japan. I wasn't sure what I'd let myself in for. I was curious but wary and disoriented. This was not for any lack of effort on the part of my hosts, who were as warm and attentive as any I'd ever encountered. The problem was that Raku's address is misleading. It may say Westwood, N.J., but it's really on the other side of the planet.
2001-04-01	Pan-Asian (and Italian) on the Creative Side	WHEN we made dinner reservations at Wish Cafe in Stamford, we were told the food served was Pan-Asian. The sign outside said ''innovative cuisine.'' Both descriptions were accurate. Asian ingredients and a few Japanese dishes were clearly evident on the menu (along with several Italian specialties), but the talented chef, Michael Stoddard, has traveled beyond merely replicating into genuinely creative territory.
2001-03-29	The Casino on the Desktop; Bettors, Veteran or Novice, Find the Lure of Online Gambling Hard to Resist	THE plastic white magnolias just inside the front door of Cheryl G.'s one-bedroom apartment here are impeccably arranged. She has carefully bent each petal to make them seem more natural. She keeps the carpets freshly vacuumed. And she fixes the flowered bedspread so crisply each morning that hospital administrators would applaud. Those touches reflect the control that Cheryl G., 48, ordinarily exhibits in her life.
2001-03-25	American Flavors, Plus a Wee Bit of Irish	THE name may be a bit off-putting to those who think all they will encounter at Druid Restaurant in Stamford is an Irish menu. Nothing wrong with that, of course, if one is in the mood. Instead of prehistoric Celtic spirits, we found an amiable, youthful Irish staff and were also pleasantly surprised to find a quiet atmosphere totally different from the rollicking Gaelic Temple Bar on the floor below. Even more of a happy surprise was the contemporary American menu, with a handful of Irish specialties, such as shepherd's pie and corned beef and cabbage.
2001-03-21	$25 AND UNDER; A Moroccan Outpost in the Shadow of the Port Authority	BEYOND Lotfi's, a theater district old-timer, and one or two others, Moroccan restaurants have been as rare as starry nights in Manhattan. But in the last year several new ones have opened, including Le Souk in the East Village, Sago on the Lower East Side and Tagine near the Port Authority Bus Terminal. While the East Village and the Lower East Side have authentic bohemian credentials, both neighborhoods are in metamorphosis, as art galleries and boutiques redecorate the streets. The new Moroccans downtown reflect their neighborhoods' heightened sense of style. But Ninth Avenue near the bus terminal is as gritty and nondescript as ever. Though Tagine is self-conscious enough to call itself a ''dining gallery,'' it is, in the true bohemian spirit, a low-budget operation.
2001-03-13	Hard Lobbying On Debtor Bill Pays Dividend	A lobbying campaign led by credit card companies and banks that gave millions of dollars in political donations to members of Congress and contributed generously to President Bush's 2000 campaign is close to its long-sought goal of overhauling the nation's bankruptcy system. Legislation that would make it harder for people to wipe out their debts could be passed by the Senate as early as this week. The bill has already been approved by the House, and Mr. Bush has pledged to sign it.
2001-02-25	Yorkville's Foreign Accents	LUCA + (212) 987-9260; 1712 First Avenue, near 89th Street; $$; no smoking; Visa and Mastercard. The antipasto for two is so generous at this good-looking restaurant that you'll never think of the dish in the same way again. Other starters include mussels sautéed with garlic, and parsley in a white wine broth; puff pastry with poached pears and gorgonzola cheese; and sautéed quails with shiitake mushrooms over greens. Entrees include potato-crusted salmon fillet; crispy Cornish hen served with sautéed vegetables; and a Milanese stew of pork ribs, sausages and cabbage served with soft polenta. ($25 and Under: 10/28/98)
2001-02-14	$25 AND UNDER; In Brooklyn, a Bistro Comes Into Its Own	AMONG the French bistros that dominate the Smith Street restaurant row in Brooklyn, Smith Street Kitchen alone specializes in seafood. And perhaps best of all, the restaurant offers excellent value, especially now, when prices have risen and few fish restaurants are accessible to diners on a moderate budget. With its worn velvet banquettes, handsome pressed tin walls and black-and-white photos, the small dining room has an inviting lived-in look. Service is solicitous without being overfriendly, and the restaurant takes its obligations seriously. When we had to wait 45 minutes past our reservation time one night because of a slow-to-leave table, we were offered a free bottle of sparkling wine, an all-too-rare indication that a restaurant was concerned with our plight.
2001-02-07	Wachovia Bank Weighs Sale Of Its Credit Card Business	The Wachovia Corporation said yesterday that it might join a growing list of banks getting out of the credit card business, rather than compete with companies spending heavily to woo fickle consumers with promotions. With about $8 billion in receivables, Wachovia ranks as the 12th-largest issuer of bank credit cards, according to The Nilson Report, a publication in Oxnard, Calif., that tracks the credit card industry.
2001-02-06	The Postal Service is going right along with the trend of putting ads on everything in sight.	THE United States Postal Service is accelerating plans to offer marketers advertising space to peddle private goods and services in places where paid pitches had never appeared until last year, including on the sides of mail trucks and collection boxes, in post office lobbies and on the service's Web site. The post office is introducing what executives are calling the Postal Ad Network, grouping properties for sale to advertisers in the same manner that media conglomerates like Advance Publications and Walt Disney do. The goal is to sell ad space on postal assets -- expanding a program that brought ads in 2000 from America Online, Universal Pictures and Visa International -- to offset rising costs for fuel, real estate and labor.
2001-02-04	Small World	ORBIS BISTRO has no fireplace, but on bleak winter nights it casts a warm yellow glow down its quiet block in this inviting section of Upper Montclair, a streetscape of well-tended brick storefronts and gabled houses from the 1910's and 20's. From the outside looking in, it's irresistible even if you don't feel hungry: a tableau of diners and servers, of white tablecloths and glistening tableware, framed by a gorgeous floor-to-ceiling window that forms its entire front wall. And while its ambitions stretch beyond Montclair -- the name, after all, is Latin for ''world'' -- it's best approached as a bistro, a hearth, the kind of restaurant every neighborhood should have.
2001-02-04	Easy on the Eyes and Fresh on the Palate	JUDGING by the packed houses on our visits to Esteva, the handsome new cafe facing Guilford's expansive green, the town has been waiting for such a place, one that is both good-looking and capable of serving fresh, inventive food at reasonable prices. Esteva, whose name is derived from that of the owner, Steve Wilkinson, and his wife, Eva, has transformed space formerly occupied by Bistro on the Green into a stylish cafe that is light, airy and extremely welcoming. Mr. Wilkinson, chef-owner of Steve's Centerook Cafe in Centerbrook, has been a pioneer for over 20 years in Connecticut's gustatory awakening, so there is no question about Esteva's possibilities, many of which are already evident.
2001-01-31	$25 AND UNDER; Don't Be Fooled by the Plain Wrapper	IT would be hard to imagine a plainer name for a restaurant than Irving on Irving. In fact, flash is the last thing you'll find at this little corner restaurant. Its owner also owns the Inn at Irving Place, a small and luxurious hotel next door, as well as Lady Mendl's Tea Parlor, two places that stress their grown-up appeal rather than pander to the fake-martini and pounding-bass crowd. In this company, Irving on Irving is like a cautious teenager whose idea of rebellion is to wear sneakers to school with his khakis. By day, Irving offers counter service for breakfast and lunch, mostly pastries, soups, salads and sandwiches. The dining room, which seats about 30, is calm at lunch, despite hard surfaces that amplify every sound. Tuscan bean soup ($3 small) was richly satisfying, hearty with bits of sausage. Appealing salads like Asian coleslaw and nutty wild rice with cranberries and almonds are reasonably priced at $6 for samples of three.
2001-01-21	Italian Flair In the East Village	BAR VELOCE + (212) 260-3200; 175 Second Avenue, near East 11th Street; $$; smoking permitted; all major credit cards. Halogen lights and the requisite hanging sausages are all encased in metal mesh over the glossy wood bar at this sleek metallic storefront. The menu includes supplements like a salad and cheese platter, but the focus is strictly on sandwiches and wine. Sandwiches include bresaola with arugula, grana and fresh lemon; eggplant with cured anchovies, tomato and mint pesto; prosciutto with mushrooms, truffle oil and fontina; and mortadella with red peppers, red onion and aged provolone. ($25 and Under: 1/3/01)
2001-01-17	$25 AND UNDER; Cast Away in a Sea of Dumplings in Deepest Midtown	I HAVE always loved restaurants with a specialty, and Mandoo Bar, a bright little Korean place, leaves no doubt about its signature dish. As you enter past a glass-enclosed kitchen, you can see the chefs rolling and cutting dough, stuffing and folding it into little flower-shape or half-moon dumplings until trays are full and they are ready to be cooked. The dumplings are dropped briefly into boiling water or arranged in bamboo steamers before waiters serve them. Of course, if you already know that mandoo (pronounced MAHN-do) is the Korean word for dumplings, then you have deduced the specialty of Mandoo Bar. By 1 p.m. on any weekday, Mandoo is packed, mostly with young people who work in Koreatown or in the garment district and are attracted to the spare, handsome dining room, with blond wood tables, which have cushioned benches rather than chairs. One wall is lined with boxy alcoves, each illuminated by a hidden light so that the alcoves look like frames with bright, empty spaces within.
2001-01-14	Indian and More In Jackson Heights	18 DE JULIO + (718) 429-5495; 77-05 37th Avenue; $; no smoking; Visa and MasterCard. If you are hungry for beef and plenty of it, you may be looking for a place like this Uruguayan grill. Named for the date that Uruguay celebrates its constitution, this spot serves a particularly good skirt steak. Other entrees are shell steak, filet mignon, a combination platter of short ribs, sweet sausage, savory blood sausages and chewy sweetbreads and veal stuffed with hard-boiled eggs. Each entree is served with a choice of rice, french fries or salad. ($25 and Under: 2/28/97)
2001-01-10	$25 AND UNDER; From South of the Border, Down Subtlety Way	THE prevailing image of Mexican cooking in New York is hard to shake: heavy, fatty dishes laden with thick layers of cheese and swimming in refried beans. But in the last few years a fleet of new Mexican restaurants has sailed in, bringing a lighter, subtler cuisine that is showing off the regional glories of Mexico rather than the familiar one-dimensional margarita-fueled Tex-Mex dishes. La Palapa, a bright and cheerful restaurant in the East Village, is the latest to present this alternative view. The owners, Barbara Sibley, who grew up in Mexico City, and Margaritte Malfy, who has traveled extensively in Mexico, share kitchen duties and are devoted to the cooking of Diana Kennedy, the Mexican food authority, who is a family friend of Ms. Sibley's.
2000-12-31	Western Food, With a Twist, in Darien	CHEYENNE, a new restaurant on the Post Road in Darien, has settled into quarters formerly occupied by Moody's Bar & Grill. The changes in appearance in the two roadhouse-style dining rooms seem minimal, a cactus design here and there, befitting the western name, but the menu is a real surprise, and a pleasant one at that. The name implies a western motif and indeed many dishes might be at home along the Santa Fe Trail, but there is a more of a twist to the food than the name Cheyenne suggests.
2000-12-17	Eclectic Menu in Inconspicuous Storefront	SAGE, a new restaurant in Fairfield, subtitles itself ''a gourmet restaurant.'' While that may seem a tad presumptuous for a modest place installed in an off-the-beaten-track storefront, it does telegraph the ambitions of Patrick Sinchak, the proprietor. These and his skills are considerable, as the short, eclectic menu nimbly demonstrates. Many familiar-sounding dishes are made with unexpected ingredients, giving a surprising twist of originality and pizazz to old standbys.
2000-12-15	A Hero of the Celtic Renaissance	From the cottage I keep in West Clare, I sometimes look across the Shannon Estuary to the Kerry Hills. From the end of the peninsula, I can make out Ballybunion, where Bill Clinton golfed in September 1998, in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky imbroglio. Back in Washington, Senator Joseph Lieberman was calling Mr. Clinton's behavior ''immoral,'' which, of course, it was. But in Ireland a beauty parlor named Monica's on the road to the famous golf course had its sign removed lest it embarrass the motorcadians. The Irish know what's in a name. They also know that words can hurt or heal old wounds. Is it Derry, then? Or Londonderry? Is it the North of Ireland or Northern Ireland? Is it Sean or Sidney? Mabel or Maeve? Are the violently conflicting views of the Six Counties of the North rooted in race or sect, language or doctrine, poverty or pride or power lust? ''Whatever you say,'' wrote Seamus Heaney famously of the painful case of Ulster, ''say nothing.''
2000-12-10	A Restaurant Francais as It's Meant to Be	ANOTHER very good restaurant has opened in what has turned out to be a banner year for dining out. Tartine in Westport is memorable both for its superb French food and reasonable prices for the value received (a rarity these days, especially in a restaurant francais). The tiny dining room itself is charming: cozy, unassuming, prettily decorated. There are no pyrotechnics at Tartine in looks or menu, just (just!) expertly cooked and carefully served French specialties.
2000-12-10	A Lively Scene In Williamsburg	BAHIA + (718) 218-9592; 690 Grand Street, between Manhattan and Graham Avenues; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards. Bahia, a bright, airy place that opened in June, offers an extensive menu, but the specialties are typical Salvadoran dishes. Main dishes include chicken tamales with shredded chicken, green olives and fat kernels of corn; sopa de res, a beef broth containing a huge piece of beef on the bone along with green beans, potatoes, onions and cross sections of corn on the cob; and fried or boiled yuca with fried pork, topped with marinated red onion and drizzled with tangy lime juice. ($25 and Under: 11/8/00)
2000-11-26	Singing for Your Supper	A LINE at the bottom of 28 Oak Street's elegant, understated menu reads, ''Inspiration . . . move me brightly.'' It turns out to be the opening of a Grateful Dead song, ''Terrapin Station,'' whose second line is ''Like a song with scents and colors.'' The lyrics are apt. Lee Ganbarg, the chef and owner of this year-old restaurant at center stage of downtown Ridgewood's vital, crowded dining scene, is one of a large class of young, talented New Jersey chefs who specialize in vivid presentations, gutsy, straightforward flavors and unexpected combinations of fresh, mainly American ingredients.
2000-11-26	Allowing the Math-Challenged To Savor the Coffee at Tip Time	Think fast. What's 17 percent of $45.87? How about 20 percent of $54.71?
2000-11-22	$25 AND UNDER; Through a Labyrinth to a Japanese Cook-It-Yourself	EVERY once in a while something on a restaurant menu will jump out. Like the appetizer called ''salted squid guts'' at Yakiniku JuJu, a small and friendly restaurant that specializes in cook-it-yourself shabu-shabu, sukiyaki and Japanese barbecue. Who could resist salted squid guts? Not me, and over the waiter's gentle warning that I might find them too salty, I placed an order. It felt like part of the adventure of JuJu, which seemed to offer passage into another world. To get in, you descend steps to a subterranean doorway. Then you pass through a low, narrow hallway, up a spiral staircase and, finally, into a small dining room of booths, each outfitted with a gas-powered grill (and a fire extinguisher). It is a tableau that cries out for salted squid guts.
2000-11-19	New Directions In Brooklyn	AL DI LA + (718) 783-4565 (or 4555); 248 Fifth Avenue, at Carroll Street, Park Slope; $$; no smoking; Visa and MasterCard. This homey Venetian-accented spot serves soulful and gutsy food. Starters include steamed Prince Edward Island mussels; baccala mantecato with grilled polenta; and prosciutto di San Daniele. Entrees include whole fish baked in a salt crust; braised rabbit with black olives and polenta; hanger steak tagliata with arugula; and calf liver alla Veneziana. ($25 and Under: 1/20/99)
2000-11-12	Worth a Detour In the Bronx	AMICI'S RESTAURANT ++ (718) 584-6167; 566 East 187th Street, at Hoffman Street; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards. More elegant than most of its neighboring restaurants in the Belmont section, Amici's has a large menu of traditional southern Italian dishes. Current appetizers include scungilli and calamari salad; salami and provolone; and grilled portobello mushrooms. Entrees include veal scaloppine covered with a slice of eggplant and mozzarella, sauteed in olive oil, white wine and a touch of tomato sauce; boneless breast of chicken stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella; and shrimp sauteed with olive oil, fresh basil and white wine, served in a fresh plum tomato sauce. (Article: 11/29/98)
2000-11-08	$25 AND UNDER; Salvadoran Cooking Celebrates Corn in All Its Guises	FOR centuries, corn stood at the center of the Central American universe, providing not only food but a symbol with a wealth of religious meanings. Today, corn may no longer serve the spiritual role it once did, but it is still the keystone of the Central American culinary universe, as is clear if you visit a Salvadoran restaurant like Bahia in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Bahia, a bright and airy place, opened in June. Its owners are Luis, Carlos and Jose Palomo, and Orlando Martinez, four brothers who grew up in El Salvador but have worked in Italian restaurants in Manhattan. At Bahia (the name means bay in Spanish), they offer an extensive menu that includes hamburgers, Caesar salad, Buffalo chicken wings and spaghetti puttanesca. But the specialties are typical Salvadoran dishes like pupusas, the corn pancakes that are to El Salvador what tortillas are to Mexico and arepas are to Colombia and Venezuela.
2000-11-05	A Bistro With Creative and Affordable Food	WHAT a pleasure to discover Metro Bis (for bistro) in Simsbury, a small restaurant with the charm and urbanity of a French bistro, stylish American food, and prices that are surprisingly affordable. We say surprisingly because so many of the so-called bistros that have opened in recent years have priced themselves in the haute cuisine category.
2000-11-01	Holiday Gifts, Par Avion	EVERY year, when I test the waters of mail-order gifts, I cast a wide net in the hope of finding some treasures. And every year, there are things I would love to have someone send me. Some years there are things so wonderful that I will be sending them to myself. This turned out to be one of those years.
2000-10-29	Offbeat Touches for a Melting-Pot Menu	AFTER little more than a year, White Oak Bistro in New Canaan is gone. In its place, in the former Veterans Hall with stately front columns, is 62 Main. It retains much of the decor, but differs in name, menu and front-of-house staff. Chef Robert Troilo was formerly at Habana in South Norwalk. We like the fact that the small, mostly American menu is interlaced with Asian ingredients. The restaurant's subtitle is ''eclectic American cuisine,'' and indeed it is, in a positive sense.
2000-10-29	The Phantom Typist Revealed	BLAME the twins. Or give them credit. For 15 years, Debbie Ardino was employed by Con Ed, as an executive secretary to two vice presidents among other positions.
2000-10-22	Next Hurdle: The 'Credit Divide'	FACING the television cameras, Jack Kemp, the former vice presidential candidate, sat proudly beside Jimmy Carter and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, ready to hail the 100,000th home built by Habitat for Humanity. It was a serene and dignified occasion, until Mr. Kemp's cell phone suddenly rang. ''Jack, I know you can't talk right now, but you've got to listen to me,'' an excited voice said. Wesley Buford, chairman and chief executive of Freedom Card in Los Angeles, who had glimpsed Mr. Kemp on TV, jumped at the chance to turn his speech into a marketing moment. ''Tell them they qualify for a Freedom Card,'' Mr. Buford said.
2000-10-22	A Little Havana	IT was a spring evening in 1994, and Martino Linares was lost. His mood was dark. He had just lost his job as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Warren. Driving home to Dover, he somehow detoured onto Main Street in this well-worn town. He saw a man standing at a corner and stopped to ask directions. A lifetime of wandering had led him to this spot. Born in Cuba, he emigrated to Miami as a young man in 1950, volunteered in the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, was captured and spent three years in a Cuban prison, returned to the United States, cooked in French and Italian and kosher restaurants along the Eastern Seaboard, and finally found himself, jobless, on this desolate corner.
2000-10-20	Taking Aim at Tax Havens, I.R.S. Seeks Credit Card Slips	The Internal Revenue Service, struggling against Caribbean havens it suspects of draining away at least $70 billion a year in personal income tax revenue, has set its sights on a new target -- the credit card slips of suspected tax evaders. The agency has asked a federal judge in Miami to issue summonses for two years' worth of records of MasterCard and American Express card transactions in the United States that were billed to bank accounts in Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands.
2000-10-20	BUSINESS DIGEST	United Technologies Seen In Deal to Buy Honeywell United Technologies, which makes everything from jet engines to elevators, is expected to acquire Honeywell International, the diversified manufacturer that merged with Allied Signal last year, for $40.3 billion in stock, executives close to the negotiations said.

2000-10-11	$25 AND UNDER; A Park Slope Spot Travels Far and Wide to Please	AS far as restaurants go, Park Slope has been an easy target for derision, the Upper West Side of Brooklyn, to cite another deprived area. But now, things are looking up. Rose Water, a petite restaurant just off Sixth Avenue, has provided a jolt of excitement to its residential neighborhood since opening about a month ago. Its innovative cooking, moderate prices and relaxed ambience would be exciting anywhere.
2000-10-08	Peaks and Valleys	GOING to the mountains to view the changing leaves has always had an extraordinary effect on me: it makes me hungry. So I've learned to build a little advance planning into October excursions to the state's northwestern reaches -- where, I'm told, we're about to experience one of the most glorious seasons ever, thanks to the cool, rainy summer. Sure, fall foliage is great. But when you've seen enough, when darkness descends and the moon rises over the rim of the mountains and the air is flinty with cold and pungent with wood smoke . . . by now your stomach is calling, ''Where do we eat already?''
2000-10-01	Southern Exposure	WHILE Edison has many restaurants featuring the wheat-based fare of North India -- puffy naan bread served with tandoori chicken -- few offer the rice-based vegetarian cuisine of the Spice Coast in South India, a place where steaming idlis, crunchy dosas and pillowy uttappam reign. Murali Iyengar, co-owner of Swagath Gourmet, knew that along with immigrants from the north, the town was also filled with South Indian Brahmins, whose customs include special foods. Food was a natural choice for Mr. Iyengar, also a Brahmin and a man who had spent his youth cooking for his 11 brothers and sisters in his homeland.
2000-09-29	Eating Out	Food That Travels Well Delicious, nutritious and portable, sandwiches are the perfect meal for people on the go. These dozen places offer great sandwiches.

2000-09-24	Legacy of an Antitrust Chief	When Joel Klein steps down from the Justice Department this week, he will leave enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws in better shape than when he took over the antitrust division in 1996. He will, of course, be remembered most for taking on Microsoft. But beyond that celebrated case, Mr. Klein brought new energy and credibility to a division whose enforcement arm had lain dormant since the Reagan administration. Mr. Klein's tenure did not start well. As acting head of the antitrust division, he approved unconditionally the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, eliminating the benefits that would come from future competition between these regional phone giants. But Mr. Klein made sound judgments in subsequent cases, showing that mainstream antitrust principles can be effectively applied to modern markets.
2000-09-24	Italian Cuisine in New Millwood Setting	PATRONS of the old Spaccarelli's, a shabby place in the A.&P. shopping strip here, have probably seen its brand new structure just around the corner. The restaurant has been reinvented as a contemporary spot, with gauzy curtains covering a sweep of glass on one wall and a honeycomb stacked with wine bottles on another. Subtle lighting and dusty rose walls make the room glow. Although still a neighborhood eatery, it's not the Spaccarelli's we remember, and hooray for that.
2000-09-24	If It's Off to Cheshire, Take a Hearty Appetite	BRIX in Cheshire inhabits the space (with the same ownership and chef) that once housed the Pavilion, but the proprietors Onella and Bernard Gayraud (he is also the chef) have changed the cuisine, menu and decor dramatically, evoking a more casual Mediterranean image, which seems to have taken hold very nicely. With good reason. The bright, stylishly mustard walls, parquet floor, Windsor-style chairs, banquettes and booths are a simple backdrop for some delicious, fresh-tasting food on a menu that also features a few pastas and pizzas. We were optimistic from the moment the aromatic Liuzzi Italian extra-virgin olive oil was poured in individual saucers, served along with a basket of wholesome whole wheat bread.
2000-09-17	Everyday Plastic, Spun Into Gold	IT wasn't too long ago that credit cards were reserved primarily for major purchases like furniture, appliances or fine jewelry. But these days, many a consumer routinely pulls out plastic for a cup of coffee, a movie ticket or even a cab ride. More people are using credit cards instead of cash or bank checks, and more card issuers are encouraging that behavior, offering reward points to customers for each dollar charged. Depending on the program, those points can be traded for airline tickets, hotel accommodations, gift certificates or even a Mario Lemieux hockey stick. Last year, nearly 17 percent of all consumer purchases were made with credit cards, according to Credit Card News, which tracks the industry, compared with 10 percent in 1993.
2000-09-14	Undercover Buying, Fake Names and All	THERE are a lot of things I do on Amazon.com that I don't necessarily want everyone to know about. The day I compared prices on home pregnancy tests comes to mind. So does the time that I placed a Bruce Springsteen CD in my shopping cart, then removed it after being teased by my husband (who refers to the aging Mr. Springsteen as ''the Wayne Newton of our generation''). I am embarrassed about the hours I waste checking the sales ranks of books I have written.
2000-09-07	Citigroup to Buy Associates First for $31 Billion	Continuing its campaign to become the dominant financial services provider around the globe, Citigroup said yesterday that it would buy the Associates First Capital Corporation, the biggest American consumer finance company, for about $31.1 billion in stock. The acquisition, the biggest since the formation of Citigroup in 1998, would give Citigroup a significant position in consumer lending in Japan and a few other countries. It also would improve Citigroup's standing in the credit card and commercial leasing businesses.
2000-09-03	From a Cold Spring Patio, a Hudson View	SEEING the widening Hudson River Valley through the rain and mists that have plagued our summer has not detracted from its loveliness. As Monet understood and depicted in his many paintings of Rouen's cathedral, every moment and every weather can bring a stirring new impression. And where better to take in this view than from the very edge of the river -- from the lawn or patio of North Gate here, or through the broad windows of its dining room? Given such a setting, any restaurant need only be adequate, and North Gate's kitchen has had a checkered past. But recent visits have found the food inventive and delightfully appealing, and the service to be charming and accommodating.
2000-09-03	Lots of Style, Carefully Prepared Dishes	INFERNO in Westport is kin to the restaurant of the same name in Greenwich, but not an identical twin in decor or food. In limited space, Inferno has created a sense of edginess, with paprika- and avocado-painted walls, a water wall that picks up the metallic glints of a copper-faced oven and chimney in the open kitchen, high ceiling, silvery tables and a concrete floor. Inferno's menu is also relatively spare, emphasizing pastas and pizzas, with just a few appetizer and entree specials. Certain dishes were very good indeed.
2000-09-03	Personal Business; How Debit Cards Can Burn Holes in Student Pockets	TO avoid sending their children off to college with a financial time bomb -- a credit card -- in their pockets, many parents have begun telling them to carry a debit card instead. But though its pitfalls are not as well known, this substitute can be just as dangerous to a student's finances and credit rating. Personal cash flow has always been tricky ground for college students, who tend to plunge into their first experiences of living on their own with little money and less skill at managing it. And parents have long sought ways to help keep their young scholars from being caught short without accelerating them down the road to profligacy and debt trouble.
2000-08-30	MasterCard is shifting its efforts to market to Hispanics to a new level and another language.	HOW do you reach people in the fastest-growing segment of the American population? Simple.

2000-08-27	South(ern) Orange	BEFORE she opened Niecy's, Denise Hampton says, she sat outside the storefront for two days and counted the people going by on Valley Street. It didn't take her long to conclude that the area could support the restaurant she had in mind, a place that would serve the kind of food she remembered from girlhood in Little Rock, Ark. It was a shrewd bet. In the two years since Niecy's opened, just about everything has gone right for downtown South Orange, and Niecy's is one of those things.
2000-08-27	Lire and Francs Via the Web	CASH may be making a comeback. Two major companies say they have a brisk business delivering bundles of foreign currency to people who are preparing to travel overseas. In a study last year American Express discovered that people on the road in the United States carry an average of $500. Fat rolls of cash -- how quaint. Oanda, a company with a Web site that specializes in currency transactions and international currency quotations, linked up with Thomas Cook Global and Financial Services this month to offer overnight or second-day delivery of 100 foreign currencies, or Thomas Cook traveler's checks in six foreign denominations, on the basis of orders placed through www.oanda.com. Deliveries are made on business days.

2000-08-23	Testimony Ends in U.S. Case Against Credit Card Giants	The two-month trial of the government's landmark antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard limped to the finish line yesterday with both sides expressing satisfaction with their arguments and independent observers reluctant to predict the outcome. With the end of testimony and evidence, the heavily lobbied case headed toward the day, slated for late October, when it will go to United States Judge Barbara S. Jones for a decision. That could lead to a restructuring of the giant, highly profitable industry or, at the other extreme, to what in effect would be a ratification of current practice.
2000-08-13	Up-Island	AS you head north on Long Beach Boulevard, the four- and five-lane 1960's-style drag strip that forms the spine of Long Beach Island, the land suddenly seems to broaden at the end of Surf City. This is a pleasing illusion: the island actually narrows at this point. But Surf City marks the end of one Long Beach Island and the beginning of another -- the boundary between what you might call the township of T-ShirtBagelPizzaRealtyIceCream MiniatureGolf and the more relaxed, spread-out, genteel and (why beat around the bush?) moneyed upper island.
2000-08-13	August 6-12; Greens Joke and Reformers Fight	It is easily the wittiest candidate commercial of the 2000 election. In a parody of MasterCard's ''priceless'' television campaign, Ralph Nader's first spot takes aim at the ways the major-party candidates finance their runs for the presidency. ''Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000 a plate,'' the announcer says. ''Campaign ads filled with half-truths: $10 million dollars. Promises to special interest groups: over $10 billion dollars. Finding out the truth: priceless.''
2000-08-06	Once a Chef, Now With His Own Place	IT'S the American dream. Riccardo Traslavina fled Pinochet's Chile with the help of Amnesty International when he was 17. He landed in New York City and later went to the East End to labor in the kitchens of the restaurants there. With hard work and a lot of talent, he attained the position of sous chef at Nick & Toni's in East Hampton and was picked to be the chef of their Honest Diner. He went on to be executive chef at 95 School Street in Bridgehampton and the Laundry in East Hampton. This summer he achieved the ultimate: a place of his own. At Riccardo's Seafood House, on Three Mile Harbor in East Hampton, he is turning out the kind of Hamptons' fare that made him popular, in addition to preparing a number of dishes from his native Chile and other Latin American countries.
2000-07-30	The Old Recipe	CLAUDE BAILLS learned his trade in his native southern France and spent years cooking in world-class French kitchens. But his bistro here is a sort of homecoming for him. Mr. Baills (the name rhymes with fries) started out at 13, scrubbing pots and peeling vegetables in the sweaty kitchen of a Moroccan-owned restaurant in St.-Tropez. After a hitch in the French Army, he graduated to a luxury liner, the France, then found himself in Manhattan, working for the great chef Andre Soltner in the pioneering early years of Lutece.
2000-07-19	An Aw-Shucks Facade, and Food With Style	BY the time I made my final visit to the Grocery, I was used to the ritual. At some point in the meal, I knew, Charles Kiely, one of the two chefs, would approach the table and stand silently, with drooping shoulders and a depressed expression, like a young Tim Conway. Bad news was coming. ''We overcooked the duck,'' he said one evening. Sigh. The visit before, it had been a scallop special that arrived several scallops short, but with an unadvertised halibut fillet. ''I guess I got caught,'' Mr. Kiely said mournfully. ''Eleven people ordered the special and we ran out, so I tried to come up with something else.''
2000-07-16	A Great Escape	THE CAFE AT ROSEMONT is the sort of place you talk about reluctantly -- a secret you want to keep. It inhabits one of those corners of New Jersey that are vanishing as fast as developers can crack the zoning codes, a place of barns and cornfields and gentle hills, of two-lane roads where you half-expect to see Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn coming over the next rise in a Packard convertible. In fact, they might have parked that convertible in the gravel lot behind the Cafe, a sprawling Civil War-era general store that looks more or less as it did in an 1886 photograph hanging in the rear lobby. And while they are a little too formally dressed -- Grant in his tweeds, Hepburn in a flowing summer frock -- they look right at home at their antique wooden table beside a window, the setting sun glinting off the silverware.
2000-07-14	Yellow Cabs Start to Take Credit Cards	In the age of e-commerce and ubiquitous credit, many New Yorkers have found that they can carry on their daily activities without forking over a single greenback. Soon, cash transactions could become optional at one of their few remaining strongholds: yellow cabs. Officials of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission said yesterday that 50 yellow cabs had been cruising the city for the last three weeks with devices that allow riders to pay their fares with credit cards.
2000-07-11	ASSOCIATES FIRST CAPITAL TO BUY ZALE'S CREDIT BUSINESS	The Associates First Capital Corporation, the second-largest United States finance company, agreed yesterday to buy a $630 million credit card portfolio from the Zale Corporation jewelry chain. Associates, based in Irving, Tex., which issues Visa and MasterCard credit cards, will get 840,000 Zale credit card accounts and run Zale operations in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Arizona. Associates already issues cards for retailers like the RadioShack Corporation and Staples Inc.. Associates is also the largest United States issuer of gas station credit cards. Associates First's shares fell $1.0625, to $22.25, in New York trading. Zale shares were unchanged at $40.75.
2000-07-11	MasterCard Starts Online-Service Ads	MasterCard International will promote for the first time its new so-called electronic wallet service in a commercial scheduled to begin running tonight on NBC during the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The spot, created by the New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, brings to life the idea of shopping online as a man fills a real basket with merchandise in the same way an Internet shopper fills a virtual basket.
2000-07-02	Personal Business; New Questions About Block's Lucrative Tax Loans	THE carefully constructed image of H & R Block as America's trusted tax preparer was marred a decade ago, when consumer advocates accused the company of marketing advances on customers' tax refunds at usurious interest rates. Critics said flat fees for the two-week loans disguised annual rates as high as 250 percent. Plaintiffs' lawyers filed a host of class action lawsuits.
2000-07-02	In Mount Kisco, a Place for Seafood	IN the sweet languor of these long days, if summer vacation is still weeks away, an evening feasting on lobster, steamers or fish and chips at the Fish Cellar can produce the illusion of having a picnic or dining at the shore now. Weather permitting, a seat at a table on the back patio will heighten that fantasy. The work in the kitchen could use more supervision. Occasionally, salads were swamped in the creamy dressing of the house, seasoning was absent or excessive and timing was off. But the sublime freshness and clean flavor of the fish was constant. It would be hard to find better.
2000-07-02	Southwest of the Border	PREGUNTE por los especiales,'' says the menu at Charrito's: Ask for the specials. It's good advice, but you may need to do more than ask. One recent Thursday evening, the waiter -- a tall, polite young man of seemingly infinite patience -- assured me that there were no specials that night. I persisted. He shook his head. My voice rose. Finally, perhaps suspecting that I might be dangerous, he humored me by bringing a plate of enchiladas in mole sauce, a specialty of the southwestern Mexican state of Oaxaca.
2000-06-22	MasterCard and Visa	To the Editor: Every financial institution should be able to offer consumers a wide range of choices. Practices that keep competitors out run counter to what the law promised. One such practice -- a Visa and MasterCard bylaw that prohibits member banks in the United States from issuing competing cards -- is at the heart of the Justice Department's lawsuit against those associations (editorial, June 15).
2000-06-16	A Look in Capitol Wallets, Fat and Slim	Personal wealth and power do not necessarily correspond on Capitol Hill, with some of the leading members of Congress holding few assets and avoiding the booming stock market. Others, however, took the plunge.
2000-06-15	The Next Big Antitrust Case	This week the Justice Department began its antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard. The government argues that the Visa and MasterCard networks are too cozy with each other and use their enormous financial power to knock out potential competitors, thereby stunting innovation. Some of the arguments mirror those that Justice made against Microsoft. Consumers should hope for the same outcome -- a resounding victory for Justice. Thousands of banks offer Visa and MasterCard credit cards. Many banks offer both. The trouble comes from the fact that some banks that serve on the governing board of one network do substantial business with the other. This ''dual governance,'' says Justice, discourages competition between the networks, stifling the desire to create new products. It is important to note what this case is not about. The individual banks set interest rates and frequent-flier and other benefits in order to compete for cardholders. Justice does not argue that the banks are conspiring to deny customers good deals. Instead, it makes two other antitrust accusations.
2000-06-15	Anonymous Shopping At Stores on the Web	People concerned about privacy can anonymously send e-mail and surf the Web. But shop online anonymously? That has been nearly impossible, since most Web sites require the buyer's credit card number. One proposed solution is to provide shoppers with an anonymous debit account that can be used on any e-commerce site that takes credit cards. This is the approach taken by a new service called PrivateBuy.
2000-06-14	Ignoring Exhibit A: The Mailbox	These days, credit cards come in flavors to appeal to every taste. Anybody with a decent credit record receives an offer (or six) each month for yet another card. So, whatever you think of the credit card economy, it's hard to deny that the competition is hot and heavy. Why, then, is the Justice Department bringing antitrust charges against Visa and MasterCard, the two associations whose 6,000 members issue credit cards? The Justice Department has two problems. First, it claims that the associations, which develop technology, standardize transaction procedures and market the brands on behalf of their members, are too intertwined. Banks can sit on the governing board of one association even as it issues the cards of the other. Worse, Justice claims, are rules that inhibit competition by forbidding members from issuing cards from rivals like American Express and Discover.
2000-06-13	Antitrust Trial Begins For Visa and MasterCard	Government antitrust officials began efforts yesterday to prove in court that Visa and MasterCard, the world's two biggest credit card networks, limit competition with each other and their rivals to the detriment of consumers. The outcome of the case could force changes in the structures of Visa and MasterCard, which together control about 75 percent of the $1.3 trillion market, and transform how competitors like the American Express Company operate.
2000-06-13	BUSINESS DIGEST	H.M.O.'s Ruled Not Liable In U.S. Court for Some Suits The Supreme Court spared managed health care from a potentially fatal legal attack, ruling unanimously that the financial incentives that health maintenance organizations give doctors to hold down costs do not make the H.M.O.'s liable to suits in federal court for violating a duty to put their patients first. The decision leaves such lawsuits in the province of state courts, while at the same time handing back to Congress the issue of patients' rights as a matter of federal policy. The ruling was not likely to be the court's last word, with questions not presented in the case remaining to be resolved. [Page A1.]

2000-06-11	Artists Pro and Con With a New Generation of Swindles	WITH crime down, the streets of New York are safer than they have been in years. And to the casual eye, it may seem as if the city's fraud artists, who traditionally choose the warmer months in which to ply their trade, have all but disappeared from the streets. The Giuliani administration's crackdown on low-level quality of life offenders seems to have had a chilling effect on the more traditional street swindlers. Although they still exist, their numbers have decreased substantially, especially in Midtown.
2000-06-04	East, Meet West	CONTRARY to what you might think, the name of this restaurant has nothing to do with Montclair's best-known citizen, Yogi Berra, who is famously (and probably erroneously) supposed to have said, ''It's deja vu all over again.'' Manop Sutipayakul, who is both co-chef and co-owner, says modestly that the name was meant to suggest that diners might want to return again and again. I think he's on to something, because there is plenty to come back for. You will find amazing things on the menu of this 15-month-old French-Thai ''fusion'' restaurant on the main drag of downtown Montclair. Green papaya keeping company with roasted garlic and anchovy-chili paste. A whole grilled fish on a banana leaf. Lime leaves. Lemongrass. One recent Monday night, wild boar wandered in from D'Artagnan, the Newark game purveyor, and found itself sharing a plate with a cornucopia of vegetables -- black beans, red pepper, zucchini, little Thai eggplant -- in a chili-infused sauce that could make a pig dance.
2000-05-31	$25 AND UNDER; A New Orleans Spot Worthy of a Great Tradition	ON a visit to New Orleans last year, a friend who has lived there most of his life took me to a highly touted new restaurant that left us both disappointed. Among the pallid, tasteless culprits was a punchless turtle soup that struck him as an embarrassment to the region's vaunted culinary order. ''I can't allow you to go home with that taste in your mouth,'' he said, his New Orleans pride pierced, and dragged me off to Commander's Palace, where the turtle soup was so good it inspired us to sit through an entire second dinner.
2000-05-28	Menu From Yesteryear, River Traffic Views	THE River Grille and Bar in Westport, which recently changed its name from The Mooring, doesn't seem like it's in a time warp, until you start reading the menu. In looks alone, it has the simplicity of a waterside restaurant (which is what it is), its wall of windows facing a small marina on the Saugatuck River. The menu, however, gives the impression that the restaurant revolution has not yet occurred. There are so many old-timers -- shrimp cocktail, clams casino, stuffed clams, and main courses of fried seafood: shrimp, sea scallops, clam strips, fish and chips. In fact, the menu was more ambitious, less basic, when we first visited (in 1978) than it is now.
2000-05-28	Spicing Up First Avenue	GALATA TURKISH KABAB HOUSE ++ (212) 452-2752; 1586 First Avenue, between 82nd and 83rd Streets; $; smoking permitted; Visa and MasterCard. This narrow, plain restaurant used to be Agora, where the Mediterranean menu had a pronounced Turkish influence. Now, new owners have renamed it, and the emphasis on Turkish food is even stronger. Cold appetizers include red kidney beans cooked in tomato, potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic in olive oil; grape leaves stuffed with rice, pine nuts, raisins, onions and currants; and smoked puree eggplant, sesame oil, lemon juice and a hint of garlic. Main courses include small chunks of baby lamb marinated with seasonings, charcoal-broiled; chunks of baby eggplant with ground leg of lamb, seasoned with fresh herbs; and Turkish meatballs with cubes of lightly fried pita bread and tomato sauce topped with yogurt.

The companies now await a decision by the Federal Communications Commission, which is considering requests by competitors and consumer groups to force the sale of more assets. [Page A1.]
2000-05-26	Credit Cards Duel Before Senate Panel	Judging by the nearly four billion solicitations that flooded American mailboxes last year, the credit card business would seem to be one of the most viciously competitive. In how many industries does one business disparage another by name in national television advertisements, as Visa has done with its long-running ''they don't take American Express'' campaign? Even so, the federal government strenuously disagrees that consumers have as much choice as they need: 19 months ago the Justice Department sued MasterCard and Visa, accusing them of violating antitrust laws. In recent weeks, debate over this issue has sharply intensified as the suit approaches trial.
2000-05-24	$25 AND UNDER; A New Greenwich Village Bistro Happy to Be a Bistro	IN 1993, when most people wouldn't have known a dot-com from kingdom come, David and Carol Cesaro opened their little French bistro, L'Ardoise. The world, or at least a small part of it, has changed since then. Scads of restaurants have opened and flamed out, fortunes have been made and squandered, and still L'Ardoise has plugged away on its rather unfashionable block of First Avenue on the Upper East Side. Now, almost seven years later, the Cesaros have with little fanfare opened their second restaurant, Panache, in Greenwich Village. It is named after a French summer cocktail that is two-thirds beer, one-third lemonade. Panache, in the style of L'Ardoise, is an unpretentious place, with a wood floor, leather banquettes and brass lighting fixtures. With little flash, the food is the thing at Panache, and the chef, Thierry Andry, formerly of Le Gans, has put together a menu that is generally down to earth and well-anchored in bistro traditions.
2000-05-21	Star Spelled Backward	APPROACHING Rat's for the first time, you might think you'd wandered into one of those senseless, antic dreams from which you wake up giggling. The road from Interstate 295, which seems headed for nothing more enticing than a wasteland of industrial parks on the bedraggled outskirts of Trenton, turns out to be lined with larger-than-life contemporary sculptures, including a superrealistic molar as big as a bungalow. Just when you think you've gotten hopelessly lost amid the corporate clutter, you find yourself on an island of greenery dotted with still more sculpture, much of it lifted from French Impressionist paintings. And a sign that says, ''Welcome to Rat's.'' Where on earth are you? This is Grounds for Sculpture, a 22-acre oasis carved out of the old New Jersey State Fairgrounds by the astonishingly eccentric sculptor and pharmaceutical heir J. Seward Johnson Jr. Before we get to the restaurant, a short course in Mr. Johnson's art: serious critics have dismissed it as kitsch, and it's hard to argue with them; what else do you call a weirdly lifelike re-creation of Manet's ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe,'' lovingly rendered in hand-painted bronze? That molar is his, too, and so is the buxom, nightgown-clad lady of the house who greets restaurantgoers from a lighted second-story window, prompting double takes and guffaws.
2000-05-21	The Way We Live Now: 5-21-00: Questions for David Ruggerio; The Cook, The Thief	Q: You were arrested two years ago, when you were chef at Le Chantilly, for some rather extreme financial improprieties. Some of the stuff your restaurant was trying to get away with was so egregious that it could have been motivated only by absolute desperation. What in the world was going on there? Le Chantilly was making money, but it was laden, from a prior business partner, with huge tax debt. We were under constant threats, the I.R.S. was coming down threatening every day to padlock the place.
2000-05-19	Web Sites Offer Cheaper Gas	THE Internet has changed the ways that people order new cars and bid on old ones. Now Web entrepreneurs are out to change the way you fill your gas tank. Several Web sites are offering services aimed at trimming the cost of a fill-up -- and just in time, too, since motorists face the prospect of entering the peak summer travel season with prices 35 cents a gallon higher than they were a year ago.
2000-05-14	In New Haven, It's an Adventure in Cuisine	NEW HAVEN continues to surprise us with its varied ethnic restaurants. The latest is Lalibela, named in honor of an ancient Ethiopian king and specializing in the food of that African country. This small, attractive newcomer seems well-suited to a college town for three reasons: modest prices, vegetarian dishes and an informal style of dining. We cherished fond memories of dining Ethiopian style in Chicago and New York with sizeable groups of friends, when everyone dug in with gusto, scooping up the food with torn segments of an unusual spongy bread called injera. No forks required or provided.
2000-05-11	William Boyle, Credit Card Pioneer, Dies at 88	William J. Boyle, a Long Island banker who played a major role in devising the first bank-issued credit card -- a forerunner of Visa and Mastercard -- died on April 30. He was 88 and lived in Garden City, N.Y. Mr. Boyle developed the Franklin Charge Account Plan, which charged interest and let customers make partial payments each month, in 1951 at the Franklin National Bank in Rockville Centre, N.Y.
2000-05-07	A Good Address	ON a beautiful spring night in Montclair, it felt right choosing Twenty Eight for dinner. Ducking under the bowing, flowering pear trees, I entered the restaurant feeling confident and unencumbered, for it has a clear sense of style and ease. It allows you to relax and makes you pleased to be doing so. Twenty Eight is just that -- just right. Which is interesting. The restaurant is the brainchild of Raymond Badach, a former garment district player who inherited his Sicilian mother's love of food. Aside from the homey Raymond's cafe down the street, Mr. Badach has had no training. But he has watched the food scene for years. A native New Jerseyan, Mr. Badach is urbane and calm, apparently picking up on the New York pulse but not necessarily racing along with it. And Mr. Badach gave Montclair Twenty Eight in 1994.
2000-04-30	A Bohemian Mix In the East Village	ACQUARIO + (212) 260-4666; 5 Bleecker Street, at the Bowery; $$; smoking at the bar; cash only. This small, warm place straight out of the Village's bohemian past, has put together a menu that, with its focus on seafood and tapas dishes, seems modeled after Il Buco's (located around the block) but is less expensive. Starters at Acquario include fennel salad with Granny Smith apples, roasted white grapes and balsamic vinaigrette; mixed grilled vegetables with salmoriglio oil; and buffalo mozzarella with roasted peppers and eggplant marinade. Entrees include ravioli that are filled with goat cheese with a caponata sauce; Spanish saffron risotto cakes with wild mushrooms and ''trifolati'' sauce; Portuguese fish stew in a herb broth and garlic crostini; pappardelle with wild mushrooms, artichokes and rosemary ragout; and chicken breast sauteed with wild mushrooms and roasted radicchio.

2000-04-30	A Little Night Meal	LILAC inhabits a dollhouse of a room, just 42 seats packed into a former cigar store not many steps from downtown Millburn's best-known landmark, the Paper Mill Playhouse. Open since October, it already seems to have replaced the late 40 Main Street (now known as Cafe Main, and by some accounts less ambitious) as the destination of choice for theatergoers in search of serious food. That they will find, though it may be a tight squeeze. The owners, Carole Leone and Adrien Gresnigt (they are engaged to be married), make creative use of the space. Lilybelle, their catering and takeout shop in the adjoining storefront, turns into a coatroom and waiting area by night; the walls of the restaurant itself are adorned with trompe-l'oeil paintings meant to suggest a vast drawing room.
2000-04-30	Humble in Name, but Far-From-Humble Menu	WHILE clearly informal, Catoonah Kitchen and Bar in Ridgefield is anything but the bacon-fried eggs-hash kind of place its name unfortunately suggests. The bistro-style menu telegraphs quickly that Catoonah has ambition, with far more going on in the kitchen than one might expect.
2000-04-29	U.S. AND 17 STATES ASK JUDGE TO CUT MICROSOFT IN 2 PARTS; SERIOUS CURBS ALSO SOUGHT	Determined to change the rules of competition in the software industry, the Justice Department and 17 states asked a federal judge today to break Microsoft into two parts and seriously restrain its behavior while the breakup is being carried out. Federal and state officials, partners in the long-running antitrust case against Microsoft, said their approach was intended to encourage market forces to reshape incentives in the software industry. The two resulting companies, they said, would have strong motivations to compete with each other while also forming new alliances with other companies and products that Microsoft now shuns.
2000-04-16	Nautical Touches and Fish in Scarsdale	THERE are problems here but not in the kitchen. It prepares pristine fish in creative ways and presents it stunningly. Nor does the decor contradict the theme. References to the sea are employed with a light hand: ribbed ceiling beams, porthole sconces and a display shelf lined with oyster service plates. The house overflows on weekends, however, and the wait for a table can be 30 minutes. But more on this later.

2000-03-20	Despite up-and-down ratings, marketers still flock to the Academy Awards broadcast.	THE 72nd annual Academy Awards show is looking a lot like a Super Sunday, and not just because that's the day the ceremony is now held. The Oscar presentation on ABC has traditionally been the second biggest day of the year for advertising, trailing only the Super Bowl. This year, though, that gridiron-style hoopla and hyperbole has permeated the broadcast to the point where the network ought to bill it as ''Oscar Bowl LXXII.''
2000-03-19	Perhaps It's Time for a Romantic Evening	THE well-kept old frame house now sheltering the hot new Vivo Bar and Cafe in downtown Greenwich has seen its share of tenants through the years. But judging by Vivo's roaring start, it should inhabit the premises for a long time. The space has been modified into several cozy dining areas and the well-executed menu, the creation of a Belgian chef named Michou, almost guarantees an enchanting evening or lunch. There were auspicious signs from the beginning of our first evening when a basket arrived with several kinds of crunchy-crusted and unusual breads. Along with it came sun-dried tomato-infused olive oil and a ramekin of several types of excellent marinated olives.
2000-03-12	Clove at First Sight	WHO doesn't like garlic?'' Marc Corello said when asked about the crowd at his Garlic Rose Bistro. No one there, I hope, because the menu is practically all-garlic, from soup to ice cream. The hanging bulbs of garlic remind you where you are, not that a diner could possibly forget once the Garlic Rose bread dip arrives. Its contents are considered a secret confined to a few staff members, but basically it is chunky, green, oily and addictive, with pecorino Romano shavings, fresh herbs, olive oil and plenty of garlic. At any other restaurant you might decide this is enough garlic for one night. Here, the intense dip is a way of saying there's no turning back. In any event, this concoction appeared throughout the meal, spread on croutons and baked, mixed with lamb into bulging stuffed mushrooms, and used as a marinade for the filet mignon. You can purchase a pint of it as you pay for your meal (the check notes than you can peel garlic in lieu of payment).
2000-03-10	Hard to believe, but the direct marketer Draft Worldwide will acquire the iconoclastic AG.	IN an odd coupling that makes Felix and Oscar seem almost like clones, Draft Worldwide, a giant direct marketing agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, is joining forces with AG Worldwide, the brand strategy and advertising agency owned by the iconoclastic creative executive Peter Arnell. Draft, based in Chicago, is expected to announce formally today that it is acquiring a majority stake in AG, based in New York, for undisclosed terms. AG is known for developing and strengthening brand identities for advertisers like Banana Republic, Hanes hosiery, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Ray-Ban and Samsung. Draft handles direct and promotional marketing accounts with estimated billings of $2.7 billion for clients like American Express, Compaq, General Motors, Stamps.com and the United States Postal Service.
2000-03-08	$25 AND UNDER; Mexican-Asian Places Multiply: Now There Are Two	THE annals of fusion cuisine are not exactly bulging with examples of Mexican-Asian restaurants. I count two such places in New York City, which might actually make it the world's Mexican-Asian leader. It's hard to say why Mexico and Asia have not sparked a hotter culinary fire together. With a shared taste for ingredients like cilantro, chilies and rice, the regions have more grounds for compatibility than most. Yet only the Bright Food Shop in Chelsea, which is a decade old, and now Komodo in the East Village have seen fit to explore the possibilities.
2000-03-05	A Spot on a Park-Like Edge of the Hudson	FILLED with diners and strollers in the long warm days of summer, Harvest-on-Hudson's tended grounds at the edge of the river are deserted now. But strings of sparkling lights weave through trees and trellised walkways, lending a fairyland quality to the winter landscape. And through the dark, guests can still enjoy the running lights of otherwise invisible tankers that ply the river. Inside, the grand space is treated with broad strokes: terra cotta walls, bold ceramics and candlelight. Dishes are now prepared for individual diners, not for entire tables to share, but otherwise, the new menu and the new hand at the stove depart little from the style of its opening days. While not all stations are as careful as they might be, and occasionally salt takes over a dish, diners will find, most often, a vigilant kitchen and some delectable food. And you can't beat the surroundings.

The owners of this addition to New York's pizza pantheon are related to the owners of the Patsy's mini-chain and of Nick's Pizza in Forest Hills, Queens, and their pies meet the same high standards. Toppings include sun-dried tomatoes, onions, prosciutto and fresh roasted peppers. Pasta selections include spinach ravioli in a pink sauce topped with fresh mozzarella, and rigatoni in cream of tomato sauce with vodka and bacon. Salads selections include mesclun with a walnut balsamic vinegar olive oil dressing and walnuts; homemade mozzarella, tomatoes, roasted peppers, red onions, fresh basil and olive oil; and insalata romana topped with grilled chicken breast.

2000-02-27	Tunisia Revisited	The plane from palermo to tunis was late leaving, and we passed the time speculating about our fellow passengers: which were Sicilian, and which Tunisian (not easy to guess); which were honeymooners on their way to the new beach resorts of Djerba or Port El Kantaoui. Thirty-five years earlier my husband, Tonino, and I had spent our honeymoon in Tunisia, North Africa's smallest country, with a population of more than nine million people living in an area slightly larger than the state of Georgia. Then it had been a newly independent country poised on the edge of a tourist boom. Now we were going back to see what remained of the Tunisia we had explored and loved in 1964, and what had changed beyond all recognition. It was dark by the time the prop plane whistled and shuddered across the narrow tract of Mediterranean that separates Sicily from the northern coast of Africa -- an hour's flight -- and landed at the Tunis airport. Tunis in 1964 was a pleasant, lazy colonial city that spread out from the gates of the medina, the old walled Muslim city, along the Avenue Habib Bourghiba to the sea. Lining the street were five- and six-story white buildings with sky-blue trim in myriad variations on an amusing French-Moorish theme. The center of life was the Cafe de Paris, filled then with elegant Arab gentlemen dressed in white, white djellabas over their Bermuda shorts and knee socks, red fezzes on their heads and small nosegays of jasmine blossoms behind one ear.
2000-02-27	New College Sticker Shock: Junior's Credit Card Bill	PARENTS who thought they had planned enough, saved enough and struggled enough to see their children through college are confronting a challenge they never anticipated -- what to do when junior comes home one weekend and announces that he is deep in debt on credit cards they didn't even know he had. As credit cards have become increasingly available on campus, some students are piling up the sorts of debts that only their parents can pay. Financial experts recommend that, before their children even leave for college, parents train them in the responsible use of credit. Some universities are offering such advice, and some have banned credit card issuers from their campuses.
2000-02-24	Setback in Court for Big Credit Card Issuers	Visa USA Inc. and MasterCard International Inc., defendants in a possible $24.3 billion antitrust suit, suffered a setback yesterday when a federal judge certified the case against them as a class action. The lawsuit contends that MasterCard and Visa USA, a unit of Visa International Inc., use their monopoly power in the credit card industry to dominate the debit card industry. The suit was brought by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sears, Roebuck & Company, and 11 other large and small retailers.
2000-02-23	$25 AND UNDER; Surprise! Making a Meal of Porridge, Chinese Style	FOR more than a few years I have been a confirmed congee lover. This is something of a surprise to me, because I loathe oatmeal and other hot cereals, the stuff that supposedly puts such a warm feeling in American tummies on winter mornings. Yet, congee, also known as jook, is nothing more than Chinese hot cereal, a milky rice porridge that is a typical Chinese breakfast dish and is also eaten at other times of the day. The Chinese add all sorts of savory tidbits to congee, which is especially appealing to me. And the best congee I've had in New York is at Congee Village, a friendly restaurant on the Lower East Side, which has an outlandish interior full of bamboo and plastic hanging vines and is meant to resemble a small village.
2000-02-20	Marketing, as Taught By Credit Card Issuers	FOR Erica Butts, 18, a freshman at the University of Maryland, the credit card companies scattered around campus offering gifts like drink coolers and pens were hard to miss. They were even harder to ignore. ''They have lots of free stuff, and they keep bothering you until you can't say no,'' Ms. Butts said, recalling how she came to receive both Capital One and Citibank Visa cards.
2000-02-04	McCain Gets Big Payoff On Web Site	Do not be surprised if every resurgent, cash-poor presidential campaign begins shamelessly plugging its campaign Web sites, where Visa, MasterCard and Discover are accepted, no matter how small the donation. In the 48 hours since his resounding triumph in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, Senator John McCain of Arizona has dropped his campaign's Web address in nearly every nationally televised interview he has done.
2000-02-02	$25 AND UNDER; In Chelsea, a Leap Onto the Pan-Latin Bandwagon	SOME restaurants are so loud, and the acoustics so bad, that you can spend an entire evening saying nothing but: ''What? What'd you say?'' Tiring of that, you can always nod your head sagely, smile or frown, pretending to hear while following the unspoken cues as best you can. Or you can give up on talking entirely and lose yourself in the food. At Cuba Libre, a two-month-old pan-Latin restaurant in Chelsea, it's possible to be quite happy with the last alternative. The combination of loud voices, hard surfaces and raucous music that sometimes has the waiters dancing in the aisles is enough to make you want to scream, or shut up entirely. But while the food is not always consistent, some dishes are so good that you simply want to eat and sigh.
2000-01-27	Filing Your Taxes Online: It's Faster, More Accurate And Welcomed by I.R.S.

The advantages of filing taxes electronically using stand-alone or Internet-based software are numerous, the agency says.
2000-01-26	$25 AND UNDER; The Flavors of Korea: Robust, Forceful and Confident	EVERY cuisine has its moment in the sun. Ten years ago, Vietnamese restaurants moved hesitantly out of Chinatown anonymity into new and uncharted neighborhoods. With initial success came the Sally Field moment -- ''You really like me!'' -- and soon they were everywhere. Now, it appears to be Korean food's turn. In the last couple of years, several Korean restaurants have established downtown beachheads, including Woo Lae Oak in SoHo and Do Hwa in Greenwich Village. But the ultimate expression of confidence in the future of Korean restaurants may be Jin Dal Lae, a modest place that opened two months ago on the Upper West Side.
2000-01-26	A Trattoria as Well Meaning as Grandma	RESTAURANTS are not people, but they have personalities. The best ones can be a little difficult, even forbidding. Intellectually, you have to meet them halfway. There's no small talk. Others are like the not-too-bright, affable fellow who always greets you with a smile, a friendly wave and five dependable minutes of conversation about sports and the weather. La Nonna, a trattoria in Greenwich Village that opened in September, is definitely the sports-and-weather guy. It is also the scene of the most absurd meal I have ever eaten. By some oversight, La Nonna took my reservation on a night it was booked for a private party. The problem was discovered when I called to confirm, but I was assured that a table would be set up in the heated tent covering the garden. No problem.
2000-01-23	On the Way to the Movies, Seafood and More	JUST off Interstate 95's Exit 24, on the way to the Fairfield Cinemas at Bullard Square, there is the Black Rock Oyster Bar and Grill in Fairfield; it couldn't be handier. Small and compact, resembling a cozy bar more than a proper restaurant, this new seafood-oriented place offers a full dining service. While not huge, the menu is large enough to touch a number of bases, even including a few steak, barbecue and other Southern favorites as well as pasta selections. The emphasis, though, is indisputably on shellfish and fish.
2000-01-16	Where the Melange of Cuisine Is From Asia	JUDGING by the crowds in evidence on all our visits to Penang Grill in Greenwich, this new Malaysian restaurant has found a niche in a very short time. It is no wonder. In a town blessed with elegant and expensive dining establishments, an attractive restaurant with intriguing food at modest prices is more than welcome. Malaysia is a melting pot with the dominant elements coming from Thailand, India, Indonesia, and, most conspicuously, China. Add to this the local cooking called nonya, which combines Chinese techniques with Malaysian tropical ingredients. In Penang this employs the sour taste of lime and tamarind. All this makes for a lively stew and, in the case of Penang Grill, a menu more intriguing than the usual Chinese restaurant. We dived right in to sample starters beginning with the Thai spring roll; it had a crisply browned shell and fresh vegetables inside. A well-spiced satay chicken was jazzed up by a deliciously fiery peanut sauce. Then came classic Szechuan dumplings, well-made, but not record-breaking, and Thai crab cakes. Four small perfectly browned moist cakes each had a dab of incendiary sauce on top and slivers of green mango for a cool and different texture. Our only starter let-down was tempura shrimp, which came in a crisp, thick batter blanket with a glutinous lemon sauce topping. The Vietnamese salad was a wow, a refreshing alliance of jicama, shredded nappa or celery cabbage, carrots, mango, fresh cilantro, a slice of lime, and tangy tamarind peanut dressing. We were also smitten with calamari salad -- crispy squid rings and young greens in a perky lime miso dressing. Tom yam goong soup was another delight, a clear, peppery broth with shrimp, mushrooms, pineapple, cilantro and a lime slice on the side.
2000-01-03	Asian Exchanges Ushering In A Smooth Start to the Century	The first worldwide trading day of 2000 opened without difficulty this morning at stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, reassuring market officials that the global market is coping with the computer-related hurdles that arrived with the new millennium. Electronic trading systems at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, which handle trades in futures and options, also opened for business last night without a hitch.
1999-12-26	A United Nations Of Queens Choices	18 DE JULIO + (718) 429-5495; 77-05 37th Avenue, Jackson Heights; $; no smoking; Mastercard, Visa. If you're hungry for beef and plenty of it, this Uruguayan grill in Jackson Heights might be the place for you. You can also buy meat to take home at the retail butcher shop. The chicken, lentil or tripe soup are possibilities for starters. Current hot dishes, all accompanied by a salad or rice or french fries, include skirt steak, short ribs, breaded steak Napolitana and pork chops. Pasta dishes include spaghetti or ravioli with or without meat sauce. Sandwiches featuring filet mignon, veal, sweetbread and chorizo are also on the menu. ($25 and Under: 2/28/97)
1999-12-24	Retailers Look Back and See Online Shopping Is Gaining	Online holiday shopping is increasingly gnawing at the business of traditional retailers this year, with preliminary indications that seasonal Internet sales may nearly triple from last year. Visa, which represents about half the nation's credit card spending, estimates that Internet shoppers using its cards will have spent $1.47 billion this November and December, 179 percent more than in those months last year.
1999-12-19	Intriguing and Stylish, Not Far From Yale	IF you limit your New Haven visits to the small patch of turf that encompasses the Yale Art Gallery/Center for British Art/Yale Repertory Theater axis, you will miss Zinc, and that would be a pity. This smart-looking new restaurant, just two blocks from the above-mentioned attractions, is exciting for several reasons: A short menu of intriguing dishes at moderate prices is served by the best-trained staff we have encountered in ages.
1999-12-15	$25 AND UNDER; Going Where No Grilled Octopus Confit Has Gone Before	IT has been decided: The duty of ambitious little restaurants is to go where none have gone before, to colonize all corners of Manhattan, neighborhood by neighborhood, until everybody has equal access to foie gras appetizers. Such is the manifest destiny of restaurants, and for the last six weeks, 71 Clinton Fresh Food has been doing its part. How else to explain the improbable presence of this stylish 30-seat storefront restaurant in the heart of the Lower East Side? Fine dining in this neighborhood has historically meant garlic overload at Sammy's Roumanian, not Fresh Food's grilled octopus confit with quinoa, golden raisins and Chioggia beets ($7), which, by the way, is an excellent combination of sweet and savory flavors and textures.
1999-12-09	EToys Edges Toysrus.com In Ranking of Online Users	The holiday battle to be the leading toy store in cyberspace shifted last week as eToys, the Internet start-up, pulled ahead of Toysrus.com, the Web site of the big toy chain, according to the research company Media Metrix. EToys became the fourth most visited commerce site over all, with an average of 384,000 people visiting the site each day last week, an increase of 53 percent from the previous week and 71 percent from the most recent three-week average.
1999-12-05	Beyond The Glow Of Platinum	HOLDERS of the American Express Platinum card, especially those who delight in flashing it, may want to start leaving home without it. Here comes American Express's new black, invitation-only Centurion Card, created for big-spending frequent travelers for whom Platinum status is no longer enough. The annual cost is $1,000.
1999-12-01	$25 AND UNDER; A Deli on the Upper West Side With Weeks of Tradition	AS a child on Long Island, I used to fantasize about Andel's, the local Jewish delicatessen. I'd walk through the door to be captured in a billowy aromatic embrace of vinegar and coriander, cabbage and rye, garlic and pepper. I'd look at the glass display cases, piled high with potato knishes, kugels, whitefish and funny gummy candies that looked like slices of fruit. I'd see the franks on the grill with a tray of sauerkraut, and mysterious steaming canisters, where the pastrami and corned beef lived. If only I could be locked in the delicatessen overnight, I thought, free to eat whatever I wanted. You can't just open a place like Andel's -- or Katz's or the Carnegie, two of Manhattan's leading delis. They're products of years of noshing and kibitzing, with a patina of sights, sounds and smells as singular and cranky as the old men who used to run them. They are a dying breed, the conventional wisdom goes, a victim of changing demographics and a taste for healthier foods. A Jewish delicatessen in New York is as rare these days as a good egg cream.
1999-11-28	Peekskill Spot Offers Fare for the Few	IN these days of economic hubris, the Zephses Victoria at the stove and her brother Michael managing out front -- can offer a lesson in humility to other small family concerns. For almost 10 years this team has consistently pleased customers by following a simple, yet elegant plan of nonexpansion. Too many small gems compromise success by overreaching, but this restaurant has clearly decided to delight the discerning few. Where less particular restaurateurs would pack in six more tables in Zephs' space, not more than a comfortably spaced baker's dozen offer seating. Although only a handful of appetizers and entrees are offered, they are reinvented frequently and always executed with care. And what the menu describes is what the diner receives. If a touch of roasted pumpkin seed or black olive is promised, it is delivered.
1999-11-24	$25 AND UNDER; An Unconventional Spot in the East Village? How Strange	PRUNE is the name. Has a nice ring to it, no? I like it, if only because I love prunes. But in fact the restaurant does not honor the fruit. Prune was the childhood nickname of Gabrielle Hamilton, the chef and owner, who does not resemble a prune at all. Her restaurant is a plum.
1999-11-17	A Funny Thing's Happening in Chelsea	FOR a small restaurant, Vox has a lot of quirks. There's the name, to start with, a short, punchy syllable that shimmers above the door in Chrysler Building silver and an eye-catching Art Deco typeface. An allusion to ''vox populi,'' or ''the voice of the people,'' it sets up a mysterious Latin leitmotif that carries through to the wine list, which lists red wines under ''rubeo,'' white under ''albus,'' and sparkling under ''scintillo.'' Quirk No. 2 is a little furnished room right inside the entrance, which has already earned a measure of fame as New York's first cell phone zone. It's the isolation chamber to which cell phone users are escorted if they whip out their fiendish devices and begin thumb-dialing. I have never once seen anyone actually in the room, which has a couch, two upholstered chairs and a coffee table , and looks like a museum diorama showing how homo sapiens urbanus lived, circa 2000.
1999-11-16	New Battles Erupt In A.T.M. Fee War As Banks Retaliate	Lashawanda McCullom, a 30-year-old nurse, put her credit union's cash card into a Bank of America automated teller machine here, punched in her secret code and requested a withdrawal. The machine spit out her card and flashed a message: ''Due to a recent vote by the Santa Monica City Council, the convenience of this A.T.M. is now available to Bank of America cardholders only.'' Ms. McCullom, who expressed mild frustration at being denied her cash, was caught in the cross-fire of a skirmish over A.T.M. surcharges that now seems to be breaking into a full-fledged war. Suddenly, the fact that it costs an extra $1.50 or so to get money out of a cash machine seems to have tapped into some deep well of public resentment -- or at least politicians believe it has.
1999-11-14	Small Is Beautiful In Brooklyn	BADOO'S INTERNATIONAL RESTAURANT ++ (718) 345-7654; 5422 Church Avenue, at East 55th Street, Flatbush; $; no smoking; cash only. This tiny storefront serves wonderful jerk chicken, the barbecued dish of Jamaica. Beware of the sauce. It is spiked with Scotch bonnet peppers, which are fiery. The menu changes daily, but most days you can get pepper shrimp as an appetizer. Main dishes are all served with sides, like fried plantains, steamed carrots and white rice. Main dishes include oxtail; curried goat; fried fish; cubed steak with peppers; and an assortment of fish, including mackerel, ackee and salted cod. (Article: 8/21/98)
1999-11-04	A Chilly Welcome For Digital Wallets	YOU have hunted through countless Web sites, found the perfect gift at the best price. Now all that is left is to fill out an order form the length of a corporate tax return. For all its promises of unrestrained consumerism, the Web makes the act of paying a daunting task. Most sites force customers to peck out line after line of personal data and lengthy credit card numbers before they will take their money.
1999-10-31	The Siren Swipe of the Debit Card	LOOK at the people in front of you at the grocery check-out or at the gas pump. Odds are they are swiping plastic through a card-reading machine, cards that often are debit cards, not credit cards. Increasingly, banks are replacing simple A.T.M. cards with debit cards bearing the Visa or Mastercard logos, good not only for getting cash, but for shopping wherever those cards are accepted, with the money debited from the card holder's account.
1999-10-24	A Place Where the Tapas Are the Draw	SEATED in the large dining room of Macarena in Stamford, we mused at how different this was from the traditional Seville tapas bar, which would be hopping with people eating, drinking and talking at full throttle. Here the action was in the restaurant, where diners sat sedately eating their tapas and entrees. Sunday evening, two guitarists moved table to table, playing and singing softly. Originally, a tapa was a saucer with a few olives or almonds placed over a wine glass as a cover. At Macarena tapas come on standard dinner plates or in large terra cotta casseroles. Portions of some are generous enough for two or more to share. That's what four of us did recently, making a meal of seven tapas and desserts. It was certainly a mealsworth, for a total of $72.65, plus a bottle of excellent Marques de Vargas 1995 Rioja wine at $35, before tax and tip. Not bad for a foursome.
1999-10-20	$25 AND UNDER; In Brooklyn, a Neighborhood Spot With Ambition	I COULD tell right away that a place called Saul was serious and ambitious. The clue was the missing '' 's.'' Casual neighborhood places are called Fred's or Jerry's or Mergatroid's. But stir a little ambition into a restaurant's pot and it eliminates the Anglophone possessive faster than Eddie Fisher dropped Debbie Reynolds. These restaurants are called Daniel or Bouley Bakery. ''Not Bouley's, you fool,'' I can hear the chef rage, ''it's Bouley!''
1999-10-17	Brooklyn, Washed by the Sea	CAMBODIAN CUISINE + (718) 858-3262; 87 South Elliott Place, near Lafayette Street, Fort Greene; $; no smoking; Mastercard, Visa. Cambodian Cuisine uses tilapia, a mild freshwater fish that is fried and served in a creamy sauce flavored with lemon grass and basil, which gives the firm flesh a mellow, almost nutty flavor. Appetizers include sauteed ground beef in lemon grass spices served with slices of cucumber and carrot; fried fish balls with sweet vegetable pickle; and steamed Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce dressing. Some other seafood specialties include sauteed jumbo shrimp with black mushrooms, baby corn and broccoli in a hot spicy cream sauce; dry sauteed shrimp with shredded cabbage, onion and scallion; and fried slice of kingfish in a hot and spicy lemon grass cream sauce, served on a bed of lettuce. ($25 and Under: 5/30/97)
1999-10-17	In a New Haven Cafe, Piquant Turkish Fare	ISTANBUL CAFE in New Haven may be the next best thing to a trip to Turkey. Not only is the food authentic, but the place has the intimacy and bustle of a Turkish cafe. And the kitchen is not timid about seasoning, which gives many dishes the piquancy of legitimacy. Though we were hampered in ordering by our waitress's limited English and poor command of Turkish names and dishes, once over that hurdle, we settled down to a satisfying meal. Of many first-rate starters, imam bayildi, was noteworthy. Crusty, browned eggplant slices stuffed with green pepper, grilled onion, garlic, tomato and parsley, then sprinkled with pine nuts, made an ensemble of congenial ingredients and textures.
1999-10-10	Ports of Call In Chelsea	BRIGHT FOOD SHOP+ (212) 243-4433; 216 Eighth Avenue, between 21st and 22d Streets; $$; no smoking; cash only. This restaurant stands out in its blending of Southwestern and Asian ingredients. Appetizers include the Tijuana Caesar salad with smoky cornbread croutons, five-spice pork carnitas with coconut rice salad, picked cucumbers and chipotle peanut sauce; and chopped greens with cherry tomatoes, tomatillos, Sherry cumin vinaigrette and toasted tortilla strips. Main courses include barbecued pork chop with fresh corn polenta, greens and apple-green chile salsa, served with black beans; steamed halibut with sesame ginger pipian, jasmine rice in a caribe-lime leaf broth; moo shu Mexican vegetable hand rolls with chipotle peanut sauce and rice; and the shrimp and goat cheese quesadilla with white bean puree, corn, sun-dried tomatoes, green chilies and salsa fresca. ($25 and Under: 8/15/97)
1999-10-03	Name From Wagner, Cuisine From Spain	WHEN we walked into Tristan in Stratford, we did not know what the restaurant specializes in. One look at the menu -- steamed octopus, boquerones, chorizo, paella -- and the truth dawned on us A restaurant specializing in the cuisine of Spain -- notwithstanding a name borrowed from opera -- is still something of a rarity in Connecticut. Tristan does have a few other dishes: the ubiquitous pastas, Norwegian salmon, braised lamb shanks and black Angus steak au poivre noir.
1999-10-01	Visa to Trim Jobs In Reorganization	Visa International Inc., the world's biggest credit card association, said this week that it would dismiss 120 to 140 people as it gives its member banks more control over the business. The jobs, representing about 2.5 percent of Visa's worldwide work force, will be eliminated in its headquarters here on Friday, Dave Brancoli, a spokesman, said.
1999-09-29	$25 AND UNDER; Tapas That Work Up an Appetite for the Intellect	A RECENT survey declared Columbia University to be one of the nation's top 10 universities, but the authors obviously didn't take restaurants in its Morningside Heights neighborhood into account. While the area is full of fast-food outlets and mediocre restaurants serving international cuisines, the sorts of dark, romantic, faintly bohemian spots so alluring to students the world over are practically nonexistent. Dalia's, a tapas restaurant that opened about two months ago within walking distance of Columbia, may change that. Judging by the discussion of ''bourgeois praxis'' at the table on one side of me and ''popular culture as ephemeral waste'' on the other side, the graduate students have already found the place, and it's easy to see why it's so attractive to them. By their nature, tapas are inexpensive and conducive to good discussions. Essentially Spanish bar food, tapas are uncomplicated, intended to deliver one or two forceful flavors a dish while, of course, inspiring thirst.
1999-09-20	BUSINESS DIGEST	Microsoft May Announce Narrower Internet Plans The Microsoft Corporation is expected to make a series of announcements this week that are intended to showcase its new, narrower focus as a supplier of software for the World Wide Web and electronic commerce services. Microsoft will announce today an alliance between its MSN Carpoint, an on-line car shopping service, and the Ford Motor Company, according to consultants who have been told of the agreement. Further plans for the future of its MSN Internet-access service and for placing its popular Office productivity software on the Web could come Thursday, when Microsoft executives are scheduled to meet with industry analysts and the press.

1999-09-20	A new piece of hardware could help Internet merchants cut fraud-associated costs, if it catches on among consumers.	CREDIT card companies love the Internet, since they pocket a share of most E-commerce transactions. But like everything in the world of revolving credit, that love has limits. Stolen cards used to make purchases on line, in particular, cost credit card issuers millions each year -- pushing the price of doing business on the Web higher for banks, merchants and, ultimately, users. So even as the major credit card companies and the banks that issue those cards explore ways to build Internet market share, they are also looking for ways to limit fraud.
1999-09-19	Near the Movies, a Tiny Cafe With Big Ideas	JUST a few steps from the Crown Sono Regent in South Norwalk we discovered a tiny gem, the new Cafe Milano. Nothing fancy, we presumed, but an order of bruschetta, toasted crusty bread spilling over with chopped ripe tomatoes and pungent garlic, a glass of Atlantic Amber and a glance at the compact Italian menu convinced us to return with alacrity. One delicious dish followed another. Each was so rewarding we wanted to sample as many as possible on visit after visit. While the menu is brief, there is always a printed list of specials.
1999-09-05	Near Goodspeed, an Eatery's Spirited Revival	WITH views of the Connecticut River as glorious as those from the Gelston House in East Haddam, the food doesn't have to be great. Fortunately, the food at the handsome old establishment is -- with very few cavils -- the best it has been in years. The Italianate Victorian house has long functioned in tandem with the the Goodspeed Opera House, just a few steps away, serving theatergoers before and after performances. But in recent decades, Gelston House has had more downs than ups as chefs and owners came and went; it even closed for five years. Now the restaurant is in an up mode and seems to be stablized, probably because it is in the hands of experienced managers and restaurateurs, the Carbone family, owners of two Hartford mainstays, Carbone's and Gaetano's.
1999-08-30	ESPN Celebrates Big Success in a Small, Grateful Town	Back in 1978, when television sets came with rabbit ears, city leaders here were so proud of the fledgling company they had just landed that they put up a big wooden sign welcoming the ''E.S.P. Network.'' Even after locals learned that their new neighbor went by ESPN and planned to offer sports, not psychics, the concept of cable and satellites remained exotic. Farmers phoned City Hall to find out if they could charge the new network for air rights over their land, to allow passage of the scores and highlights that would soon be spit heavenward by the big white satellite dishes.
1999-08-29	Country Inn Near, but Not Too Near, the Glitz	WITH few exceptions, elegance and sophistication are not words that leap to mind when thinking of dining out in the Northeast Corner. But Stonecroft in Ledyard is quietly changing that perception. Stonecroft occupies the ground level of a pale yellow clapboard building, part of a small country inn complex in the woods outside Ledyard. Getting to the restaurant from the parking lot in front is a bit goofy: up a flight of stairs to the front door, then once inside, down a flight to the dining room. An easier way is to walk around behind the building, then enter the dining room directly from the terrace, eliminating all the up-the-down-staircases. The restaurant itself is a real charmer, stylish and faux rustic at the same time.
1999-08-25	$25 AND UNDER; Ode to a Southern Grandmother (Gravy, Greens and All)	ONE of my favorite places in Harlem used to be Wilson's restaurant and bakery, at 158th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. I'd go there early on Sunday mornings, trying to beat the after-church crowd, and order salmon croquettes, served with eggs, grits and biscuits. At the pace of a Southern drawl, the food would arrive, swimming in butter, the football-shape croquettes crisp yet moist, flavored with onions and parsley, blending perfectly with the grits and eggs (and butter). To finish, I'd have a piece of sweet potato pie or even sweeter peach cobbler. But after holding down that corner for decades, Wilson's closed a couple of years ago, and I've missed those croquettes ever since. Imagine my surprise when I ordered salmon croquettes for breakfast recently at Amy Ruth's, a bright new Southern restaurant on West 116th Street, and there they were! At least, they looked the same, tapered cylinders with a crisp coating of fried bread crumbs. And then, when I tasted the savory chopped salmon, I knew; these were Wilson's croquettes.
1999-08-25	Voila! A Bistro Suddenly Finds Its Footing	LET me tell you about tonight's specials,'' the waiter said. Several shining faces looked up at him expectantly. ''Tonight, we got no specials.'' Well, that simplified matters, at any rate. I asked what white wines he had by the glass. ''Sauvignon blanc and chardonnay,'' he said. There seemed to be an information blackout on further details. My wife, hope fading fast, ordered a glass of Champagne. She got an execrable sparkling wine. It looked as if it was going to be a long, long evening.
1999-08-22	Taking a Serious Approach to Italian Fare	FROM the paved walk with wooden benches outside the restaurant to the sparkling glassware and spotless table settings within, every detail at Il Pranzo in Branford seems to have been carefully planned. (The sheltering oak tree over the benches is a bonus.) That same meticulous attention has been focused even more closely on the northern Italian food. The menu isn't large, but it is certainly interesting, and, in all four categories -- antipasti, insalata, pasta and secondo piatto -- there are exciting choices.
1999-08-15	The Melting Pot Of Astoria	BALKH SHISH KABAB HOUSE + (718) 721-5020; 23-10 31st Street, near 23d Avenue; $; smoking at outdoor tables; all major credit cards. The food of mountainous Afghanistan is served at Balkh, a simple restaurant with a breezy garden named after a town north of Kabul. While kebabs are the restaurant's namesake, the highlight of the menu is the dumplings -- either ashak, a lacy ravioli stuffed with scallions and served in a wonderful sauce of yogurt and grilled onions, or manto, stuffed with ground beef and served in the same sauce. Bolani is another excellent appetizer, flat bread stuffed with potato, pumpkin or scallion, fried crisp and served with a soothing yogurt sauce. For the main course, kebabs like the tika kebab, grilled chunks of lamb, and keema kebab, cylinders of ground beef, are fine, but other dishes are more interesting. Kabli kofta is brown rice blended with sweet cooked carrots, raisins and bits of tender lamb, and sabzey chalow is a mild lamb and spinach curry. Paya, a specialty of the house, is baked calf's foot; it is served with Afghan bread. For dessert, you may be offered a free bite of sherperah, a wonderful sweet pistachio pastry. ($25 and Under: 9/9/98)
1999-08-15	A Credit Card Loophole Can Ensnare Retailers	IT was the sort of telephone call a small businessman dreams of. The caller promised to increase by perhaps 5 percent the $1.6 million annual revenue of the computer sales and service company that Gary C. McLendon founded in Fayetteville, Ark., 16 years ago. Scarcely 10 weeks later, however, Mr. McLendon is struggling to absorb hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses to an overseas credit card scam that has consumed the company's cash reserves and devoured his equity in its building. ''Here I am -- 54 years old and starting over again,'' Mr. McLendon said.
1999-08-03	Start-Up Offering iMac's to Lure Customers	A Los Angeles-based start-up company said today that beginning next month it intended to give away one million of Apple Computer Inc.'s popular iMacs to customers who sign up for its Internet service. The news briefly sent Apple shares to a new 52-week high, but they had settled back by the close of the market. The start-up, Freemac.com, said it would give away iMacs to customers who qualified for a Freemac-brand Visa card and agreed to pay $19.95 a month for three years for Internet service. Freemac said it was a partner with Earthlink Network, a major Internet service provider; First USA, the Visa and Mastercard issuing subsidiary of the Bank One Corporation; Cybercash, an electronic commerce company, and Peter Max, the 1960's pop artist, who will serve as spokesman and ''chief creativity officer.''
1999-08-01	A Culinary Shift In Williamsburg	DINER + (718) 486-3077; 85 Broadway, at Berry Street; $; smoking permitted; Visa and Mastercard. The owners of this tattered luncheonette practically underneath the Williamsburg Bridge had the good sense not to create a diner-theme restaurant. Instead, they bring the diner idea up to date, offering the sort of everyday food that appeals to the art crowd. Appetizers like simple green salad, goat cheese salad and mussels in a white wine broth, served with crisp, freshly cut fries, are well made. Main courses are also well prepared. Dishes that are always on the menu include a fine, thick hamburger, a moist roast chicken with mashed potatoes and admirable rib eye and skirt steaks. Perfectly cooked whole trout, served boned and simply flavored with herbs, is a frequent special. Unlike real diners, Diner does not offer breakfast, but it does serve weekend brunch. Along with the usual pancakes and waffles, there's an exceptional special of grilled trout scrambled with eggs. A flourless chocolate cake is among the best desserts. ($25 and Under: 4/21/99)
1999-08-01	Homey and Upstairs, for a Diversity of Dishes	AT Charlotte, a new restaurant in Lakeville, the appeal begins in the attractively cozy lounge-waiting room on the main floor and continues on the stairway to the main dining room on the second floor. Part of one wall has been cut out for a large window, so as diners climb the steps they are able to watch the action in the bustling, spotless kitchen below. The small upstairs dining room has been bisected, making it even homier, enhanced by walls with antique artifacts. The menu, which combines American, Italian and French elements, also borrows a few ingredients from Asia. Euphoria sets in with a starter of seared Hudson Valley foie gras, which was delivered on toasted barley, laced with balsamic vinaigrette, a mild texture contrast, though the foie gras was perfection all by itself. Something called potato foofoo was absent, but, whatever it was, it wasn't likely to improve the dish.
1999-07-25	Breaking the Mold In Yorkville	LA FORET + (212) 987-9839; 1713 First Avenue, between 88th and 89th Streets; $; no smoking; cash only. In an area where just-out-of-college revelers bounce among a multitude of bars, La Foret is an adult refuge, a small, simply decorated place that turns out exquisitely composed dishes at affordable prices. When it's available, risotto is a rich, delicious appetizer. Mussels are small and tender, terrific in their slightly thickened sauce of wine, garlic and herbs. The simple green salad arrives perfectly dressed, while arugula salad is served with marinated fennel and oranges. Among the main dishes, tender filet mignon is exceptional with sauteed spinach in a red wine sauce. Leg of lamb is slowly roasted with garlic and thyme and served with potato puree, vegetables and meat jus. Salmon is served with corn, sweet peas and shiitake mushrooms as well as sweet pea and red wine reduction sauces. For dessert, chocolate mousse is delicious. ($25 and Under: 5/20/98)
1999-07-22	Chase Manhattan Earnings Show Strength in All Areas	The Chase Manhattan Corporation said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose a greater-than-expected 25 percent partly because of strength in Internet investments, trading, investment banking and credit cards. Profit from operations rose to $1.35 billion, or $1.55 a diluted share, compared with $1.08 billion, or $1.21 a share, in the 1998 quarter. Analysts had expected Chase to earn $1.37 a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks earnings.
1999-07-18	Short Menu, Tall Ideas in New American Style	TIBWIN GRILL, in a corner brownstone diagonally across from the Shubert Theater on College Street, is the latest entry along what has become New Haven's restaurant row. Tibwin Grill's short menu features food in the New American style, with the added twist of some eye-popping tri-level presentations. The combination of New American and architectural display often produces priceyness. The surprise at Tibwin Grill is how reasonable everything is. No entree (save an occasional special) is above $18, and appetizers are mostly $5 or $6, with a $7 ceiling. Nobody at our table leaped at the prospect of red potato tart, but we ordered it anyway, hoping it would be better than it sounded. To our delight, it was. Cooked red potato wheels rested on a sauteed tortilla spread with heated goat cheese, which in turn sat on a frisee salad tossed with bacon. Dabs of a sharp-edged olive tapenade decorated the plate and added to the taste contrasts, which were considerable -- tart, bland, sharp, sweet.
1999-06-27	First Lady in a Messy Fight On the Eve of Her Campaign	Since the collapse of her health care project in 1994, Hillary Rodham Clinton has seemed to retreat from the gladiator pit of high-profile policy issues, devoting herself instead to less visible topics like foster care and adoption. But for more than a year, Mrs. Clinton has been engaged behind the scenes on a legislative issue -- consumer bankruptcy -- that could prove politically tricky for other Democrats and for her own political ambitions.
1999-06-27	From Queens Tables To South America	18 DE JULIO+ (718) 429-5495; 77-05 37th Avenue, Jackson Heights; $; no smoking; Visa and Mastercard. The whine of a meat saw occasionally cuts through the chatter of diners at this bright, plain Uruguayan grill. Dishes come with a choice of rice, french fries or salad, but the focus is on beef and plenty of it. The highlight of the menu is the entrana, a skirt steak stretching the length of a blimp-shaped plate. Shell steak arrives as a thick, juicy cut, and both steaks are available as half-orders. The buttery tender filet mignon, however, comes in only one size. Don't care for steak? You may want to try the combination platter, a tasty mixture of meaty, fibrous short ribs, sweet sausage, savory blood sausages and chewy sweetbreads. Flan is popular for dessert.

1999-06-26	Mastercard Will Let Banks Move Its Logo	Mastercard International Ltd.'s board has voted to allow member banks to move the Mastercard logo to the back of the credit and debit cards they issue, giving the banks more opportunity to promote their own brands. Mastercard said the move, which was expected, was an effort to be responsive to the desires of its member banks. Some of them, especially larger banks, want the faces of their cards to emphasize their own logos instead of sharing the space with Mastercard's, as they do now.
1999-06-20	A Starry Array In the Village	BABBO *** [rating: three stars] (212) 777-0303; 110 Waverly Place, near Avenue of the Americas; $$$; smoking at bar; all major credit cards.
1999-06-20	Making a Meal of Intriguing Appetizers	THE River Cat Grill in Rowayton has the right idea for the millennium. Rather than the usual menu of appetizers and entrees, the new restaurant in a familiar locale offers a menu consisting mainly of starters. There is only one entree-sized (and priced) item on the menu. This makes great sense. Often a chef's most creative efforts go into the starters. Thus River Cat Grill makes official what many discerning diners have done for years: make a meal of intriguing appetizers.
1999-06-14	Developing a Repetition-Free Language for Web Transactions	Aiming to make shopping on the Web easier, a consortium of credit card companies, Internet merchants and developers of on-line payment technologies plans to announce today that its members have agreed to develop a standard for executing electronic commerce transactions. The standard, known as electronic commerce modeling language, will eventually enable consumers to buy from multiple Web sites without re-entering data like a name, shipping address or credit card number. The coding of so-called electronic wallet software will store such customer information on a secure server and is intended to pass the data to different merchants' Web sites with fewer problems.
1999-06-13	Plates Piled High (and Children's Menu, Too)	DESPITE its difficult-to-find location on a dead-end street in Madison, Lynch & Malone's has clearly become a local favorite in its four years of operation. Even early on a Monday evening the bar was doing a brisk business. By 7:30 the restaurant was about two-thirds full and things were lively. A subsequent mid-week visit proved just as busy. What makes Lynch & Malone's work for its loyal fans are a friendly, low-key atmosphere, more-than-generous portions of competently prepared food and reasonable prices.
1999-06-06	Interest Rebate Card Dies	As the Cornerstone Mastercard program of Mellon Bank comes to an end, customers are being freed from a dubious, though superficially attractive, bargain. The deal, begun by the bank in 1993, was that consumers would get all their interest payments back in a rebate -- after 20 years. In return, they had to pay a high interest rate on unpaid balances -- the prime rate plus 11.9 percentage points, or, currently, 19.65 percent.
1999-06-06	Selections That Evoke the Sea	MENTION Massapequa and the conversation invariably turns to Jerry Seinfeld, Joey Buttafuoco and other famous former residents. Now Clearwater, a new restaurant, is getting some of that attention. This striking canal-side spot is the baby of Michael Meehan and Paavo Raudkivi, who also own the highly regarded Tupelo Honey in Sea Cliff. Now South Shore residents can enjoy Mr. Meehan's exciting, eclectic cooking and be served by Mr. Raudkivi's well-trained staff.
1999-05-28	Joke Brings Suspension and Reversal	Snezan Cebic, a Manhattan high school senior, downloaded the joke a month ago from an Internet chat room frequented by students at the University of Wisconsin. It was a parody of those treacly, ubiquitous television commercials that invite viewers to use their Mastercards in search of ''priceless'' moments -- a father and son at a ball game, a daughter's pilgrimage to her ancestral home in Ireland. Only this time, the punch line zoomed into the high school shooting rampage in Littleton, Colo.
1999-05-23	The Flight To Precious Plastics	FOR 15 years, the American Express Platinum card has stood alone among charge cards, offering its affluent holders valuable goodies from free companion tickets in first or business class on international flights to complimentary massages at chic resorts.
1999-05-12	METRIS STOCK RISES ON PLANS TO BUY CREDIT CARD HOLDINGS	Shares of the Metris Companies rose 10.6 percent yesterday after it agreed to buy most of the GE Capital Corporation's Mastercard and Visa credit card portfolio and said it would split its stock 2 for 1. Shares rose $6.6875, to $70. The stock of the credit card issuer has gained 39.1 percent this year. Investors and analysts said they were optimistic Metris's acquisition of $1.3 billion in credit card loans and 563,000 accounts from GE Capital, a unit of the General Electric Company, would add to earnings this year because of its success with previous purchases. Terms were not disclosed.
1999-05-12	New Asian Accents Amid Old World Details	ONCE there was a restaurant called the Park. Serving contemporary American fare, it opened in 1997 in the Lombardy Hotel, a sumptuous turn-of-the century building that is now an apartment house. Two years later, the restaurant has a new chef, a new menu and a new wooden floor. It also has a new name: Soma Park. Soma? Even before my first visit, the name gave me pause. The owner was making a sly reference to the Prozac-like pleasure drug that was dispensed by the government in Aldous Huxley's ''Brave New World.''
1999-05-11	GE Capital to Sell Credit Card Portfolios	The GE Capital Corporation, the world's biggest finance company, agreed today to sell most of its Mastercard and Visa credit card portfolio to the Metris Companies. Metris, based in St. Louis Park, Minn., a card issuer to consumers with limited or tarnished credit histories, will acquire $1.3 billion in loans and 563,000 accounts from GE Capital, a unit of General Electric. Terms were not disclosed.
1999-05-09	Where Auteurs Learn the ABC's	FOR Penelope Spheeris, it was four years of paradise. For Barry Sonnenfeld, it was three years of purgatory. But as these two successful Hollywood directors acknowledge, their common experience -- earning a graduate degree from a top-flight film school -- helped lay the foundation for their present careers. ''What's cool is that you get to make movies,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said of his sleep-deprived days at New York University, from which he obtained a master's degree in 1978. ''And that's how you learn.'' Mr. Sonnenfeld's directing credits include ''Men in Black,'' ''Get Shorty'' and the two Addams Family movies; his new film, ''The Wild, Wild West,'' based on the 1960's television series and starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh, is to be released on July 2.
1999-05-09	Erase That Debt, or Take More	Weary consumers with stacks of monthly bills can turn to several Web sites to help them manage debt, including a new one, Credit Page, at creditpage.com. It started last month. Some of its links are to counseling groups that offer advice on debt management and help consumers by setting up payment plans and mediating on their behalf with creditors. The counseling groups are financed primarily by contributions from lenders.
1999-05-09	Insurers and Uninsured Put Hospitals in a Squeeze	AFTER a run of profitable years, hospitals across the country face cash-flow problems -- squeezed, officials say, by slow-paying managed-care companies, cutbacks in government programs and rapidly growing numbers of uninsured patients. Pressured by rising costs, hospitals are aggressively trying to collect mountains of overdue bills for patient care. According to the hospitals, managed-care companies are routinely delaying payments by three or four months, even in states where delays that long are illegal, often by reporting that they have lost track of bills, including those transmitted electronically.
1999-05-05	A Dinner Party Among Intimate Strangers	CONTEMPLATING a navel not my own is hardly what I expected to be doing at an Upper East Side restaurant. But there I was on a recent spring evening, transfixed by the navel just above the elastic band of a lace-trimmed brown half-slip masquerading as a skirt. I should have been looking up at the wearer as she spoke to me, but her navel was at eye level. ''How was the food?'' asked the woman, who owns Amaranth, a restaurant of showy casualness.
1999-04-27	Successor Is Selected to Run American Express	The American Express Company said yesterday that Kenneth I. Chenault would succeed Harvey Golub as chief executive in 2001. That move would elevate a black executive into the ranks of the country's top corporate leaders. If the succession takes place and no other black executives secure a key to the chief executive's suite before then, Mr. Chenault would join Franklin D. Raines, head of the mortgage-financing giant Fannie Mae, as the only black leaders of Fortune 500 companies.
1999-04-25	Exploring a Very Budget-Minded Buffet	IF Chinese restaurants have taken over Connecticut, as a friend avers, Tat's-on-Summer Chinese Buffet in Stamford has gone one step farther, offering an all-you-can-eat buffet at lunch and dinner. The restaurant's prime downtown location makes it a natural for moviegoers. Adding to the convenience, the buffet carry-out at $5.95 (soft drinks included) available Monday through Friday seems to be a magnet for workers in the vicinity in search of a quick and easy lunch.
1999-04-25	In Any Language, a New Expense	LIKE bargaining at open-air markets, using a credit card for purchases in foreign countries has long been a financial given for seasoned travelers. That's because the exchange rates offered by credit cards have generally been better than those at local currency exchange counters. But some travelers are finding their credit-card shopping a little more expensive than it used to be as some card issuers are adding fees on transactions in foreign currencies. As a result, while it still may pay for travelers to use their credit cards overseas, it may pay even more for them to choose their card carefully.
1999-04-18	East 14th to 19th: A Global Sampler	BAMBOU ** [Rating: Two Stars] (212) 358-0012; 243 East 14th Street, between Second and Third Avenues; $$; smoking at bar; all major credit cards; dinner only. Bambou brings the feel of the Caribbean to a dreary stretch of East 14th Street, with a selection of tropical drinks, a cozy lounge filled with plants and plump sofas, a green-walled dining room in which fans stir the air, and a fascinating mix of food. First courses include steamed mussels in a broth that tastes of lime, coconut and curry; crisp crab cakes set on smooth avocado butter, and Bambou shrimp, encrusted in coconut and sweetly tasty. A main course of grilled chicken is rubbed with jerk, the potent Jamaican blend of seasonings, and served on rice and black-eyed peas; shell steak comes with plantains and sauteed callaloo, the taro plant's dark green leaves. Desserts are special, too. The tropical fruit plate is a rainbow of colors and tastes, and the coconut creme brulee is fabulous. The wine list is nicely varied, with a good selection by the glass. (Review: 10/11/96)
1999-03-31	GIVE AND TAKE: When Charity Begins on Line; Pitfalls for Internet Shoppers With Charitable Bent	As Americans become increasingly comfortable shopping on line, it is a pitch many succumb to: Buy an Elmo toy or a Stephen King novel through a given Web site, and part of the purchase price will go to the charity of your choice. ''I already like to shop on line,'' said Sissy Brunk, who patronizes iGive.com, one of at least a half-dozen sites making this pitch. ''It makes you feel good that while you are shopping, a little bit goes to a worthy cause.'' She is convinced she is helping a children's charity she admires.
1999-03-24	Glitzing Up The West Side	SWINGING his coat off his shoulders, the man by the door knocks the young woman behind him off her feet. ''I'm so sorry,'' he apologizes, ''there is just no room.'' Turning to help her up, he finds himself staring down at a little girl who is crawling through the legs of the crowd to reach the exit. A waiter looks despairingly at the impenetrable mass of people, hoists his heavily laden tray above his head and gingerly picks his way to the tables by the window. ''I hope you don't drop that,'' says one woman he passes. ''This is a new suit.'' She turns to the harried hostess and wails, ''Can you tell me when we'll be seated?'' Just another Friday night at Ruby Foo's Dim Sum and Sushi Palace. Stephen Hanson owns the nearby Ocean Grill and Isabella's, so he must have known the Upper West Side suffered from a serious glitz gap before he opened the most sensational restaurant in the area. But he obviously underestimated just how wide that gap was. People were knocking on the windows and begging to come in even before the restaurant's January opening. ''I tried to get a reservation the first weekend,'' said one older woman, who lives nearby. ''Do you know what time they offered me? 10:30!''
1999-03-21	Where Oversize Entrees Are the Magnet	CAFE BELLA VITA was immediately likable, with its complementary color scheme and vibrant original art on the sponge-painted walls. It was so attractive, in an understated way, that we began rooting for it immediately. Even the recitation of nightly specials didn't irritate us as much as usual because they were few in number. We withheld comment when the dried-out slices of bread arrived, looking forward to the intriguing-sounding appetizers. Then disappointment reared up, first in the grilled shrimp -- several gooey, dripping jumbos that had been bathed unappetizingly in a horseradish remoulade. Crispy flash-fried calamari was ample enough to double as a light entree, with an abundance of leggy squid. Unfortunately, the batter enveloping them was doughy and undercooked, not the least crispy.
1999-03-14	The Lullabies Of West Broadway	BAROLO** [Rating: Two Stars] (212) 226-1102; 398 West Broadway, near Spring Street; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards. This SoHo institution is a large, warm, beautifully designed establishment that manages to be both casual and elegant, and in the summer the outdoor garden is delightful. Antipasti include grilled scallops with couscous; roasted veal carpaccio with tuna and caper sauce, and a spinach-and-ricotta flan. The homemade spaghetti in a tomato-drenched sauce with basil is recommended. There are several other pastas, including a ravioli of the day. Among the entrees are rack of lamb, fried calamari, grilled salmon steak with mustard-honey sauce, and sliced sirloin with rosemary and arugula. Poached pear-and-almond tart, cornmeal-crusted apple tart, and a chocolate cake filled with mascarpone honey cream are some of the desserts. The wine list is heavy with excellent Italian wines, especially Barolos. (Review: 1/14/94)
1999-03-11	Citigroup Joins Mastercard's Smaller Board	Citigroup joined a slimmed-down board of Mastercard International yesterday, a month after leaving Visa International's board as competition between the credit card groups intensifies. Citigroup, the world's biggest financial services company, will be one of 17 members of the Mastercard board. The board, which previously had 31 members, was shrunk to make it more nimble as the credit card industry is becoming increasingly dominated by a few, large companies.
1999-03-11	BUSINESS DIGEST	Dow Jones and S.& P. 500 Establish Record Highs The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set new highs as oil prices soared, but concerns about technology-company earnings crimped gains in the Nasdaq composite index.
1999-03-03	Mastercard Renews World Cup Pact	Mastercard International said yesterday that it had renewed its sponsorship of the World Cup soccer tournament with FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association), the world governing body for soccer, in an agreement that is estimated to total $140 million over four years for advertising, marketing promotion and sponsorship fees. The sponsorship covers the World Cup in 2002, with an option to renew for 2006 at the same price.
1999-02-28	Trip of Discoveries, Some Unhappy, in Iran	THE GROUP of female American tourists danced a crowd-stopping dance of the veil. Outside the vast shrine in the center of Mashad, Iran, the women struggled with their chadors, shroudlike garments that cover all but the face and must be secured with one hand held under the chin. There are no hooks or zippers to make the job easier. It wasn't enough that we were already wearing scarves on our heads and loose garments that hid the shape of our torsos. This was the holiest pilgrimage site in Iran, the place where Imam Reza, the eighth of the 12 imams, or religious leaders, in Shiite Islam, died in the ninth century and is buried. And even though the shrine itself was off limits to non-Muslims, we were allowed to walk through the outer courtyard, watch an informational film at a foreign reception center and tour the museums on the vast compound. But only if we disguised ourselves in the veils that our guide handed out as we emerged from our bus.
1999-02-21	Civilization by the Cup: Places to Pause for Tea And a Whole Lot More	MY mother grew her own. During the summer, our garden was filled with small white flowers with fragrant yellow centers. She picked them, dried them and tucked them away in her pantry for safekeeping. Whenever I was troubled by nightmares, her ministrations were swift and comforting. She tossed a handful of dried flowers into a pot of boiling water, strained the liquid and served it in a teacup. Before me was the sweet, honey-scented fragrance of chamomile, about as soothing an offering as could ever be set before a child.
1999-02-13	Visa U.S.A. Votes to Continue Ad Effort Based on Its Brand	The board of directors of Visa U.S.A. voted yesterday to keep the Visa brand name at the center of the credit card group's marketing campaigns after the banking giant Citigroup left Visa in protest over the issue. Citigroup, which has said it intends to promote increased awareness of the Citi brand name, contended that Visa's ubiquitous advertising campaigns undermined that mission. Two Citigroup executives resigned from Visa's 12-member board last week, reducing to 11 the number of banks whose executives sit on the board. Citigroup plans to shift all new business to Mastercard International.
1999-02-11	Detente Over, Visa Faces Industry Shake-Up	Last fall, Visa International gave three of the nation's largest banks extra seats on its board to appease the giants' concerns that they got too little bang for their buck from the credit card association. Visa, which is owned by a consortium of banks that share marketing and processing costs for the credit card network, had been sparring with the newly merged banking behemoths, especially Citigroup and the BankAmerica Corporation, about how advertising and related issues should be handled; additional board seats were awarded to help calm things down.
1999-02-10	Citigroup Officials Leave Visa's Board of Directors	Citigroup, the nation's second-largest issuer of credit cards, has taken the first steps toward abandoning a decades-old marketing relationship with Visa International in an attempt to create greater awareness of its own Citibank brand name. John S. Reed, Citigroup's co-chairman, and Robert Lipp, co-head of the company's consumer-banking operation, both resigned from Visa's board on Friday following months of disagreements between the two companies about branding issues, Citigroup and Visa spokesmen said.
1999-02-07	Tennis, er, Maybe the Menu, Anyone?	ONE can easily miss the set-back entrance to this engaging waterside restaurant, a wooden structure -- like the bar of a dumbbell -- between two billowy tennis bubbles. Part of the Hudson Valley Health and Tennis Club, this second-story restaurant shares its space with an exposed business office of sorts, manned by staff that seemed surprised that we were there for a meal. That awkward welcome aside, the Upstairs Cafe turned out to be a beguiling destination, even though a game of tennis was not on our menu. Because of the splendid view of the Hudson River, we thought dining here would be better enjoyed in daylight hours, but evening brought into focus a sight just as delightful. Floodlights illuminated the dark surrounding waters, and although the view was limited, pretty lights from distant river craft took on a magical quality as they passed. And directly beneath the ribbon of windows that wrap the river side of the dining room, geese -- surely at least 100 in the gaggle -- bobbed contentedly on the icy gray water.
1999-02-04	BANK ONE AND AMERICA ONLINE SIGN CREDIT CARD DEAL	America Online Inc., the No. 1 on-line service, signed a five-year agreement to market credit cards over the Internet with the Bank One Corporation's First U.S.A. unit, the largest provider of Mastercard and Visa cards in the United States. Through the agreement, First U.S.A. will pay American Online up to $500 million to be the provider of a co-branded card and be the exclusive marketer of credit card products and services on America Online, the Compuserve on-line service, AOL.com and AOL Instant Messenger in the United States and Canada. The two companies established a co-branded Visa card in 1996, and the new agreement extends that connection.
1999-01-31	Trying Out Tastes Before the Theater	CHURRASCARIA PLATAFORMA ** [Rating: two stars] (212) 245-0505; 316 West 49th Street; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards; live music Wednesday through Saturday nights. A large appetite and a large group are recommended for maximum enjoyment at this Brazilian steakhouse. One can fill one's plate with vegetables at the large salad bar, which is never allowed to empty, and sample four hot casseroles as well, which may include paella, octopus stew, black rice with squid, and tutu de feijao (a mixture of red beans, bacon and ground yuca flour topped with garlicky shredded kale). But these are only appetizers: the meat parade starts afterward. The waiters offer ham, sausage, lamb, crisp and juicy chicken legs, pork ribs, the occasional side of salmon, and many cuts of beef -- all sliced at the table. When you're ready to cry uncle, the dessert cart arrives, with passion fruit mousse, Brazilian coconut flan, cakes and other sweets. All you can eat for $26.95 at lunch and $30.95 at dinner.

1999-01-30	A Credit Card for Every Occasion	Every January, inch-thick credit card statements clog the mailbox, the unwelcome aftermath of year-end celebrations. But it could be worse -- $5.7 million worse. That's how much debt my family would have if we had taken advantage of all the credit cards and home-equity loans offered to us in 1998. Even at low, low introductory rates of 3.9 percent, the interest on $5.7 million comes to a mind-boggling $222,000 per year, or a little more than one minute's income for Bill Gates.
1999-01-26	Citigroup's 4th-Quarter Operating Earnings Plunged 27%	Citigroup, still struggling to revive its corporate banking business, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter operating earnings plunged 27 percent, although the weak performance was bolstered by a strong showing from the consumer banking operation and exceeded analysts' expectations. Citigroup, created last year by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., said its Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit continued to post extremely poor results, particularly in bond trading, although the company's overall performance in volatile emerging markets showed a sharp rebound from recent problems it had encountered.
1999-01-13	$25 AND UNDER; Senegalese Cooking, With Lots of Warmth	CHEZ GNAGNA KOTY'S calls itself an international restaurant, serving African, African-American and French cuisine. The chef and owner, Gnagna Diene, says she will cook whatever you like. But the pride of Chez Gnagna (pronounced NYAH-nyah) is in its Senegalese stews, hearty well-flavored meals that are rich and comforting. If you are not familiar with West African cooking, Chez Gnagna is a fine place to try it. This small storefront, with bright halogen lighting and a colorful kente cloth decor punctuated by a huge picture of President Clinton shaking hands with Abdou Diouf, the Senegalese President, is exceptionally friendly and considerate. Ms. Diene and her staff members take pains to make sure you understand the menu and enjoy the food, which they serve with big dollops of peppery hot sauce, for those who want to feel the heat. Devotees may recall Ms. Diene from the Lucky Star Deli on West 50th Street, a sandwich shop that also dispenses fine Senegalese food. This is her first solo venture.

1998-12-27	Not Every Treat Is Chocolate-Covered	THE other day, a gastronomic crisis arose in Matt Magyar's Third Avenue Chocolate Shoppe, a sweet-smelling place tucked in among the row of eateries and shops along Spring Lake's business district. Inside the confectioner's display case sat the last two remaining Chicken Leggs, Mr. Magyar's signature concoction, which consists of a salty pretzel stick dipped in caramel, rolled in peanuts and covered with chocolate. On the other side of the glass stood three hungry little girls. And me.
1998-12-25	Chase-American Express Dispute Settled	The Chase Manhattan Corporation said yesterday that it had reached a settlement with the American Express Company, two days after the charge card giant filed a lawsuit in Federal court in New York contending that Chase used false advertising and deceptive acts in marketing its platinum credit cards. The terms of the settlement are confidential and no further information is available, a Chase spokesman, Ken Herz, said.
1998-12-15	First USA and GE Capital in Card Deal	First USA said today that it had bought $2.2 billion of Visa and Mastercard receivables from the GE Capital Services Corporation, making it the largest United States credit-card issuer while allowing GE Capital to exit the business. The companies also said they had formed a joint venture for private-label credit cards. GE Capital, a unit of the General Electric Company, will contribute $1 billion of its private-label card accounts for retailers like Macy's and Home Depot. First USA, a division of the Bank One Corporation, will contribute $1.6 billion in receivables for companies like the Sony Corporation and leave the private-label business.
1998-12-15	The real winners in electronic commerce are turning out to be the credit-card companies.	IN many an Internet start-up company's dreams, there's a fragment of hope that its Web site, device or software will somehow stand at the tollbooth of the electronic commerce universe and collect a share of every transaction made in cyberspace. That device has already arrived. It's called the credit card.
1998-12-13	A Mexican Atmosphere in Port Chester	THE festive decor at Mary Ann's in Westchester is alone worth the price of admission. Giant ceramic cactuses flank the entrance; a Mayan-style figure guards an indoor fountain. Brilliant blues, yellows and terra cottas color the walls, or what one can see of them under all the Mexican crafts that cram the place -- pierced-tin lighting fixtures, tiled table tops and ceramic masks, candle lamps and all sorts of ornamental sculptures. Wherever one looks, something interesting catches the eye. So what if this restaurant is part of a chain -- Manhattan has several of them -- and so what if the menu lists more than 60 entrees, making it unlikely that every one will be acceptable. In fact, chicken was dry with overcooking, and some dishes proved much too salty, to mention two lapses. But by choosing carefully, one can have a decent meal here.
1998-12-13	Whose Numbers to Use On Credit Card Debt?	Earlier this year, when the credit card industry lobbied Congress to toughen bankruptcy laws for individuals, Visa USA and Mastercard International commissioned a study that said 10 percent of debtors could repay some card debt. Legislation, passed by the House but not taken up in the Senate, would have required a single person making $17,900 or more, or a family of four making $51,000 or more, to repay 30 percent of credit card debts in bankruptcy. If the debtor failed, he risked being pursued for the rest of his life for the full debt and penalties.

More elegant than most of its neighboring restaurants in the Belmont section, Amici's has a large menu of traditional southern Italian dishes. Cold appetizers include pimento and anchovies and scungilli-and-calamari salad. The pastas include three kinds of ravioli, angel-hair with fresh vegetables, gnocchi in Bolognese sauce, spaghetti carbonara, meat or cheese tortellini, and linguini with fresh clams, shrimp and a touch of plum tomato. Zuppa di pesce, red snapper and Chilean bass top the seafood list. One of the special chicken dishes is a pounded breast stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella, served with mushrooms. And of course the ubiquitous veal, served nine ways, including Montebianco: with prosciutto, artichoke hearts and mozzarella in a white wine sauce. To end the meal there are homemade New York- or Italian-style cheescake, pignoli nut pie, amoretto torte, and occasionally zabaglione or chocolate-covered strawberries.

Within this storefront operation, an artist -- Charles Gabriel -- is at work. His fried chicken is magnificent, the delicious meat concealed within a crisp, nutty crust. Pork chops as well as the chicken are smothered in a peppery milk-and-onion gravy that complements the meat perfectly. Pork ribs and the oxtail in an oniony brown gravy are sweet and tender. Desserts may include peach cobbler full of nutmeg and cinnamon, and coconut cake with pineapple jam between the layers. Mr. Gabriel prepares only a few dishes each day, and there is no predicting what will be on the menu. ($25 and Under: 5/23/97)
1998-11-12	America's Turn to Colonize; Credit Card Issuers Invade Britain, With U.S. Firepower	What, precisely, is Billy Connolly, the Scottish comedian, doing in biblical robes and beard in a commercial with floating goldfish that fill the television screen? Improbably, the answer lies in a remarkable American invasion of the credit card industry in Britain that has left big British credit card issuers smarting. For the goldfish represent the Goldfish card, which has gained 800,000 customers since it was first issued in 1996 by a British subsidiary of Household International Inc. of Prospect Heights, Ill., in conjunction with a British gas utility.
1998-11-11	The Gift Is in the Mail, Savory and Sweet	AFTER 17 years of tasting and testing mail-order food for the holidays, I think I have gotten choosing favorites down to something of a science. This year, more than 100 items arrived at my house (none were ordered under my own name). To make it into the finals, the food had to arrive when promised, be fresh, and intact. Of course, it had to taste great.

1998-11-11	Fraud Is Rare, But Check The Tab Anyway	LAST week, when a well-known New York chef was charged with falsifying the tips on receipts submitted to credit card companies, an alarm might have sounded for diners who don't think twice about the precise amount scrawled on the bottom of the bill. Some might even admit that, after a few glasses of wine and a couple hours of conviviality, they barely think once about it. And there are probably few who could say that, weeks later, they check their receipts against their billing statements.

1998-10-29	Mastercard joins the growing crowd that believes what sells here will sell there, too.	THEODORE LEVITT may or may not pay for anything with a Mastercard, but he can certainly use the company to prove his theories of global marketing. In 1983, Mr. Levitt, a marketing expert at the Harvard Business School, popularized the idea of the global village in marketing. He wrote that advances in technology and communications were shrinking the planet, encouraging consumers everywhere to develop similar tastes for the same products. With few notable exceptions, most people ignored his theories, continuing to believe that what sold in the United States would not necessarily sell in Japan, France or Latin America.
1998-10-28	Microsoft Deal For Banc One	The Microsoft Corporation has signed a five-year, $90 million agreement with the First USA unit of the Banc One Corporation that is being described as the largest such deal involving Internet advertising.

Banner ads and other on-line displays asking computer users to apply for Visa and Mastercard credit cards issued by First USA are to appear on MSN properties like MSNBC, Hotmail, Carpoint and Expedia.
1998-10-25	Sushi and Tempura, With Lots of Decor	JAPANESE cooking has never gotten the attention some other Asian cuisines have. Yet it is still an occasion when a Japanese restaurant opens, as the arrival of Little Tokyo in Norwalk indicates. Although the storefront space is limited, there is a sense of a real Tokyo sushi bar, through the use of wood lattices and shoji screens over windows (to shut out parking lot views) and big red paper globes hanging from the ceiling. The sushi bar is in the rear.

Highly recommended are main courses of feijoada, Brazil's famous meaty black bean stew; camarao na moranga, tiny, tender rock shrimp sauteed with fresh corn, hearts of palm, shallots, peas and coconut milk, blended with cheese and baked in an acorn squash; and picadinho, or small chunks of beef sauteed with wine and thyme, topped with a poached egg and served with traditional accompaniments of rice, beans and cooked bananas.

Typical of their style are starters like mixed greens tossed in a black olive and blood orange citrus dressing, and warm marinated portobellos with grilled polenta, arugula and stracchino cheese.

1998-10-11	Serious About Barbecue, and Clean, Too	THE Cookhouse, a big red barn along Route 7 in New Milford, is doubly pleasing. Not only are the ribs slow-smoked and as tasty as can be, but the premises are meticulously clean, neat and tidy. Even the gritty school enthusiasts in our group, who feel the best barbecue can only be found in grungy, down-and-dirty joints. agreed that in this case cleanliness did not preclude tastiness. On one visit, we decided to wake up our palates with a shared starter of smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla. It turned out to be a wise choice, large enough for two. Though the mixture, of melted pepper jack cheese, smoky chicken bits, beans and chopped onions was a bit too gooey, the combination was a good one, expanded by a spicy tomato-onion salsa and dabs of lime-accented sour cream.
1998-10-09	Competition for Credit Cards	Americans are bombarded constantly by telephone and mail solicitations for credit cards, offering all sorts of incentives to apply. So it may be hard for many to believe that Visa and Mastercard, which dominate the field, are guilty of restricting the choices for consumers, as the Justice Department charged in an antitrust suit filed this week. But the department has marshaled impressive evidence that these two credit card companies have conspired to stifle competition between themselves and keep other competitors out. In the 1960's, when the credit card phenomenon got under way, each bank offered either Visa or Mastercard. But in the years since, banks have generally offered both on the same terms. The core of the antitrust argument is that because Visa and Mastercard are both effectively owned by the same large alliances of banks, they have little incentive to improve services and win customers away from each other, since doing so would simply siphon profits from one network into the other.
1998-10-08	Antitrust Suit Filed Against Visa and Mastercard	The Government filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa USA and Mastercard International yesterday, contending the nation's two biggest credit card networks restrain competition and limit consumers' choices. The lawsuit, filed by the Justice Department in Manhattan Federal court, challenges the control of both credit card assocations by the same set of banks, as well as the rules adopted by Visa and Mastercard that ban member banks from offering credit cards of competitors like American Express and Discover.

The agreement was reached without the consent of Congressional Democrats or the White House, and Administration officials said they would recommend that President Clinton veto the bill because of its treatment of low-income consumers.

1998-10-04	Narrowing the Bankruptcy Escape Hatch	CONGRESS is about to make it a whole lot harder for many Americans to walk away from their debts. And, depending on whom you talk to, that will either throw untold numbers of people into lifelong economic bondage in the next recession or teach them a much-needed lesson in financial responsibility. Under current law, people who get in over their heads can get a fresh start by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, wiping out all their debts except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support, alimony and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work. Such filings are made by hundreds of thousands of people each year.

1998-09-13	Editorial Observer; As Team Prices Soar, Only Media Can Buy	The attention of American sports fans has been centered on the breaking of Roger Maris's home run record. But there is another record in the world of sports that is being broken by much greater margins than Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa can hope to achieve. That is the record price for a sports franchise. Until last week, the peak price was $311 million, paid earlier this year for the Los Angeles Dodgers by a company controlled by Rupert Murdoch. Then Alfred Lerner, who became rich through credit cards, paid $530 million for the Cleveland Browns expansion football team. The very next day, a company controlled by Mr. Murdoch offered $1 billion for the Manchester United soccer team in England.

1998-09-09	McDougal's Trial Begins With Chronicle of Finances	After months of delay, opening arguments began here today in the embezzlement trial of Susan H. McDougal, with a prosecutor telling jurors that President Clinton's onetime partner in the Whitewater deal stole more than $150,000 from the conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife in a ''crime of passion'' born of frustration at her financial reverses in Arkansas. For years with her former husband, the late James B. McDougal, Ms. McDougal ''became accustomed to having lots of money, spending lots of money and living a very high style of life,'' the prosecutor, Jeffrey Semow, said. But with her marriage over and the couple's finances ruined, she took a job in 1989 as assistant and later bookkeeper to Nancy Mehta, and ''even though that money had run out, the passion for it still survived,'' Mr. Semow added.

If available, consider beginning your meal with the addictive little whitebait, dipped in flour and lightly fried whole; or choose a selection of the traditional dips and spreads like taramosalata, the lemony fish-roe puree, or tzatziki, the cool mixture of yogurt, cucumber and mint. For main courses, you can't go wrong with virtually any charcoal-grilled fish ranging from red snapper and striped bass to porgy, flounder, swordfish and more.

No matter how much he spends, though, his Visa and Mastercard issuers keep automatically raising his authorized credit limits, which now run well into five figures each. The idea, of course, is to tempt people like Mr. Thomsen -- a customer with a good payment record -- to borrow ever-higher amounts at interest rates that often approach 20 percent. But for some consumers, it also means a chance to get into ever-bigger financial trouble.

This Chinese restaurant is one of three New York offshoots of a popular restaurant chain in China, and it is worth seeking out for its fresh and deftly prepared Sichuan cooking. Recommended are dishes of cold noodles in a zesty, nutty and sweet sesame sauce; sliced conch coated with spicy red oil; seafood and asparagus dumplings served with a soy-vinegar dipping sauce; and shredded tea-smoked duck with ginger. Other highlights include the double-cooked fresh bacon (which has been both simmered and braised and resembles Canadian bacon) served in a chili sauce; and cubed bean curd cooked in a potent sauce made with caramelized garlic, ginger, minced pork and pepper.

1998-07-27	A Test in Cashless Spending Turns Out to Be a Hard Sell	It has been 10 months since four of the nation's leading financial institutions rolled out a brave new way to buy stuff on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, issuing so-called smart cards that promised a futuristic glimpse of a cashless society. But the Upper West Side, chosen because of the spending habits of its affluent and with-it residents, seems to want to remain in the present for a while longer.

D'Amato said tonight that he planned to attach a proposal to cut automated-teller fees to a bill that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy code. The bill would prevent banks from double-charging customers who use money machines at banks that are not their own. Most customers who use money machines at banks that are not their own are charged $1.50 on top of the $1 they are already charged for processing the withdrawal.
1998-07-22	$25 AND UNDER; Via Flushing to Dumplings, Eels and Old Shanghai	I WOULDN'T call myself desperate to find good Chinese restaurants: I'm just extremely eager. So when I received an effusive letter from a reader about Shanghai Tang, a new restaurant in Flushing, Queens, I was on my way. Shanghai-style restaurants seem inherently appealing to Americans, possibly because of steamed xiao long bao, better known as soup dumplings: plump, pleated packets that spurt hot soup when bitten into. Shanghai Tang, a bright, handsome restaurant decorated with black-and-white photographs of old Shanghai, makes a fine version, identified on the menu as crab-meat-and-pork juicy buns ($5.95).

1998-07-19	The Ups and Downs of a Return Visit	WHEN we heard that Spazzi, in Fairfield, had a new owner and new chef, we decided the time was right for a return visit. It was eight years since the restaurant had opened and changes seemed likely. The decor is much the same but one difference was evident the moment we entered: Instead of an uptight, indifferent staff -- which we remembered all too well -- current staff members were solicitous and extremely upbeat. The menu has slimmed down considerably and now features pizza and pasta, with just four main plates (salmon, chicken, filet mignon and loin of veal) and several specials.
1998-07-12	In Port Chester, Italian Fare With Flair	MAIN STREET here is a boulevard of endless choices, luring diners from throughout the county and across state lines. In addition, tucked into this village's narrower streets are kitchens with modest ambitions, neighborhood pleasers, which the passer-by might also keep in mind. The hot spot of the moment, however, is Piero's. At prime dining time, crowds jam the tiny entryway and spill onto the sidewalk where a couple of considerately placed benches make waiting more comfortable. As usual with such out-of-the-way, unprepossessing places, there are good reasons for their popularity.
1998-07-12	Low-Key Bidding for State-Sponsored Credit Card Raises Questions	In late 1995, the Pataki administration, looking for innovative ways for the state to promote and profit from its image, decided to sponsor an ''I Love New York'' credit card. The idea was to sell the rights to the slogan to a bank, which would emblazon it on a standard Visa card or Mastercard along with pictures of scenic New York. The contract went to the MBNA Corporation of Delaware, a large credit card issuer that in the last four years has been one of the biggest political contributors to the New York Republican State Committee and to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.

1998-07-05	Names to Note On Amsterdam	ALOUETTE + (212) 222-6808; 2588 Broadway, near 97th Street; $; no smoking; all major credit cards. With a solid kitchen team headed by Daniel Angerer, a talented young chef who earned his culinary stripes at Bouley Bakery, Jean-Georges and Joel Robuchon in Paris, it is easy to under the instant popularity of this fairly recent Gallic spot. The enticing menu features starters of freshly shucked oysters with a Champagne vinaigrette; young garlic soup holding foie gras ravioli, and a Provencale terrine of layered eggplant, bell peppers and creamy goat cheese. For entrees, there are pan-roasted flounder finished with a citrus-caper sauce and ganished with steamed new potatoes; seared duck breast accompanied by creamy rutabaga, mashed potatoes and roasted beets, and roast tuna in a pastry crust, ringed by a tangy green pea sauce and served with savoy cabbage.

1998-06-28	French and Fusion Influences in Bedford	LONG a major road in the leafier parts of the county, Route 22 provides some bonny sights as it wends through this town, although traffic can make skylarking a bit tricky. If one chooses to leave the line of frantic hasteners-toward-home, Bistro Twenty-Two offers tranquillity and elegance, just as it has for two decades. The name remains from the restaurant's early days when David Fehr, the owner, ran it as a bistro where, in a noisy, crowded room done in red vinyl and bad paneling diners could be served onion soup topped with Gruyere, escargots, coquilles and coupe de marrons.

From the simple elegance of the small, cozy dining room to the gentle service, refined cuisine and excellent wine list, Bouley Bakery is one of the loveliest restaurants on this side of town. Current appetizers include lump crab meat and crisp asparagus in parsley vinaigrette; goat cheese and grilled eggplant terrine enhanced by fresh tomatoes and sweet peppers, and French string bean and yellow frisee salad tossed in a pistachio dressing. For main courses, there are seared duck breast in honey glaze, garnished with a medley of baby watercress, pears and wheat berries; pan-roasted salmon complemented by a fricassee of wild mushrooms and buttery fava beans; roast chicken au jus flanked by a silky potato puree and stewed root vegetables, and lobster served with marjoram sauce with fresh corn and sweet peas.

1998-06-17	Restaurants; Proof That the Thin Do, in Fact, Eat	IF you are over 30, weigh more than 105 pounds, favor bright colors or bite your fingernails, Bond Street could do you damage. No matter how confident you may be in the real world, it is hard to face an entire universe of thin, young, beautiful people dressed in black without wondering what you are doing there. Especially when you watch their chopsticks flash through the perfumed air to pick up bits of ''hot eel dice.'' But once you get past the sheer fabulousness of the crowd, the attitude at the door and the cool glamour of the small dining room, you discover a surprising sweetness. Bond Street is an earnest Nobu emulator, and the waiters describe the inventive Japanese dishes with painstaking care. They can also elaborate upon the various sakes on the list. One overly enthusiastic waiter even blushed when I raised an eyebrow at his mention of ''organic foie gras.'' ''Oh, of course not,'' he corrected himself. ''I'm just used to working at Bouley, where so much of the menu is organic.''

Coming at a time when credit-card lending is among the most profitable sectors of an intensely competitive banking industry that has little room for growth, the legislation has prompted the credit-card and banking businesses to spend millions of dollars to push the bill.
1998-05-31	Down-Home Southern Treats and Caviar	CORNBREAD and Caviar is both the name of a new Baldwin restaurant and a description of the first bites of a meal there. Warm, crumblely squares of cornbread, paired with caviar-dotted butter, create a positive first impression. The two foods are also symbols. The cornbread stands for all the down-home Southern treats on the menu: fried catfish, barbecue ribs, collard greens, sweet potatoes, fried chicken. The caviar hints at more than that. This is not a soul-food storefront, but a place with valet parking, white tablecloths and candlelight.

This vibrant glass-walled restaurant delivers an alluring roster of spirited pastas, sprightly salads and roast entrees in an upbeat atmosphere. Service is accommodating and prices are moderate. You might begin with the brightly seasoned salad of radicchio and baby spinach salad with pancetta, crispy walnuts and crumbled Gorgonzola cheese in a sweet balsamic vinaigrette; or the handsome montage of marinated tomatoes, thickly sliced and layered with fresh mozzarella and basil leaves. Pastas are generally right on the mark, including the earthy cavatelli tossed with broccoli, roasted garlic specks and a shot of red pepper; or the gigli assembled with chunky fennel sausage and broccoli rabe in a creamed white bean sauce redolent of garlic. There are entrees of pan-roasted red snapper with walnut pesto and rack of lamb au jus with grilled eggplant and a white bean ragout. (Review: 9/13/91; revisited: 1/23/97)
1998-05-31	What X Marks	IT'S difficult to reserve a table at Restaurant X for a Saturday night, and for obvious reasons. The food is often wonderful, and the warren of dining rooms, including a beautiful bar where you can order anything from a spoonful of caviar to a root beer float, is flawlessly designed. The profusion of fresh flowers alone is worth the extra phone call it takes to secure a table. Not surprisingly, Restaurant X is the brainchild of Peter Xaviar Kelly, the Wunderkind who opened Xaviar's in Garrison, N.Y., when he was 23, followed by Xaviar's and Freelance in Piermont, N.Y. The good news for Xaviar fans is that Restaurant X combines the high level of cooking at Mr. Kelly's more formal restaurants with the fun and whimsy of Freelance, his less formal cafe. In addition, Congers, in Rockland County, is only 15 minutes from North Jersey and a convenient stop between vacation spots like the Berkshires and the rest of the Garden State.

Just north of the Holland Tunnel is this romantic out-of-the-way little place with beguiling food. For starters, there is a soup of roasted squash finished with pumpkin seed oil and garnished with pumpkin seed tuiles; goat cheese and potato napoleon with braised oyster mushrooms in a citrus jus, or poached oysters served warm with braised leeks in a slightly tart apple and calvados cream. Entrees include pan-roasted salmon complemented by fennel and crab meat; roast chicken accompanied by wild rice augmented by black currants, scallions and toasted almonds, and roasted quail stuffed with a mixture of escarole and ricotta cheese and set over sauteed potatoes scented with parsley and garlic.

Sprightly seafood is a steady lure at this winsome SoHo landing. An open terrace, gracious staff and reasonable prices greatly add to the appeal. A selection of oysters on the half shell are a fine way to start -- the raw bar features more than 20 kinds. For appetizers, there is lobster and avocado salad in a grapefruit-Champagne dressing, and peppered tuna carpaccio with roasted Bermuda onions under a drizzle of lemon. Choices among entrees include bouillabaisse with red snapper, mussels, shrimp, scallops and lobster in a saffron-perfumed tomato broth; seared sea scallops in lobster broth, garnished with Dungeness crab polenta and fava beans, and pan-roasted cod enhanced by a basil-tomato emulsion and paired with Littleneck risotto perfumed with saffron. (Review: 5/10/96) BAROLO ** [rating: two stars] (212) 226-1102, 398 West Broadway, near Spring Street; $$$; cigarette and cigar smoking in bar and garden areas; all major credit cards. Far from the street fumes and noise, an enchanting outdoor garden with spotlighted trees and terra cotta floors can be found at this stylish and comfortable northern Italian spot. For openers, there are grilled vegetables with smoked mozzarella, and mixed lettuces tossed in balsamic vinaigrette. Pastas are generally right on the mark whether penne blended with a ragout of lamb and artichokes; baked vegetable lasagna; fresh fettuccine tossed in olive oil, garlic with shrimp and zucchini; or rigatoni mixed with eggplant, tomato, basil and ricotta cheese. Entrees include grilled salmon with honey-mustard sauce; pounded and breaded veal chop topped with arugula and chopped tomatoes, and filet mignon in Barolo wine sauce. (Review: 1/14/94) FRONTIERE * [rating: one star] (212) 387-0898; 199 Prince Street, at Macdougal Street; $$; cigarette smoking at the bar; all major credit cards. Frontiere's intimate dining room is the perfect match for the enticing roster of rustic French-American dishes. You might begin with leek-and-bacon tart topped with crumbled Roquefort cheese; roasted eggplant soup with red pepper aioli, or lusty wild mushroom salad with warm potatoes and goat cheese. Among the main courses are grilled marinated baby chicken scented with garlic, rosemary and lemon and served with gnocchi; barbecued salmon with tomato salsa and a pairing of grilled asparagus; grilled lamb chops with a rosemary jus and a stack of french fries; and pan-roasted sea scallops in saffron sauce with a medley of spring vegetables.

Mediterranean and American flavors are fused in a compelling way in Katy Sparks's kitchen. For starters on the current menu, roasted beets, string beans and walnut are tossed into a salad with a lemon-black pepper aioli; a silky asparagus soup is enhanced by a small scoop of saffron-lime-flavored creme fraiche; octopus is grilled and set over warm golden potatoes, pickled onions and olives; and black mussels are roasted and served in a garlicky almond-and-thyme butter. Typical entrees include braised rabbit with morel mushrooms, potatoes, fava beans and caramelized onions; grilled tuna steak with papaya-ginger relish paired with french fries; and grilled tenderloin of pork in rhubarb glaze accompanied by sauteed shiitakes and fennel and walnuts braised in red wine. (Review: 1/31/97) RICE + (212) 226-5775; 227 Mott Street, near Prince Street; $; smoking restaurant; no credit cards. Flavorful rice dishes, prompt and pleasant service and inexpensive prices are a winning formula at this compact, sleek brick-and-metal combination restaurant-takeout shop. The small metal tables are simply appointed with bowls and chopsticks. Each of the 10 main selections listed on the menu come with a choice of rice, of which there are four kinds. Recommendations include the nutty, long-grain basmati rice, topped with sensational black beans in tomato sauce or with the well-spiced Indian chicken curry. Thai black rice goes well with both chicken satay in a luscious peanut sauce, and the Thai beef salad. Japanese rice is a good match for the refreshing Vietnamese chicken salad with lemongrass. ($25 and Under: 8/1/97) SOHO STEAK + (212) 226-0602; 90 Thompson Street, near Spring Street; $; no smoking; no credit cards. Creative cooking at bargain prices and in a gregarious atmosphere is what this amiable bistro delivers. The emphasis is on meat and a good way to begin might be with braised oxtail raviolo with shiitake mushrooms, tomatoes and potato; grilled foie gras served over creamy polenta, or sauteed sweetbreads, spiced with clove and assembled with grilled eggplant, roasted peppers and mache. Entrees include grilled hanger steak in shallot-red-wine sauce with potato and goat cheese gratin; roast leg of lamb with tarragon-infused natural juices; and grilled sirloin with caramelized onions and french fries. SoHo Steak offers an appealing brunch menu on weekends ranging from goat cheese, grilled tomato and fresh herbs omelet to duck confit salad with fennel and couscous grain, and steak tartare with capers, chives and fries. ($25 and Under: 4/5/96) CANAL HOUSE ** [rating: two stars] (212) 965-3588; 310 West Broadway, near Canal Street; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards. A comfortable setting, accommodating staff and engaging home-style cooking make this winsome restaurant in the SoHo Grand Hotel a fine option for casual dining. A small menu offers appetizers of asparagus and roasted beet vinaigrette; onion soup under a lid of Swiss cheese, and fried oysters served with braised leeks in a lemon-butter sauce enriched with caviar. There are main courses of roast chicken with garlic-laced mashed potatoes; seared sea bass with shallots and a wild mushroom fricassee; grilled salmon paired with a rock shrimp and potato hash; lamb chops accompanied by a ragout of fava beans and morel mushrooms, and seared New York steak with a crispy stack of fries.

1998-05-10	The Most Important Meal of the Day	BIG-DEAL restaurants in New Jersey concentrate on dinner, but little-deal restaurants reserve their energy for lunch. Some of these cafes and cubbyholes are so tiny that they might never attract attention but for a neighbor who raves about them. Two that currently lure me from my computer at lunchtime also sell goodies to go, which makes a drive even more worthwhile. One of these, Bon Appetit in Mahwah, serves just what you want to eat for lunch, whether the office or an hourlong nap awaits you: great soup, first-rate quiches and pastries, and chocolates that find their way into many of the best hotel dining rooms in New Jersey.

In the world of credit cards, though, the Banc One deal is the headliner. Credit cards have been a major profit center at First Chicago for years and Banc One vaulted to prominence in the business last year with its acquisition of First USA. The new Banc One, which will have its headquarters here, will combine the nation's third- and fifth-largest credit card portfolios.

A good omen greeted us on arrival: oven-hot herbed rolls, served with olive oil infused with rosemary and red pepper pods, along with huge green olives rolled in toasted garlic bits. A few minutes later, warm crusty bread arrived. An Italian-style sandwich (toasted bread with layers of prosciutto, eggplant and tomato crowned with melted mozzarella) and chicken breasts sauteed with scallions, garlic, rosemary and lots of fresh mushrooms in a tantalizing light brown sauce sparked by balsamic vinegar were both delicious.

1998-03-01	The Little Creepy Crawlers Who Will Eat You In The Night	There are two parts to this story, and the first, like most things in Silicon Valley, can be dispensed with quickly. It runs something like this: In the 1960's and 70's, the Santa Clara Valley got itself a new name by making silicon chips, personal computers and related goods. The sunshine, the absence of tradition, the willingness of Stanford University to do business with corporations and the presence of a counterculture intent on arming the masses with new technology all made the Valley the place to be for people with a knack for building new machines. Other things being equal, the new will arise where the old simply does not exist. Soon, enough other things were not at all equal. It turned out that the market for engineers in Silicon Valley did not obey the old economic rules. Each new engineer who migrated into the Valley was not less but more valuable than the one before him. As engineers trickled in, they created even bigger opportunities for even more engineers. The rewards for quitting your job at Bell Labs or I.B.M., packing the wife and kids into the station wagon and driving across country to Paradise grew and grew. A trickle of engineers became a stream; the stream became a river; the river became a torrent.
1998-02-26	Can You Spare a Dime? Click Yes.	RICH SCHMIDT did not see much point in posting a personal Web page that listed, say, the contents of his CD collection. ''No one would care,'' he said. But then he hit on an idea that might get attention and address a rather persistent lack of disposable income: ask strangers for money. The result, the Amazing ''Send Me a Dollar'' Website (tt.net/send-me-a-dollar/), is an example of a very old profession updated for the Web. The virtual beggar has arrived. For indisputable proof, check the Net's most popular directory, Yahoo, which has created a spot in its taxonomy called Begging for Money under ''Humor, Jokes and Fun.'' That may seem unkind, but Yahoo has put its finger on the central paradox of on-line begging. In real life, panhandling depends on personal contact; on the Web, mendicant sites are quite easy to avoid. They must, therefore, entertain to attract visitors.

One night I am eating Mauritius-style lamb with caramelized quince, exclaiming over the freshness of the spices, the beautifully pointed flavors, savoring every bite. One week later, eating the same dish, I find myself searching desperately for something, anything, to like about the dull, pallid stew. What is going on? Perhaps it was the presence of the restaurant's consultant, Ismail Merchant, the producer of films and cookbooks, that made the difference. But no, Mr. Merchant was there on both nights, playing host to large parties of seemingly happy guests. If he was displeased with the food on the second evening, he did not show it.

When the checks come in, ''there's $4,000 or so in the bank,'' she said. But after the bill-paying sessions, ''there's only $100.''

1998-01-07	Business Travel; Despite the season, there are still some bargain air fares to several warm weather destinations.	AIRPLANES traditionally have fewer passengers in winter, except on flights to warm weather destinations, so a number of carriers are trying to lure passengers by offering bargain fares to Europe. But this year some carriers are also offering bargains to sun spots in Florida, the Caribbean and Latin America. Continental Airlines, for example, is offering round trips between New York/Newark and Milwaukee for $184; Lima, Peru for $496, and Mexico City for $296. For $298, passengers can fly round trip to Paris, Frankfurt, Lisbon or Madrid. Round trip to London, Birmingham, or Manchester in England is $198. Tickets must be purchased no later than Jan. 22, and travel completed by April 30. (Travel to Europe must be completed by April 5.)
1998-01-07	Restaurants; Sushi for Novices, Without Loss of Face	''PLEASE don't embarrass me. Promise that you'll eat everything, even if it seems weird. Don't forget to buy the sushi chef a drink. And if he offers you the salmon skin, be sure to express your undying gratitude.'' My first encounter with sushi, 30 years ago, made me feel as if I were being inducted into a secret society. The man who took me to that first meal had spent many years cultivating a sushi chef, and he was worried that I would ruin the relationship. As we drove to the restaurant, he briefed me on the ritual. By the time he was done, I was terrified: there were so many rules!

1997-12-28	Another Year Of Mad Bulls And Big Gaffes	It was a year in which the bulls again emerged triumphant -- at least in this country. Asia was another matter, with tiger economies looking toothless as their profligate governments denounced hedge fund operators for having the nerve to bet that overvalued currencies would decline. It was a year in which House Republicans almost got rid of their Speaker, and House Democrats abandoned their President on trade. It was a year in which many deserved awards, but only a few can get them. Here are some of the winners for 1997. The rest are on page 8. GARY HART CHALLENGE AWARD To Bill Clinton, for responding to allegations of campaign finance irregularities by proclaiming: ''I don't believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.''
1997-12-25	Of Family, and an Improbable Road to Parenthood	In David Ogrin's household, babies and birdies are always welcome. As a veteran on the PGA Tour, and as a father of four, Ogrin reads bedtime stories as well as he reads putts. This year, Ogrin set a career-best mark for season earnings ($593,683), had seven top 10 finishes, finished 36th on the money list and thoroughly enjoyed playing the best golf of his life at age 39.
1997-12-21	From Xavier's, Classic Fare in Congers	X MARKS the spot, in fact the entrance to this welcome new Rockland County restaurant once occupied by the Bully Boy. X also stands for Xaviar, as in Peter Xaviar Kelly, the brilliant chef now embarking on this, his fourth -- but first large-scale -- venture (Xaviar's in Garrison, Xaviar's in Piermont and the Freelance Cafe and Wine Bar are his others). With his usual attention to detail, he has engaged Glenn Vogt, the best front-of-the house manager in the business, to oversee the dining rooms. Add beautifully appointed, comfortable dining rooms -- some with fireplace, some with long views -- gorgeous bouquets, soft lighting, young but seamless service, and the combination is dynamite.
1997-12-17	Restaurants; Burned Menu. Weird Shrimp. It's a Party!	YOU won't eat well at Asia de Cuba. But you will have so much fun being there that you may not notice. The manic energy of the place makes every night feel like a party. ''Think nothing of it,'' our waiter says when a menu goes up in flames. He shoves a few of the votive lights aside, adding: ''It happens all the time. Last week a waiter caught fire!'' Chuckling softly at the memory, he sets our drinks down on the table. We have all foolishly ordered Tiki Puka Puka, a potent mixture of rums, Cointreau and various tropical juices decorated with plastic palms and paper umbrellas and large enough to put an edge on the evening for at least two people.

1997-12-14	Fit for a Fiesta	YOU don't want to dip too many chips in too much salsa at Casa del Sol, a revelrous Mexican restaurant in downtown Nyack, but the kick of the bright, cilantro-flavored sauce might seduce you. What is it about Mexican restaurants that encourages a party? The location of Casa del Sol is one factor. Main Street in Nyack is like a suburban Greenwich Village, offering pottery, wheat grass and independent films. Parking is difficult, and dining out on weekends inevitably means a line. But inside the restaurant, live music and well-made margaritas lessen the pain of waiting. If you can grab a chair or at least chips from the bar, you might even regard it as a pleasant part of the evening.

1997-11-24	New Security System for Internet Purchases Has Its Doubters	After two years of development and dozens of trials around the world, the credit card industry is readying an elaborate system meant to improve the security of making purchases over the Internet. The system, called Secure Electronic Transaction, is to be introduced early next year and promises to make it harder for someone to steal a credit card number sent over the Internet. It will also make it easier for shoppers to verify that the on-line merchants they are dealing with are legitimate and for the merchants to authenticate the identity of the shoppers.
1997-11-24	White House May Tighten Data Exports	The Clinton Administration is debating whether to further tighten controls on the export of electronic data scrambling systems by narrowing a special exemption that has let financial institutions export the strongest encryption technology.

1997-11-23	Mediterranean Family Fare in Armonk	THE hand-painted grapevine edging the walls and the new color scheme of dark leaf green and burgundy tints freshen dining rooms once called Maddalena but now known as the Grapevine. Along with the name, the owners Gino Izetta, the chef, and Janis Pettit changed the menu and focus. The name, Mr. Izetta said, was inspired by the many grapevines that grow around the Mediterranean, and the change in menu resulted from his interest in branching out into that cuisine. The Grapevine has also reoriented itself to serve families, which, in recent years, have flocked to the neighborhood, fulfilling a need for a viable alternative to fast-food purveyors. Indeed, on one of our visits we counted as many children as adults (perhaps the reason for the glass-topped tables). Children under 10 can have orecchiete (ear-shaped pasta) with tomato sauce, a mini-pizza with mozzarella, morsels of chicken roasted on a stick and a fistful of shoestring fried potatoes for $5 while adults enjoy more substantial fare.

1997-11-12	Restaurants; Hamptons Hot Spot Has a City Cottage	SOME restaurants fit so perfectly into their neighborhoods that it is almost impossible to imagine a time when they were not there. Payard Patisserie and Bistro, to take one recent example, is only a couple of months old, but it is already hard to remember where the Upper East Side ladies lunched before it opened. Nick & Toni's Cafe is its mirror image: although it has a completely different atmosphere, the five-month-old restaurant fits so seamlessly into the low-key streets of the Upper West Side that it seems to have been there forever. Which is surprising: Who would have expected that an offshoot of the hottest place in the Hamptons would play so well just off Columbus Avenue? But the owners, Jeff Salway and Toni Ross, have used the slight scruffiness of their small West 67th Street outpost to good advantage. It is resolutely not hip, not chic, not terribly trendy. It seems more a place to drop into for a bite than a reservation restaurant, and only a very discerning eye will notice that the details are impeccable: the copper-topped bar, bucolic murals and wood-burning oven near the door give the room a cozy air.

1997-11-02	Cheers, With Food	GIUSEPPE'S is the kind of place my father loved, a restaurant above a bar. It's the kind of place where you'd never find women like my mother. The appeal these rooms held for my father -- who loved my mother but didn't share her taste in restaurants -- centered on the food, which was always better expected, and the prices, which were ridiculously low. At Giuseppe's, for example, a lunch of chicken-and-rice soup, fillet of sole with artichoke hearts, and homemade apple strudel is $6.95.
1997-11-02	Having a Go at Noodle Dishes From Asia	TUCKED discreetly into the small Nayaug Shopping Center in South Glastonbury is Char Koon. The name means teahouse, and the petite space (only 10 tables) is just about teahouse size. But Char Koon -- more noodle house than teahouse -- makes up for its size in the variety of dishes on its menu.

1997-10-22	A Banking Powerhouse of Cards; MBNA Continues to Build on Its Foundation of Plastic	Charles M. Cawley has long seen gold where others see lead, mining the overlooked business opportunity to the hilt and making it pay off handsomely. Take, appropriately enough, the gold credit card, which despite its hue left many bankers cold. In 1983, when he was head of the small credit card unit of the Maryland National Bank, Mr. Cawley pounced on the new Gold Mastercard, becoming the top issuer of a product that other banks had chosen to ignore. He repeated the feat last year as head of the now-independent unit, renamed the MBNA Corporation and based here, when he introduced the first major bank-issued platinum card.
1997-10-22	Mastercard hopes to become the credit card of choice for ordinary, middle-class consumers.	MASTERCARD is trying to carve out a niche in the crowded field of credit and charge card marketers, with an emotional campaign, starting tonight, that emphasizes its image as the card for ordinary, middle-class consumers. The theme of the campaign is: ''There are some things money can't buy . . . for everything else there's Mastercard.'' The goal of the campaign is to forge a warm bond between consumers and Mastercard, while differentiating Mastercard from its competitors like Visa, American Express and Discover.

1997-10-19	A Chip of Things to Come?	WHEN Citibank, Chase, Mastercard and Visa introduced a new money chip on the Upper West Side, they called it a convenient way to do without coins and paper cash. They are passing out scads of free cards and electronic reading devices so customers and merchants can try out the new technology. They're even giving out free money: the first time you load up with electronic cash, you get either $5 or $25 extra loaded onto the chip that is embedded in your bank card. I gave it a try. A young gent in a light blue blazer assisted me at the tiny white kiosk that has been set up in the Citibank branch at 96th Street and Broadway. He loaded $5 onto my new card, then let me punch buttons so I could load $10 from my savings account. For anyone used to automatic teller machines, this was simple. Citibank's letter said I could get ''up to'' $25 for trying the chip, so how could I have gotten that bigger bonus? You have to be exactly the 15th person at the branch to try it, the gent said. I was Number 17. Darn.
1997-10-19	In Search of a Meal in Terra Incognita	JUST south of the Massachusetts line is the small town of Granby. And less than a block from Route 20 in Granby is the Bank Street Bistro, a small restaurant in a strip mall. To a traveler in search of a decent meal in terra incognita, this cheerful, amiable cafe is a little jewel waiting to be discovered. Once inside, visitors receive a warm welcome. We were surprised to discover, as we entered for the first time early one Tuesday evening, that the restaurant was already half-full. A week night in Granby? The hostess explained that Tuesday was Granby Night, a time when four entree specials are offered, with salad, potatoes and vegetable included, for $8.95 (reservations are essential). When we told her we had driven a long distance, she relented, saying ''If you can finish by 7 o'clock, I can seat you.'' That gave us an hour. Where else could we go, we speculated and answered a quick ''Yes!''
1997-10-13	Money Becomes Electric	Can the computer-legible plastic cards that were mailed to some 50,000 bank customers on Manhattan's Upper West Side last week displace bills and coins between 60th and 96th Streets? For the moment perhaps not, but these cards are yet another sign that our relationship with money is changing. Bills and coins have been written off often in the last few generations, yet they continue to multiply. The electronic cash card itself has had a few dubious trial runs -- during last year's Olympic Games, for instance. But the promoters of the new cards -- Visa, Mastercard, Citibank and Chase Manhattan -- are betting that the urgency of the Manhattan existence and the sophistication of New Yorkers in pecuniary matters will help recommend this new medium of payment.

His father, David, simply pulled a Mastercard from his wallet, called the University of Maryland and said ''charge it.'' Besides the convenience, Mr. Fox likes the flexibility that credit cards provide to tailor payments to cash flow. Most important, however, are the thousands of frequent-flier miles that he accumulates each semester because his card is linked to an airline's mileage program.
1997-10-07	BUSINESS DIGEST	Federal Express to Buy Trucker for $2.4 Billion Federal Express plans to buy Caliber System, a trucking company, for about $2.4 billion in stock, in an effort to snatch more business from the strike-weakened United Parcel Service. The deal enables Federal Express to match U.P.S. in offering a wide range of delivery options, from its trademark air express to Caliber's local-package traffic. [Page D6.]
1997-10-07	West Siders Testing a Plastic Substitute for Pocket Change	Credit cards, debit cards, bank cards and transit fare cards already stuff the wallets of sophisticated New Yorkers. Now, the question being asked on Manhattan's Upper West Side is whether to bother with still another kind of plastic card that promises to make it possible to go shopping without pennies, nickels, dimes or paper money. Yesterday was the start of a multimillion-dollar test of so-called chip cards, plastic-and-silicon substitutes for coins and small bills, by four of the nation's largest financial institutions -- Citibank, the Chase Manhattan Bank, Visa USA and MasterCard International. But the experiment with a truly cashless society aroused only faint enthusiasm among merchants and shoppers in a neighborhood chosen because of the buying patterns of its wealthy, au courant residents.

But this season, for the first time, some local residents making their way along the country roads of southwestern Ontario near Toronto paid for their corn in a brand new way. Instead of prying small bills and Canada's bulky $1 and $2 coins out of their pockets, they handed over electronic cash cards. The Stroms, like 90 percent of the merchants in Guelph, jumped at the chance to participate in the first community-wide test in North America of ''smart cards'' that can be used for small cash transactions.

Why maddening? On my first visit, Grano looked like a winner. It seemed to have poise, inventiveness and staying power, and I imagined it might make this corner its own. But two more visits have shown wild inconsistency, like a rookie pitcher who throws a no-hitter one game and then can't get anybody out the next.
1997-09-07	Q. & A.	Halloween by the Bay Q. We will be in the San Francisco area at the end of next month and would like information on any Halloween festivities. -- Marcella Dugan, New York, N.Y. A. When it comes to celebrating Halloween, San Francisco refuses to play second pumpkin to any other city. The main event in the city itself, Halloween San Francisco, is moving this year to the Civic Center after 16 years in the Castro District, the city's gay community. If it's anything like previous years, the costumes should range from the outrageous to the spectacular. And it's all free. Call (415) 777-5500. The goblins and ghosts don't stop at the city limits. Half Moon Bay, a small oceanside town 20 miles to the south, considers itself pumpkin patch to the world. The orange gourds are grown all around the town, and on Oct. 13, the Great Pumpkin Weigh-Off starts the Halloween festivities. One word of caution, though: If you're thinking of joining the many entrants who come from all over the western United States to see who has grown the heaviest pumpkin of 1997, don't even bother unless yours is over 600 pounds.

Asian-Southwestern fusion still rules at the winsome Bright Food Shop, but a more ambitious selection of exciting new dishes can be attributed to the recent arrival of John Paul Damato, the new lead in the kitchen. For starters, consider the sea scallop ceviche, blended with lime juice and red chili oil, chopped and served on a crisp tostada; the chilled tomato and shrimp soup enhanced by the smoky flavor of chipotle chili, or smoked trout with red peppers, wrapped in rice and seaweed. Enticing entrees include bluefish salpicon, with the fish chopped and pickled with vinegar and serrano chilies and served in corn tortillas with black beans and a pumpkin seed pesto; mushroom enchiladas with corn and tomato salsa, and pan-roasted salmon in a crust of black sesame seeds with a basil-miso sauce. ($25 and Under: 8/17/97)
1997-08-29	$25 and Under	A friend of mine is so passionate about spicy food that he carries a bag of chilies with him, especially to Asian restaurants. Dismayed by the reluctance of these restaurants to spice their foods forcefully, he'll take out a Serrano or a Scotch bonnet pepper and serenely nibble away as his companions gasp and shrink back. But on our last visit to Ubol's Kitchen, he never even opened his bag. Unlike so many Thai restaurants in New York, Ubol's (pronounced U-bahn's) does not stint with its spicing or seasoning. Dishes marked on the menu as hot and spicy can be counted on to be searing, while dishes traditionally rich in fish sauce are suitably pungent. Curries are made with pastes blended right in the kitchen rather than with the packaged varieties that are so common. It is a reputation for authenticity that Ubol's has maintained for six years in its current spot, and for six more years on Broadway not too far away in Astoria.
1997-08-24	Gracious Meals in a Romantic Setting	MAIN & HOPEWELL in South Glastonbury, with its steady professionalism and welcoming atmosphere, is the kind of restaurant that comes to mind for special occasion dining, yet is priced so fairly that any dinner can really become a special occasion. The restaurant's three cozy dining rooms are quiet enough for real conversation -- bucking a current trend that suggests noise equals fun equals success.
1997-08-22	$25 and Under	For the Upper West Side, Azure offers an unusual combination: light, creative, ambitious food served in a friendly, informal dining room. It's the kind of place any neighborhood would want, but it is particularly welcome on this stretch of Amsterdam Avenue, where powerful drinks often seem more important than energetic cooking. The chef, Annie O'Hare, has cooked at more than a few New York restaurants, including Sign of the Dove, Arizona 206 and Steak Frites. At Azure, where she is a co-owner with Dale Monteith and Alan Zizmor, she offers a Mediterranean menu, a theme underscored in the rectangular dining room with lots of sun imagery, along with prominent paintings of plump, glistening fruits and vegetables. Even so, the dining room is spare, and it's loud when crowded, with voices bouncing from the brushed aluminum tables off a brick wall and back. In front, slat windows give Azure the look of a speak-easy or a garage.

1997-08-10	French Translation	THE best way to approach the tiny French restaurant Pourquoi Pas? is from Carlo Russo's Wine and Spirit World, one block west on pretty North Maple Avenue. The store has well-priced wines and a sweetness characteristic of the town. Pourquoi Pas?, which doesn't have a liquor license, shares this quality. It's small, but even when all 40 seats are occupied, as they often are on weekends, the dining room feels intimate rather than crowded. The servers wear light, flowery dresses beneath clean white aprons, and the walls, a combination of wooden shingles and white stucco, feature paintings and decorative objects restored by the owner's wife, Kathleen Vard, who runs a crafts shop in Rutherford. The mood at Pourquois Pas? is defined by its genre -- a French restaurant on a main street in town -- but it is family-run and therefore feels more like a home than a business.
1997-08-08	$25 and Under	At Swan Oyster Depot in San Francisco, paradise is a platter of Pacific oysters on the half shell, a bowl of chowder, a length of French bread and a cold beer, served at a long marble counter. Rebecca Charles and Mary Redding, two cooks from New York City, discovered Swan for themselves on a vacation last year and decided that New York needed what San Francisco had. Taking Swan as their model, they opened Pearl Oyster Bar this summer on Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village. Like Swan, Pearl is simply a marble bar with rickety chairs, a row of seats along a narrow shelf on the side wall and a couple of small tables. When it's packed, it holds 25 people. While Swan exudes a kind of Barbary Coast rakishness, Pearl offers a more clipped, coastal Maine feeling, complete with a collection of nautical lanterns on the shelves behind the bar.
1997-08-08	Citibank Consolidates, Stunning Madison Ave.	In what is probably the largest shift in the history of Madison Avenue, Citibank unexpectedly announced yesterday that it would consolidate virtually all its worldwide advertising and direct marketing assignments at a single agency company, Young & Rubicam Inc. Estimates of Citibank's actual or planned annual billings for the assignments involved -- which include campaigns for consumer and corporate banking, credit cards and burnishing the Citibank image as well as telemarketing, direct mail, brochures and sundry other sales pitches -- ranged from $500 million to as high as $700 million.

1997-08-03	From North Gate, a Vision of Paradise	ON a warm, sunny day, arriving on the tented patio of this restaurant feels like arrival in paradise. Across North Gate's broad lawn sloping to the Hudson River's edge lies the beautiful broad northward sweep of water and mountains. There is not a serpent in sight, and the apple is candied and served with red snapper. Summer evenings settle in slowly, turning the river to shimmering silver, which makes silhouettes of trees and, on one occasion, of branches arching over a painter in a long flowing skirt and wide-brim straw hat, her brush to easel. For a moment we are transported back into the 19th century. Diners can eat inside and still have the view, but to our mind, summer is for dining in open air. At tables on the patio just outside the restaurant, we sampled dishes from the full dinner menu. Under the far end of the huge white tent, an active bar and a cluster of tables stocked with ketchup bottles provide space for those preferring items from a light menu (hamburgers, ribs, sandwiches, pizza). A large dance floor separates the two areas.
1997-07-31	Mastercard Caps Debit-Card Liability	After vocal complaints from consumer groups, Mastercard International said yesterday that it would cap liability at $50 on its debit cards that are lost or stolen. The move marks an abrupt change in its debit card policy. In the past, card holders could be held responsible for unlimited loses from theft of their debit cards, which siphon money from the user's checking account.
1997-07-31	Visa Processing Rates to Rise 5% to 6%	Visa International Inc. said today that it was raising the rates that United States credit card processors pay to banks that issue credit cards.

It is the first increase since 1991, the bank association said.

It looked as if the neighborhood, which is often called a restaurant wasteland, might finally support an ambitious restaurant.

But for the most part, little has changed. Just take a look at Ocean Grill.

Surely, But Debit Card Has Risks, Too	When Meredith Platt ripped open the envelope from Chase Manhattan Bank in March, she expected a simple replacement for her automated teller machine card. But the shiny blue piece of plastic that fell out could be used at more than just the corner cash machine. It was also good for siphoning money from her checking account at more than four million retail outlets nationwide. ''My first thought was, 'Why are they sending me a debit card when I didn't ask for one?' '' said Ms. Platt, a research psychologist in Orangeburg, N.Y. ''That just didn't seem right.''
1997-07-11	$25 and Under	For anybody wearied by the heavy, gloppy fare served at many Chinese takeout mills, Wu Liang Ye may reawaken the dormant appreciation of Chinese food. Wu Liang Ye is part of a restaurant chain in China with three branches in Manhattan: this one on East 86th Street, another at 338 Lexington Avenue near 39th Street and the third at 36 West 48th Street. Each is slightly different in menu and atmosphere, but all specialize in lively, robust and even delicate Sichuan dishes that are notable for their freshness and meticulous preparation.

1997-07-06	Following a Chef to a New Setting	NOTABLE chefs are worth keeping track of, which is what led us recently to Aqua in Clinton. Our quest was to see what Robert Johnson, formerly of Serina, then Cibo in Branford, was up to. To our surprise, we found ourselves inside what looked like a standard shoreside seafood house, nothing more. Even the menu at first glance had a been-there, done-that look, with its shrimp cocktail, clams casino, fried calamari and fried seafood plate.

1997-07-04	Restaurants	I didn't much like Balthazar when it opened in April. Oh, of course I liked the look of the place; its bold, sassy bistro airs were enchanting. So was the buzz: celebrities were everywhere and it was fun to walk around the enormous room trying to figure out why each of them had been seated in that particular place. One night it was a special thrill to leave the restaurant and find a panhandler staring resentfully at Jerry Seinfeld's disappearing back. But after I'd eaten my way through the bread basket (the bread is spectacular) and downed an oyster or two, I was always ready to leave; the food just wasn't very good. Then something happened. It got better. Lots better. I suddenly found I was gobbling up the short ribs (only on Saturdays) and longing for the good, garlicky brandade. Once, sitting in a traffic jam, I caught myself thinking longingly of the restaurant's steak frites. And after a lunch of pasta with broccoli rape and roasted garlic, I couldn't wait to go back.
1997-06-30	Penguin Sues Ex-Credit Aide As Embezzler	With an accounting-scandal investigation drawing to a close, the Penguin Group has concluded that a $163 million black hole in its balance sheet began with an elaborate scheme that subsidized a credit director's eclectic taste for diamonds and Louis Vuitton leather, Home Depot hardware and cruises aboard the Monarch of the Sea. The charges are detailed in a civil complaint filed in United States District Court in Newark on Friday by Penguin, the publishing arm of the British media conglomerate Pearson P.L.C. Essentially, the lawsuit accuses a former employee, Christina Galatro, her husband, Stanley, and Jerome Bedell, a collection agency owner, of a $1.4 million embezzlement plot so entrenched that, the company charges, Mrs. Galatro faxed instructions to manipulate the accounts while on a winter cruise.

1997-06-29	One-Horse Restaurant	THE drive to Chatfield's Grill and Bar is one of many pleasant aspects of dining in the popular restaurant, which is justly known for its terrific hamburgers. It takes you past the Far Hills Polo Club and the Stable (a dealer of ''thoroughbred motorcars'') and through that part of Somerset County where everyone would like to live but only people with the assets of a Malcolm Forbes or a Doris Duke can afford to buy real estate. This is old money, the kind required to make a town almost invisible.
1997-06-29	A Trip Into the Past Brings Comfort Food	RECOGNIZED as one of the historically interesting and superbly appointed -- in an Early American way -- hostelries in the world, Old Drovers Inn is almost a destination in itself, a trip into the past with all the comforts of the present. Bouquets and book-lined shelves add a lived-in look to bedrooms with wide- plank floors, fireplaces, capacious armchairs, hooked rugs and gleaming antique furnishings. Guests staying at the inn can dine upstairs in a bright, elegant dining room. Travelers stopping for only a meal go to the below-stairs Tap Room, where, from about 1750 and for the next 100 years, cattle drovers driving their herds to Manhattan found sustaining food and drink.
1997-06-29	A Map of America; No Skipping Dessert	THE site is the center of New Canaan, the name is The Bank on Main Street (in the former Union Trust Bank) and the theme offered is ''Main Street U.S.A.'' Delivered up at the town's newest restaurant is a complex and adventurous menu, with dishes from five regions of the country. Such eclecticism for the most part works extremely well. There is so much going on in each dish, with so many intriguing accessories, it's a wonder the kitchen staff can keep the ingredients straight. But they do, turning what could easily be overreach into a delightful dining experience.
1997-06-27	$25 and Under	As the blocks south of Houston Street between Lafayette Street and the Bowery began to orient themselves toward SoHo rather than Little Italy or the Lower East Side, Joe Perrotta, who owns a wine shop on Elizabeth Street, sensed a growing demand in his neighborhood for sushi. So he and a partner, Vincent Stravato, decided to do something about it. Five weeks ago, they opened their own restaurant, called Mottsu, in the spirit of Mr. Perrotta's wine shop, Elizabeth and Vine. Mr. Perrotta, who has no experience in the restaurant business, sees nothing out of the ordinary about choosing sushi as a specialty. ''It's just a job,'' he said. ''I guess anything can be done if you work hard enough.''

1997-06-15	Irish Rental Companies Rethink Insurance Fee	The car rental companies in Ireland, for a brief moment, decided to reject United States credit cards' collision coverage and require all American renters to pay for a collision damage waiver for their rentals. At an added cost of $9 to $46 a day, this change would have had a sharp impact on American visitors who rent cars in Ireland -- 369,000 last year. The change, announced in mid-May and scheduled to take effect June 1, was reversed on June 3, after the Irish Tourist Board intervened with the Car Rental Council of Ireland. Robert Prole, chief executive of the Car Rental Council in Dublin, said that the change had been postponed for further discussion at the tourist board's request, because visitors needed longer notice of such a step.

1997-06-08	Big Red Barn, Fireplace and Regional Fare	A YEAR ago, Long Ridge Tavern in Stamford was home to Restaurant Michael Michael and two years before that to Miche Mache. The current re-incarnation of the rambling red barn that dates to the Civil War era retains a casual, country look with pine tables and Windsor-style chairs. A flagstone floor, imposing fieldstone corner fireplace and 50-foot antique bar make the Tavern room the most inviting. Unfortunately, the least charismatic room is the only non-smoking room. If you want quiet, request seating in the tiny Nutmeg room or, weather permitting, on the terrace.
1997-06-06	Companies Play Up The Promotion Game	If Silver Charm outraces his four-legged colleagues in the Belmont Stakes tomorrow, he and his biped owners will share in a $5 million bonus from Visa U.S.A., title sponsor of the Triple Crown Challenge. But the cash will not come from Visa. Chubb & Son, an insurance company, will enrich the lucky equine. Before Silver Charm starts dreaming of a credit card shopping spree on Rodeo Drive, he should remember how Bet Twice wrecked Alysheba's Triple Crown at Belmont in 1987 and Easy Goer ruined Sunday Silence's Belmont in 1989.
1997-06-06	$25 and Under	Paul Gobert, the chef and owner of Max & Moritz, grew up in Vienna, where he read ''Max & Moritz,'' the story of two German children rich with mischief and its consequences. His affection for the little katzenjammers, whose primordial cowlicks look like models for Bart Simpson's, stayed with him through his years as a pastry chef and later as chef at Bistro Jules in the East Village. So when he opened his own restaurant in Park Slope last December, he decided to call it Max & Moritz, perhaps out of sheer childish delight in finally owning his own place. He even used their silhouettes as his logo. The dimly lighted, casual dining room and deft French-American cuisine is so pleasant that the restaurant is packed most nights, both a tribute to its likability and an indication of the dearth of alternatives in Park Slope. People seem to filter in throughout the evening, standing in the vestibule or in the wood-and-brick rear of the dining room, which is no more than a wide aisle.

1997-05-30	$25 and Under	As far as I can tell, Cambodian Cuisine is the only Cambodian restaurant in New York City. Why? Partly because New York City doesn't have many Cambodians (about 2,500 in 1990 and few more since then, according to Frank Vardy of the City Planning Office) and partly because Cambodia does not have a restaurant tradition: most meals are eaten at home, and dining out is rare.

The excellent food is a balance of Swedish tradition and modern taste. Dinner might begin with a delicate composition of seared tuna with shiitake mushrooms and scallop chips, glistening gravlax with mustard sauce and pickled fennel, or a herring sampler, where the fish ranges from pickled to fried, served with a tangy Vasterbotten cheese. Main courses include halibut enveloped in Swedish ham and finished with tomato broth enriched by a drizzle of black olive oil, steamed sea bass with a ragout of littleneck clams in a carrot-ginger broth, roast venison chop paired with pumpkin gnocchi in a lingonberry-merlot jus, and tea-smoked breast of duck topped with seared foie gras and garnished with orzo.

1997-05-20	Tiger Woods Signs Pact With American Express	Now that he has more than enough money to qualify for credit cards and to require a staff of financial advisers, the golfer Tiger Woods has signed a five-year contract to become a spokesman for one of the biggest providers of such services, American Express. Mr. Woods, who is 21, will join Jerry Seinfeld as an American Express spokesman, the latest in a line of celebrity endorsers dating to the 1970's, when Senator Sam Ervin asked, ''Do you know me?'' in the company's commercials.
1997-05-18	Times Square's New Act	THE Times Square of my youth was neither the romantic crossroads of a great city nor a glitzy entertainment destination. It was a scary place of decay that you walked through quickly to get to someplace else, and always with $5 stuffed in your shoe. My grandfather Sam, who never left his apartment in Flatbush without checking twice to see if the oven was turned off, insisted on the footwear security measure for those weekends in the late 1960's when I took the bus from New Jersey with my friend Neil Muhlberger to see a Broadway play or musical. It was the only one of his urban anxieties that I found contagious.
1997-05-18	Creme de la Creme	THIS is horse country, so it's not unusual to see Governor Whitman or a Forbes in any of the five comfortable dining rooms at 89 Main Street, which opened in December in quiet, beautiful Peapack. The party celebrating birthdays at a neighboring table isn't so renowned, but its members are interesting to observe for other reasons. First, they pay the proper homage to the lobster pan roast, which contains half a lobster and other lush ingredients like heavy cream and saffron oil. Second, they maintain an enviable ratio of wine and champagne to people: one bottle for every guest.

Soon after he completes his four-year college journey, he will begin another long trip: paying off, over 10 years, a six-figure accumulation of loans. Mr. Gibbs, 22, is hardly without resources. He is ambitious and smart, having made Phi Beta Kappa while majoring in international studies and German. And he has landed a job on Wall Street, at Smith Barney, where he will be paid a salary in the mid-$30,000 range, plus the potential for bonuses, to help evaluate the performance of the firm's divisions. He plans to begin work on July 7.
1997-05-17	GENERAL MOTORS LOSES SUIT OVER CREDIT CARD	A New York jury awarded $24 million to a New York promotional marketing agency Thursday in a breach of contract lawsuit against the General Motors Corporation over the origins of the G.M. Mastercard. The agency, Communications Diversified, contended that in the early 1980's it talked with Chevrolet officials about creating a credit card that would offer rebates on cars and trucks. G.M. researched and rejected the idea, During the 1990's, G.M. began the G.M. Mastercard program. Officials of Communications Diversified said G.M. had violated an agreement by offering a credit card without involving them. The jury agreed.
1997-05-16	Restaurants	''There are no restaurants like this in Rio,'' say my Brazilian friends, seating themselves in the warm and festive room that is Circus. ''Nobody wants to go out to eat the food they cook at home.'' The recent spate of churrascarias, where meat in copious quantities is the main thing, is giving us a very odd idea of Brazilian cooking. An entire generation now thinks the people of South America's largest nation sit down to vast amounts of steak and potatoes every night. But while places like Churrascaria Plataforma faithfully reproduce a form of restaurant popular in Brazil, Circus serves the food your mother might cook if you were raised in Sao Paulo or Bahia. Picadinho and muqueca de camarao might not have many takers in an upscale Rio restaurant, but New York is a different story: Circus is usually packed with Brazilians eager for a taste of home.
1997-05-09	$25 and Under	These days it seems as if an American restaurant can't open without whistling the same old song. So the ears tend not to hear yet another chorus of meatloaf, steak and chicken. But Drovers Tap Room, the new American restaurant that was opened last month by the owners of Home, is hitting such distinctive notes that even the tuned-out are taking notice. Drovers is a family restaurant in the strictest sense. The husband-and-wife owners, David Page and Barbara Shinn, have tried to recreate the sort of Midwestern family restaurant that Mr. Page remembers from his childhood in Berlin, Wis. But Drovers -- Drover is the maiden name of Mr. Page's mother -- is anything but nostalgic or sentimental. Enlargements of Page and Shinn family photographs adorn the butterscotch walls of the narrow dining room, conveying an almost documentary quality that makes you want to study them closely.
1997-05-09	U.S. to Ease Rules on Export of Finance Encryption Technology	Giving ground on the Clinton Administration's computer-data privacy policy, the Commerce Department said yesterday that it would begin in some cases to allow export of the most powerful data-scrambling technologies when used for securing financial transactions. The move departs from previous export policy, which had allowed export of the United States computer industry's most powerful privacy-protection software and hardware only if the technology enabled law-enforcement officials to obtain copies of the mathematical keys needed to break the codes. The revised policy would require no such code-breaking proviso in the case of certain types of financial transactions.
1997-05-04	Steak-Filled Rooms	PETE LORENZO, a former police officer, opened the cafe bearing his name in 1918. He was 6 foot 4, which was big -- ''especially for Italians,'' said Anthony Merlino, a descendant of Mr. Lorenzo's wife, Nancy, and a co-owner of the restaurant. Mr. Lorenzo's size may explain the famously huge steaks that hardly anyone finishes. Those who have tried to grapple with either the steaks or the cafe's other hearty dishes include Donald Trump, Bill Bradley, Brooke Shields, Louis Armstrong, Lillian Carter, Eleanor Roosevelt (with Mary Roebling, the steel heiress, practically on a monthly basis), Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Merv Griffin, assorted legislators, assorted lobbyists and whoever happens to be (or to have been) governor.

1997-04-25	Restaurants	When Seryna opened 13 years ago, Japanese food still seemed exotic to many New Yorkers, and the idea of cooking steak on hot rocks at the table was something of a thrill. These days, however, sushi seems like a perfectly ordinary introduction to a plate of filet mignon, and the staid Japanese restaurant on East 53d Street seems like little more than an upscale ethnic steakhouse. But in a world where sushi is sold in supermarkets and good steak is not, this new perception should serve the restaurant well. You can find better sashimi, sushi and tempura in many other New York restaurants, but it is hard to find steak that can compare to Seryna's best.

Advanta had not marketed the Rewards Accelerator card since the lawsuits first arose in November. The program gave users of Advanta's Visa and Mastercards the opportunity to earn bonuses in ''Membership Rewards,'' an American Express bonus incentive program.

1997-04-06	Spot for Italian Offerings in Pleasantville	DESPITE its name (Strega), meaning ''witch'' in Italian, patrons will find no witches at Caffe Strega. Little sorcery is practiced here, unless, perhaps, with a few of the recommended offerings, like two enchanting efforts: ravioli and basil mashed potatoes. Certainly no amount of wizardry can expand the perimeters of the restaurant. Space is at a premium, and that might be why no reservations are taken. But at peak moments the wait for a table was only about 20 minutes, and the attractive bar is a congenial place. Once diners are seated, prompt service brings a small tub of hummus and a saucer of olive oil with garlic -- dips for decent bread. The menu is a mix-and-match affair with choices for all comers. Whatever the appetite, the hands-down best beginning was ravioli. Offered as a daily special, those floppy, glossy half-moon packets proved special. Visible through almost transparent wrapping, the filling changes daily, and our samplings of ricotta with broccoli rape and with spinach were splendid.
1997-04-02	Not All Plastic Is Created Equal When It Comes to Renting a Car	Remember that heartwarming commercial that ran during the Super Bowl in which Bob Dole could not buy lunch with a check at a diner in his Kansas hometown but could with his Visa debit card? Well, if Mr. Dole had tried to rent a car with that card, he would have gone nowhere. The big car rental companies, including Hertz and Avis, have recently stopped letting people rent cars using just a Visa Check card or the similar Master Money card from Mastercard. The card companies, and the banks that issue these cards -- known as debit cards -- are furious. And so are some customers.

Vacationing in France last summer, I drove my rented Audi into a pillar in an indoor parking garage, amputating the side-view mirror and putting a sharp crease in the front fender. As unnerved as I was by the accident, I was also pleased, because it meant I'd be getting a tangible payoff from the exorbitantly priced $20-a-day collision damage waiver I'd bought.

That's particularly appropriate for this seven-month-old Thai restaurant: when you walk up the stairs from Second Avenue, pass the door to a yoga school and enter Holy Basil, you almost feel as if you've entered a church.

Sportsmen and sportswomen are welcome, of course, but the Tap House Cafe is now a more deliberate stop for all comers, whether by train or carload. The roomy taproom proper -- about 40 beers are usually on tap -- is lined with greenery and raised tables, the two at the front snugged into window alcoves for train and town watching. At the back, which could use a bit of dash, tables set for two and four offer conventional restaurant dining.
1997-02-28	American Express Names Apparent Successor to Chief	The American Express Company said yesterday that it had appointed Kenneth I. Chenault, a smooth, 16-year veteran of the company, as its president and No. 2 executive. Mr. Chenault, who had been one of four vice chairmen, has long been seen as a leading prospect to replace Harvey Golub, the company's gruff chairman. In a letter to employees, Mr. Golub, who is 57, said the appointment made Mr. Chenault, 45, ''the primary internal candidate to succeed me when the time comes.'' But Mr. Golub said he planned to keep his job until he reached 65.

Uruguay, like its neighbor Argentina, is a carnivore's paradise. At 18 de Julio, named for the date that Uruguay celebrates its constitution, the focus is on beef -- more precisely, great big slabs of beef, served unadorned, still sizzling from the grill.

Purists may disdain the torrid colors of the new wall painting in the atrium but the golden terra cotta arches and ceiling remain intact. More to the point, the food is sparkling and celebratory, a culinary fusion of East and West. The results, in dishes like barbecued duck on scallion pancakes (with wild mushrooms, a tangy grilled fresh pineapple confit and miso plum sauce) or Asian vegetable roll (four crunchy filled wonton rolls on lettuce leaves, with a jalapeno-orange dip and wasabi on the side) were nothing short of stupendous, piqueing the palate with taste sensations in every bite.
1997-02-14	$25 and Under	The term comfort food has earned a pedestal in cliche heaven over the last 10 years, but that has not made the nurturing, unthreatening dishes embraced by the term any less popular. Nor has it discouraged restaurants from endless offerings of meatloaf, roast chicken, salmon and steak. Can you chew mashed potatoes and yawn at the same time? It doesn't have to be this way. Even a little twist can instill new life in the formula. Harvest, which opened in October in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, plays successfully with the tried and true, offering not just comfort food but also a comfort restaurant that is lively and pleasant, appealing to parents and children as well as to a more artsy, musical crowd.

Barkies (owned by the proprietors of the Union League Cafe a few blocks away) has its main dining room on the upper floor of a two-story building. The room is divided into two sections by a row of palms and other greenery. On the lower, first-floor level is a bar on one side, an open grill on the other, with tables for dining near the grill. The lower grill area is amusingly painted with various dogs (for whom Barkies is named).

1997-02-09	Some Surprises After Some Letdowns	I DREADED returning to 68 West Main in Oyster Bay after a disastrous first visit. A tablemate that night called the experience the worst of all worlds. ''I had a terrible meal'' he said, ''but still put on two pounds.'' But on a second try, thoroughly satisfying food had guests beaming. I wondered what was going on and inquired if the chef had been away on the ill-fated night. (He had not.) Because of that initial meal, when even the rolls were burned, the rating for 68 West Main can be no higher than good. A mark of restaurants in the very good to excellent range is consistency. Pray for a good night.

1997-01-28	Card Giant Announces New Job Cuts	Continuing to tighten its belt in the face of brutal competition in the credit card industry, the American Express Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 3,300 jobs, or about 4.6 percent of its work force, this year. The layoffs were not expected because American Express has already subjected itself to three waves of re-engineering and cost-cutting since 1991, eliminating a total of 12,000 jobs. By its own count, these efforts have reduced its annual operating costs by nearly $2 billion. American Express did, however, have money to spend from a $300 million after-tax gain on the sale of its holding of First Data Corporation stock. It set aside $138 million of that for a special charge to cover the severance costs of another round of cutbacks. All of the job cuts will be in the Travel Related Services unit, which issues credit and charge cards. Of the cuts, 2,000 will be outside the United States, affecting about 8 percent of the overseas work force. The company said the cutbacks would not increase earnings because the money saved would be invested in new business ventures. In the fourth quarter of last year, American Express earned $595 million, including the First Data gain and the restructuring charge, a 55 percent increase from a year earlier, the company said yesterday. Excluding the one-time items, the company's earnings were $433 million, up 13 percent from the previous year. Revenue continued to grow at the sluggish pace of 5.1 percent, to $4.3 billion. Excluding the special items, the company earned 90 cents a share, about what analysts had expected. The card unit, the company's largest, earned $299 million in the fourth quarter, excluding the special charge, up 12 percent. American Express is beginning to show some success in its effort to compete with banks that issue Mastercard and Visa credit cards. It has been pushing a line of Optima cards, which charge interest on unpaid balances, unlike its traditional green and gold charge cards. Loan balances on its Optima cards increased by 28 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to $12.7 billion. But net revenue from finance charges increased only 4.5 percent, to $3.1 billion, presumably because much of the growth in lending balances was at low initial ''teaser'' interest rates. Total cards in force increased by 1.2 million in the fourth quarter, up from the one million new cards issued in the third quarter. ''This was a great quarter,'' said Susan Roth, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''Their volume is growing almost as fast as Visa and Mastercard, so they are not losing share anymore,'' she said. The wave of consumer defaults on credit card loans has hit American Express, with its write-offs increasing to 5.2 percent in the latest quarter from 4.5 percent a year earlier, although that increase has not been as sharp as at other issuers. Still, American Express appears to believe that the Optima strategy is not enough to restore its growth and has been trying to recruit banks to issue American Express-branded cards. While several banks outside of the United States have joined its program, no domestic bank has signed up. Harvey Golub, American Express's chairman, offered to sell the company to Citicorp late last year, although talks have stopped. Analysts say this is a sign that Mr. Golub is pessimistic about American Express's prospects on its own. ''The behavior by Harvey Golub over the last year has not been the behavior of a market leader,'' said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. By contrast, American Express Financial Advisers, the company's investment and insurance sales unit, continued to grow briskly in the last quarter of 1996, propelled by the bull market. It earned $155 million in the fourth quarter, up 17 percent from the year before.
1997-01-26	Where Steak and Chops Make Their Case	MOODY'S Bar & Grill on the Post Road in Darien bears a vintage photograph of the golfer Helen Moody among many sports pictures on its cream- colored walls. But this new restaurant is not named after the golfing great. Rather, it is named after its owner, Doug Moody, who happens to be her great-nephew. His experience as owner of Backstreet, also in Darien, has no doubt helped in getting Moody's off to a fast start. The two plain-spoken dining rooms, with dark green booths, chairs and banquettes, have the simplicity of many a steakhouse. And indeed steak and chops are prime attractions here. There are surprises, though.

But Red Light offers more than good feelings; it offers a fine, reasonably priced menu of American bistro standards with Mediterranean accents, cooked by Ana Magruder, who was sous-chef at the excellent Alley's End on West 17th Street.

The eating spot, situated in a small house with an open porch for outdoor dining in warm weather and a gull's-eye view of the boats docking in Five Mile River, shares a driveway and ownership with the Rowayton Seafood store. This almost guarantees the freshness of the fish and shellfish on the menu. What the Restaurant has, that many similar seafood shop affiliates lack, are cooking skills. Wisely limiting the menu (there are just four landlubber dishes available), the friendly, informal place turns out an array of straightforward dishes that are satisfying in quality, generous in quantity and fairly priced.

Entrees include grilled sirloin served with bone marrow and garnished with rosti potatoes; pan-seared redfish paired with a red wine and lobster sauce and complemented by lobster hash and braised fennel, and garlicky lamb cassoulet replete with shank confit, lamb sausage, bacon and white beans.

1996-12-22	In Stamford, Where the Menu Is a Medley	TELLURIDE, on Bedford Street in Stamford, derives its name from the Colorado town and its decor hints of the West. Its menu also evokes the West, with names like Navajo fettuccine, Boulder crab cakes, Jesse James angus, pizza Cortez and pueblo pork. Names aside, most dishes draw on modern American, Italian and international trends that are currently popular. We began one dinner with a cup of Cuban black bean soup, a smooth puree with lively flavor and smidgens of jalapeno aioli on top. Celeriac soup was another smooth, satisfying starter, as was a dish called maize e funghi a la maison -- two squares of lightly grilled polenta topped with roasted red pepper and portobello mushroom, then blanketed in melted mozzarella, accompanied by teaspoonfuls of red pepper coulis.

1996-12-04	Credit Card Company Halts Marketing Project for Now	Giving way to a legal attack by Mastercard and Visa, Advanta said yesterday that it had temporarily agreed to stop marketing a credit card linked to American Express's frequent-flier program. The card, called the Rewards Accelerator, is a Visa or Mastercard credit card meant to be useful to customers who accumulate Membership Rewards points on their American Express account. Cardholders earn one point for every $10 in unpaid balances. The Advanta Corporation, a rapidly growing credit card issuer based in Horsham, Pa., introduced the card in early November, with a mailing of nearly half a million solicitations.
1996-12-01	Continental Aplomb	YOU can eat in the finest restaurant in the world, and it might not handle as large a crowd with as much grace and skill,'' a lawyer says about a recent dinner for 25 that he attended at Stephen's Cafe. You'll be equally impressed by the service even if it's a quiet Thursday and there are only four of you. Bill Marquardt, who owns the restaurant with Fernando Sanchez, the chef, is the kind of host who maintains long-term friendships with his customers. His energy and the vibrancy with which he plays the role all suggest he's a born restaurateur.
1996-12-01	Country Inn Style, Old-Fashioned Menu	IN Washington Depot, an old house overlooking the Shepaug River is now home to the G. W.Tavern, in space formerly occupied by the Bee Brook restaurant. To evoke a tavern mode while avoiding a cutesy faux-antique look isn't easy but G. W. Tavern has managed to do so with a landscape mural of soft colors (reminiscent of the work of 18th- and 19th-century itinerant artists) that wraps around the walls of the entrance hall and main dining room. The main dining room is the place for atmosphere: Oriental rugs add splashes of color to the wood floors, a bar is along one side of the room and booths, bench-banquettes and tables are throughout. A huge fieldstone fireplace is the room's magnet, in front of which a few lounge chairs are arranged. Unfortunately, this is also the designated smoking room. Non-smokers are relegated to a large closed-in porch with windows lining two sides, a long row of booths and a wooden floor: an area with the charm of a fast food eatery.

1996-11-24	Artful Premises, Tapas and More	BARCELONA, one of our favorite cities in Spain, has now lent its name to a wine bar in South Norwalk, and indeed the tiny spot more than deserves a rating of Good; in fact, it's verging on Very Good, showing infinite promise as a fun spot. A hole in the wall it isn't, though the space is minuscule. Artful design creates a fashionable atmosphere of black walls and ceiling with metal ductwork and pipes exposed, copper-hued leather banquettes and a long bar opposite high-style stools and tables. The food is as inventive as the look. In addition to a menu of tapas, entrees and desserts, additional daily tapas are posted on huge wall blackboards. The wine list is well-chosen from seven countries and well-priced with most choices in the $21-$28 range. There are also numerous wines by the glass from $5 to $7.50 and a small but compelling specialty beer list.
1996-11-24	But First, Dessert	THE plan is to dine at the Shubox Cafe and then see ''The First Wives Club.'' But we're having so much fun eating and talking that we skip dessert, and even then we miss the first five minutes of the movie. Missing a part of ''The First Wives Club'' isn't a problem -- none of us really likes it -- but missing dessert at the Shubox Cafe is cause for true sorrow. Maybe there aren't a lot of happily married people in New Jersey, but there are even fewer great desserts. The Shubox has done its best to remedy the latter situation since it served its first slice of fallen chocolate souffle cake when it opened in 1989.
1996-11-21	Social Security Workers Held In Frauds Using Credit Cards	Federal officials announced the arrests of a group of Social Security Administration employees yesterday, charging them with passing confidential information on at least 1,000 people to credit-card thieves for bribes as little as $10. Under the scheme, the employees would give out confidential information that would allow the credit-card thieves to use the cards when they made purchases. The authorities think the thieves were able to obtain the cards by stealing them through the mail, in some cases.

1996-11-17	Pizza in Darien, Pizza in New Canaan	THE Gates-Centro-Tequila Mocking Bird culinary empire rolls on. The newest enterprise of the seven-restaurant mini-conglomerate is Centro Ristorante and Bar in Darien. Situated in the long, two-level, rail-separated space formerly occupied by Bugbee & Brownell, the newest Centro shows some semblance of the same decorating flair as the earlier, wittier versions in Fairfield and Greenwich. A long expanse of wall near the entrance is engagingly painted with a mouth-watering still life, and the ceiling resembles a blue sky dotted with clouds and jubilant angels. As you'd expect, this Centro's menu speaks Italian, with a variety of antipastos, salads, pastas, pizzas and a few grilled dishes. The well-priced wine list, with 29 choices and a price range of $18 to $30 by the carafe, features several Italian and West Coast American wines.
1996-11-17	When the Bills Are Over the Top	THREE layoffs in in the past six years left the Litchfield County man with a mountain of debt that forced him into bankruptcy. The job he holds now as sales manager for a small contracting supply business grows more uncertain every day as the company's sales dwindle. The 35-year-old man and his wife, who have two young children, have put their home up for sale. For several years during the early 1990's, the man and his wife, a regional manager for a retail store, earned a combined income of $90,000 a year. Confident about the future, they enjoyed trips to Europe and Disney World. They took day excursions and went out to dinner often. But the good times were short-lived, and the third layoff came last year.
1996-11-10	At College, Many Learn How to Plunge Into Debt	Melissa Allen, a psychology major at the University of Maryland, cannot count on her parents for help with tuition. But rather than go deeply in debt with student loans, she is giving up much of the fun of college life by racing through in three years while working 40 hours a week at three jobs. ''I don't want to get out of here with a whole lot of debt,'' Ms. Allen said recently, on a break from one of her jobs.
1996-11-09	Deals Looming To Establish U.S. Ventures In Cash Cards	Three groups of banks and credit card companies are racing to complete deals in the next few weeks involving so-called smart cards -- cards embedded with microchips that can store electronic cash and other data. Next week, Mastercard International is expected to invest about $160 million to buy a 51 percent interest in Mondex, an electronic cash system developed in Britain, according to people familiar with the transaction. Spokesmen for both Mastercard and Mondex confirmed that the companies were in negotiations but declined to comment on the details of those talks.

Friends were asked to share the job. Susan Mills, who lives in McLean, Va., and is the director of program development for MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, summed up the experience as she left the tasting at 11 P.M.: ''I'm off to the all-night gym.''
1996-11-03	Little Dishes, Big Flavors From Spain	PIKA TAPAS CAFE, a newcomer to New Haven, is the latest of three eating places opened by Ignacio Blanco, proprietor of the first and best, Meson Galicia in Norwalk. The newcomer is features tapas, or appetizers. When we mentioned to a friend that we were going to a tapas bar, his eyebrows shot up as he said, ''I didn't know that was your sort of thing.'' Tapas, we repeated, not topless. The term is derived from the Spanish verb tapar, to cover, and originally tapas were tidbits served in a saucer that that was covered and would arrive free with a glass of red wine or sherry. In Madrid and other Spanish cities, some bars are known for tapas specialties, and people often make an evening of tapas-hopping from bar to bar, skipping a conventional dinner altogether.

Pastas are excellent and include tagliolini blended with prosciutto di Parma and quail eggs, and sweet potato and pumpkin cannelloni in marjoram sauce with Parmesan. There are entrees of roast rack of lamb with chestnuts and a rosemary sauce, pan-roasted striped bass with spinach, and braised veal spiced with garlic and orange zest and paired with a carrot galette.

1996-10-27	Half Caf, Half Decaf . . .	UNTIL a few years ago, there were several places in my town where you could go for coffee.

Now that not one but two Starbucks have settled into the landscape, everyone goes to them.

On the current menu are appetizers like marinated goat cheese atop mixed greens tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette; grilled shrimp set on a vegetable tart, and salmon roulade stuffed with a saffron-scented scallop mousse on a bed of spinach. Listed as main courses are stuffed pork chop with apple and pancetta in a creamy boursin sauce; pepper-crusted tuna steak served with lentils and vegetables; pappardelle mixed with duck, asparagus and shiitake mushrooms in a Madeira wine sauce, and osso buco of veal served with roasted potatoes.

Among the entrees are seared sea scallops and shrimp finished with a balsamic reduction and accompanied by radicchio, mushrooms and rice; pan-roasted monkfish in lobster sauce paired with a risotto, and blackened swordfish served with a sun-dried tomato butter and corn-avocado salsa condiment.

Shellfish is the main fare here -- steamed, fried, broiled or stewed -- supplemented by a few fish and pasta dishes. A good way to start is with a mound of shrimp, freshly steamed in beer and the traditional Old Bay spices, and served chilled; the first-rate rich, creamy oyster stew, or the good New England clam chowder. There are also fried belly clams and fried butterflied shrimp. Other selections include steamed mussels; broiled haddock with vegetables; steamed lobster, and grilled marinated salmon with cole slaw and steamed new potatoes.

1996-10-27	In Stamford, a Brew Pub in an Old Bank	STAMFORD has a new brew pub downtown, called the Bank Street Brewing Company, and it is not just on Bank Street, it's inside what was once the Citizens Saving Bank. Here, one can watch beer being brewed while enjoying what turn out to be delightfully cozy quarters. The building dates from 1913, and the current occupants have kept the magnificent stained glass dome above what is now the bar, the marble floors and a 40-foot marble teller counter that makes an excellent base for the long wooden bartop. One may dine upstairs overlooking the lively bar scene or in a quiet no-smoking corner along one side of the main room. Through the barred steel doors of the old vault, you can view the brew pub's liquor collection.
1996-10-27	Shooting Manhattan	JOHN WALSH came to New York University's film school as a bright-eyed freshman from Tarrytown, N.Y. Before long he had befriended Sally Roy, a classmate from Hartford who was originally a drama student but switched to film after realizing that a stage career meant she'd have to work nights. Just two players in the strange puree of ego, ambition, insecurity and competitiveness that is the film school, they collaborated on their undergraduate work, making the black-and-white shorts that are meant to be steppingstones to real-life movie careers. Sally would edit John's films; John would act as cameraman for Sally's. They graduated in 1984 and went their separate ways. Ten years later, they made a movie together that opened in theaters last Friday.

Stonehenge has always been very good. In its early life, decades ago, it was the kingpin of Fairfield County's fine dining scene. Then dining habits and tastes changed, the inn lagged, and through the years it suffered a series of mishaps: the death of its first owner-chef, Albert Stockli, and the pangs of new ownership as well as a fire that destroyed much of the old inn.
1996-10-19	2 Israelis Outline New Risk To Electronic Data Security	Two of Israel's leading computer scientists say they have found a way to more easily decode and then counterfeit the electronic cash ''smart cards'' that are now widely used in Europe and are being tested in the United States.

1996-10-13	Pay Bills Early? Now It Can Pay	GE Capital made waves recently when it announced that people who pay off their bills completely each month would have to start paying an annual fee for the GE Rewards Mastercard. The rationale is simple: Card holders who do not carry a balance just do not generate as much profit. Card issuers have long pointed to this when explaining why they offer sweeteners to people who revolve some debt month after month, though GE Capital is the first major card issuer to penalize those who do not.

Moreover, the friendly staff conveys warmth and informality, and the food is both tasty and an excellent value. Country pate, a plate actually combining both a moist pate and a silky, flavorful duck terrine, garnished with cornichons and a salad; mussels steamed in white wine and garlic, and the shrimp St. Tropez, sauteed with garlic, tomatoes and artichoke hearts all make fine starters. For main courses, steak is of course the specialty and is served five different ways: the Parisian-cut sirloin accompanied by crispy fries and a pitcher of Provencal mustard sauce; the New York-cut sirloin, simply bigger and more expensive; rib eye, and filet mignon served plain or au poivre.

One might begin with the tuna carpaccio with its garnishing of black olives and capers on a bed of greens; the assortment of lightly fried calamari, scallops, shrimp and zucchini, or the vibrant mix of endive, radicchio, mache and asparagus dressed in a citrus vinaigrette and topped with shaved Parmesan. There are pastas of tagliolini with tomato, goat cheese and basil, and veal-stuffed ravioli in a wild mushroom sauce.

For main courses, grilled red snapper was well prepared, simply flavored with olive oil, lemon and herbs; spaghetti primavera, blended with vegetables in a light tomato sauce, was satisfying, and a special of mahi-mahi came in a wholesome sauce of white wine, tomato, garlic and herbs with an accompaniment of string beans and carrots on the side.

For main courses, there are Cantonese-style suckling pig, sauteed chicken combined with mushrooms and asparagus pieces, and slow-cooked three-glass chicken in a sauce made of one glass of Chinese rice wine, one glass of chicken broth and one glass of a concoction of garlic, scallions, coriander, ginger and three kinds of soy.

Whether leeks vinaigrette, the hearty onion soup, brandade de morue (the garlicky puree of codfish and potatoes) or the velvety cream of mussel soup called billi-bi, these familiar staples are terrific starters. For entrees, the Alsatian choucroute garnie is a harmonious blend of pork chops, smoked sausages, chicken, sauerkraut and potatoes with juniper berries; pot-au-feu, the beef shank with its marrow comes in a full-flavored broth strewn with carrots, leeks and potatoes; roast lamb is served with stewed white beans, and seared hanger steak is topped with a red wine and shallot sauce.

There are pasta dishes like black tagliolini blended in a creamy sauce of tomato with salmon; spaghettini tossed with shrimp in olive oil, garlic and tomato, and porcini mushroom risotto enriched with the heady flavor of saffron. Main courses include veal scaloppine under prosciutto, fresh sage and melted mozzarella; veal scaloppine in Marsala wine sauce with portobello mushrooms, and sauteed chicken breast in a white wine sauce with zucchini, peppers and sun-dried tomatoes.

1996-09-29	Asian Cuisines in a Modern Marriage	THE restaurant build-up in South Norwalk continues. Hunan Harmony is a latecomer, offering Japanese and Chinese cuisines in a well-lighted, modernized storefront that extends from a street-level entrance on Washington Street to a parking lot entrance up a few steps, flush with the SoNo Cinema. For moviegoers it couldn't be more convenient. Often when an establishment attempts to offer two cuisines, both suffer. Such combos seem to work better with those cuisines that share ingredients and similar cooking styles. In recent months we have observed Thai and Vietnam cuisines combined under a single roof to mutual advantage. Now at Hunan Harmony we have a modern marriage of Chinese and Japanese, modern because each cuisine keeps its separate identity. There is a four-page Chinese menu and a two-page one for the Japanese dishes. A sushi bar is near one end of the restaurant, overseen by a Japanese sushi chef.

Begin with a fricassee of baby calamari; grilled marinated sardines with sweet and sour onions; fennel and grapefruit salad with Parmesan shavings, or little mussels sauteed in olive oil with garlic. Pasta choices include potato-and-leek ravioli in brown butter sauce with sage; pappardelle topped with duck and mushroom ragout, and potato gnocchi in a sauce of tomato and fresh herbs. For entrees, there are roast chicken perfumed with rosemary and garlic; pan-roasted duck in a red wine sauce; rabbit braised in a jus of white wine and herbs, and grilled marinated shrimp with a roasted tomato sauce.

1996-09-26	Potential Flaw In Cash Card Security Seen	A potential security flaw has been discovered that might make it possible to counterfeit many types of the electronic-cash ''smart cards'' that are now widely used in Europe and are being tested in this country by banks and credit card companies -- including Visa and Mastercard. A paper set to be released today by scientists at Bell Communications Research says that the types of smart cards that could be at risk include those already employed in the Mondex cash card system and others used by European consumers. A cash card from Visa International Inc. was demonstrated in a highly publicized trial at last summer's Olympic Games in Atlanta. The Chase Manhattan Corporation; Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, Mastercard International Inc., and Visa plan a test this year with 50,000 customers in New York City.
1996-09-22	Blending Flavors From Tropical Islands	VSITORS to the New Britain Museum of American Art (which has a fine collection from the 1740's to the present) or the American Clock and Watch Museum (another intriguing stop for its collection of 5,000 or more timepieces) in nearby Bristol may be looking for a place to have lunch. Following are a few in the vicinity worth visitors' attention. New Britain is home to five or more Polish restaurants, probably a state record. All are of the authentic, unpretentious home-cooking variety, decidedly non-fancy, non-gourmet. We especially like FATHERLAND (450 South Main Street, 860-224-3345), a good place to get acquainted with the staples of the Polish kitchen. The surroundings are simple, a spic-and-span storefront with Formica-topped tables, pink walls with pictures of Polish heroes and arrangements of artificial flowers.
1996-09-20	$25 and Under	For a new restaurant, Pascalou looks awfully familiar. Its interior, with cherished objects, faded tiles and not-so-fresh coats of paint, looks like any well-worn family restaurant in southwestern France. Before a two-week closing for renovation in August, Pascalou was the venerable Carnegie Hill Cafe. For the most part, it still is, except that it has a new chef, a new name, a new menu and what the owner, Lottie Baglan, hopes is a new beginning.
1996-09-18	American Express Scrambles to Remake Its Credit Unit	The American Express Company is doing just what it said it would to reclaim the glory days of its card business -- but that may not be enough. Two years ago, the company shifted its focus from its pay-as-you-go charge cards, with their lucrative fees, and belatedly showered the public with what clients really wanted: interest-bearing credit cards in a dozen flavors, many of them free.

The extensive list of Greek wines, including retsina, is an excellent match for the food. Diners might start with grilled sardines stuffed with an olive-and-basil paste and topped with feta-and-goat cheese sauce; shrimp fricassee redolent with fresh herbs under a lid of manouri, a mild Greek cheese, and sauteed calamari with fennel, dill and feta cheese. For main courses, the succulent grilled lamb chops are a winner; fillet of snapper is sauteed and flavored with anise and caraway and served on a bed of spinach, and a dish of baby goat is baked and served with rice and yogurt.

1996-09-13	$25 and Under	Tsampa seems to be a peaceful place, as might be expected of a Tibetan restaurant. The spare interior of polished wood and brick, the handmade rugs hanging from the walls and the window niche in the rear, where a smiling Buddha sits before an ivied trellis, make Tsampa calm and restful, almost ripe for meditation. But then the music begins. Shimmering chimes descend into lowing flutes and into a Tibetan chant that sounds either like Linda Blair in ''The Exorcist'' or a flock of cicadas over a public-address system. Then it rises into a mechanical whine, as if a deli-man were slicing half a pound of ham. Wait, that is a machine. They're making carrot juice. Finally, a soft jazz ballad begins, and tranquillity is restored.

Diners can begin with a salad of roasted eggplant and tomatoes with goat cheese and fresh basil; snails in garlic-and-parsley butter; grilled portobello mushrooms and arugula with fennel and Parmesan, or tuna tartare with wasabi. Among entrees are a truffle-perfumed risotto with peas and asparagus; roast duck with a citrus sauce and broccoli rape; sauteed calf's liver complemented by a lingonberry sauce and cabbage; grilled leg of lamb with spinach and roasted turnips, and grilled strip steak served with french fries.

1996-09-06	$25 and Under	Mr. Tony was in a lather. For the first time in the 18 months he has been serving modern Southern dinners in this charming 25-seat restaurant, his father and several tables of relatives were visiting. Mr. Tony is normally a gregarious fellow, patrolling the dining room, kneeling by one table to describe the specials, sitting at another to make recommendations. But under the pressure of family scrutiny, Mr. Tony had shifted into hyperdrive. ''This is my father, right here!'' he announced to the dining room. ''It's his very first visit.'' Mr. Tony's father visited each table and shook every hand. As the family left, Mr. Tony slumped into a chair and smiled in relief.
1996-09-05	Andrew Lloyd Webber is breaking new ground beyond Broadway and London's West End.	SIR Andrew Lloyd Webber, who has taken the Broadway musical to new heights of popularity, is breaking ground in the advertising business as well.

T.W.A. is also sponsoring the New York production of the show.
1996-09-01	Scott and Zelda: Their Style Lives	MY grandfather F. Scott Fitzgerald would have been 100 years old this month. But it's hard to imagine him being anything but young. Somehow Americans will always picture him and my grandmother Zelda as the footloose adventurers who rode down Fifth Avenue on the tops of taxicabs, danced on tables at the Waldorf and took their famous plunge in the fountain at the Plaza or who partied in Paris. Scott's instant success qualified him to define the Jazz Age, and Zelda, in particular, was one of the earliest tabloid personalities. They enjoyed the kind of press attention that today is reserved for music or movie stars. Their spirit has long since been incorporated into our national self-image. They gave us license, as Americans, to have some fun. They symbolized zestful youth, and the country has deified youth ever since. And they made celebrity, and our fascination with it, stylish.

The Piedmontese cuisine of Italy is the theme here. There are starters of minestrone served at room temperature; prosciutto di Parma paired with mango and melon; fresh mozzarella with marinated eggplant, and a combination of lola rosa lettuce with roasted beets. Main courses include grilled rack of lamb with braised bitter greens, charcoal-grilled squab accompanied by cranberry beans and drizzled with a red-beet olive oil, roast rabbit served with a white wine and lemon sauce and risotto of porcini mushrooms.

The staff always seems eager to please. The assorted kebab platter of tandoor-roasted meats remains a fine way to start a meal, including the yogurt-marinated chicken tikka, boti kebab or cubed leg of lamb marinated in yogurt, ginger and garlic. Also good are the vegetable samosas, turnovers filled with a spicy mixture of potatoes and peas, and the pakoras, crispy fritters made of potatoes, cauliflower and eggplant. Dishes to consider among main courses are the meaty prawns marinated in yogurt and ginger, then cooked in the tandoor; hot curried lamb vindaloo, and tandoor-roasted chunks of marinated chicken simmered in a creamy sauce with tomatoes.

The perpetually packed bar, decorated with framed Broadway posters and other theater memorabilia, is diverting. For starters, black bean soup is a standard; a salad of endive, watercress, Roquefort and walnuts is lovely, and the assembly of cucumber, feta cheese, tomatoes and olive, flavored with fresh mint, is cool and refreshing. For entrees, calf's liver is a winner, combined with sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes; a breast of chicken is grilled and complemented by roasted vegetables.

The congenial staff is good about meeting theater schedules. Begin with the superior tender baby artichokes sauteed in olive oil with garlic and parsley; carpaccio of salmon with lemon and olive oil, or a salad of sliced tomatoes and mozzarella with fresh basil. Pastas might include linguine tossed in a garlic-fueled white clam sauce, cappellini primavera and porcini ravioli. Among main courses are pollo capriccioso: pieces of chicken simmered in a well-spiced tomato sauce with onions, sweet peppers and capers, and veal scaloppine with Marsala wine sauce and mushrooms.

The beguiling menu features appetizers like assorted breewats, which are phyllo pastries in the shape of triangles, squares and cylinders and filled with various meat and vegetable mixtures. Fillings include the peppery merguez sausage, sweet-and-sour chicken with preserved lemon, chicken livers and tender lamb. Other recommended options include a carrot and raisin salad, delicately sweetened by a marinade of orange juice and orange-blossom water; lemony hummus, and harira, a vegetable soup made with chickpeas and lentils. Tajine and couscous make fine choices for main courses, whether the lemon chicken tajine with olives and preserved lemons or the lamb and vegetable couscous.

Savory starters include grilled pears matched with Stilton cheese on a bed of greens and sprinkled with crushed walnuts; eggplant quesadilla paired with tomatillo salsa, and roasted wild mushrooms atop a grilled polenta galette. To follow are main courses like grilled salmon with a blood orange sauce and accompaniments of asparagus and roasted potatoes; chicken with lemongrass set over stir-fried rice noodles, and grilled loin of beef in a red wine sauce with roasted shallots and mashed potatoes laced with horseradish.

Almost single-handedly, Orso brought back the Broadway movers and shakers, and it remains as fresh and vibrant as ever. The menu changes daily, with a seductive roster of salads, pizzas, pastas and entrees. Appetizers might include yellow split-pea and spinach soup, prosciutto with melon and kiwi, garlicky bruschetta, or goat cheese and spinach salad with grilled onions. The pizzas are another good way to begin, whether topped with tomato, mozzarella and prosciutto, or brushed with tomato, oil and rosemary. Pastas and entrees could include tagliarini mixed with clams, calamari and oregano in a fresh tomato sauce; penne tossed with eggplant, spinach and tomato, and braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes.

1996-08-18	Sweeping Views and a Brand New Menu	THE dining room at the Gelston House in East Haddam is now called Gelston House River Grill. The name is not the only change in this handsome Victorian Italianate building, now a property of the equally ornate Goodspeed Opera House, just a hop, skip away. Most of the Victorian flourishes -- floral carpet and heavy draperies -- have disappeared. Now, well-spaced tables offer stunning views from windows all along one side of the dining room. A dark green carpet and simple upholstered chairs do not distract from spectacle of cruise boats gliding along the Connecticut River below.
1996-08-11	When Food and Service Seem at Odds	THE food alone at Sole e Luna Ristorante Toscano, next door to the Westport Playhouse, is for the most part excellent (if pricey) but service is so slipshod, slow and unwelcoming that the dining experience is often soured when it could be soaring. One's spirit is not cheered by such things as a one hour and forty minute wait for entrees to be served (while theatergoers arrived, ate and went), having a bottle of wine that was ordered at entree time delivered with dessert, receiving the check without having asked for it and without having been offered dessert or coffee, having one's coffee delivered to another table but charged to ours.

Entrees include roast cod with a ragout of fingerling potatoes, lardons and New Zealand cockles in a citrus-and-parsley juice; braised lamb shank with preserved lemon risotto, and crisp sweetbreads served with a port-and-caper sauce over celery root and with Swiss chard.

1996-08-04	Let the Credit Cards Compete	TODAY, if you call your bank and ask for an American Express or Discover credit card, you'll be told to go elsewhere -- but don't bother trying another bank. Virtually all the 6,500 banks nationwide that issue credit cards belong to the Visa or Mastercard associations, and the handful of big banks that control these groups have collaborated successfully to eliminate unwanted competition. What is good for these huge banks is manifestly bad for millions of American consumers and for many not-so-big banks because the status quo means a wholly unfair and artificial limit on their choice of products and services.
1996-08-04	Lots of Pizzas, in a Sometimes Odd Setting	INHERITING space formerly occupied by a Mexican restaurant, Vicolo Pizza and Trattoria in New Canaan has converted it into a cheerful evocation of Italy, complete with rough-textured pastel walls, one with an Italian scene; terra cotta tiled floor, framed posters, faux windows lighted from behind and a blue ceiling flecked with clouds. Some of the staff are, however, considerably less charming than the decor. A hostess and a waiter seem to alternate door duty; her boredom and his grumpiness do little to enliven the meeting/greeting process.
1996-08-02	$25 and Under	Spruced-Up Vietnamese Mekong stands out from the wave of Vietnamese restaurants that has been sweeping over New York City. Most of these restaurants have adhered closely to the Chinatown model of plain interiors, no-nonsense waiters and food served fast. Gussying up, for the most part, has consisted of dispensing with tea served in juice glasses, and adding Breuer chairs and mirrors to the dining room. But Mekong, which opened last fall in Little Italy, owes its allegiance more to SoHo than to Chinatown or Vietnam. It has a dim, relaxed ambiance and pleasant outdoor seating across the street from St. Patrick's Old Cathedral.

Since my parents have been kind enough to take the children for the weekend, we're going to inaugurate our 48 hours of child-free splendor with an overnight stay at Evermay on the Delaware, a bed-and-breakfast just across the river from Frenchtown. Interstate 78 is blissfully uncrowded, which is fortunate, since the prix fixe dinner at the Evermay starts promptly at 7:30 P.M.

Not being able to use the tickets, I returned them for refund of $289.70 to my credit card account. Back in the United States, I was surprised to see that the amount credited to my card was only $60.58, which corresponds to 289.70 Bolivianos. After I made several phone calls to La Paz, the agency sent me a copy of the credit slip, which showed unambiguously a refund of $289.70. I forwarded the credit slip to Colonial National Bank of Wilmington, Del., issuer of my Mastercard, asking the bank to correct the error.

Thousands of envelopes move briskly along a conveyor belt until they are sucked into a 30-foot-long contraption buzzing loudly with spinning rollers and flashing lights. These are phone bill payments to Pacific Bell, a deluge that brings in nearly $1 billion a month. Before the envelopes are opened, this huge machine quickly feels and weighs each one in search of staples, paper clips, folded checks or other minor acts of rebellion. Any of these could derail the high-speed equipment that will fish out the contents, update the accounts and prepare neat stacks of checks for deposit.

1996-06-23	Marriage, Italian Style	TO welcome you to Chiarella's, the chef sends out a small plate of the tiny toast squares known as bruschette. Many chefs do. But the bruschette prepared by Franco Serafino, a chef in Milan, Italy, for 25 years before he came to New Jersey, are distinctive. The bread is fresh and crisp, not at all soggy, and the tomatoes, basil and garlic are dressed, not drowned, in oil. These bruschette are cool, light and refreshing; even the tomatoes taste beefy, and it's not even July. Chiarella's, owned by Michele and Lucia Chiarella and managed by their son, Tommaso, was a former Stewart's root beer stand before the family converted it into a tiny restaurant that their enthusiastic clientele encouraged them to expand. Now it has a large and comfortable dining room in which you will occasionally see a baby carriage, Phil Rizzuto or the husband and wife whose order is so predictable that the waiter doesn't even bother to give them a menu: chicken francaise for him, rigatoni pomodoro for her.

""They say they make their own baked goods,"" he wrote. So do all diners. I ignored the note. A few weeks later, having run out of ways to feed and entertain my children, I took them to the Tri-Boro, where I found not only a wait, which is unusual for a diner that seats 170, but great bread. Among the varieties were sesame- and caraway-seeded rolls, white and whole-grain challah with raisins, and something called cheese bread, which is like the cheese danish of your dreams (more cheese, less danish). The sticky stuff on top is sugar. Yum."
1996-06-16	Dead as a Dollar	"CASH IS DIRTY -- THE NEW JERSEY Turnpike tried to punish toll collectors recently for wearing latex gloves (thus giving the driving clientele a ""bad impression""), but who can blame them? Cash is heavy -- $1 million in $20 bills weighs more than you can lift, and drug dealers have been disconcerted to note that their powdered merchandise is handier for smuggling than the equivalent money. Cash is inequitable -- if you are one of the 50 million Americans poor enough to be ""unbanked,"" you pay extortionate fees to seedy, bulletproofed check-cashing operations (even more extortionate than the fees charged for automatic teller machines, which are often up to 1 or 2 percent and rising). Cash is quaint, technologically speaking -- unless you're impressed by intaglio-steel-plate-printed paper with embedded polyester strips (meant to inconvenience counterfeiters). Cash is expensive -- tens of billions of dollars drain from the economy each year merely to pay for the printing, trucking, safekeeping, vending, collecting, counting, armored-guarding and general care and feeding of our currency. Cash is dying."

1996-06-14	25 and Under	Eyes can't help looking up on entering the Galaxy. Grand Central Terminal has its constellations, and the Galaxy has its stars, hundreds of twinkling bits of light glittering against a dark blue ceiling. Once, the Galaxy was a little Greek diner, where ragged teen-agers refueled on coffee and eggs after midnight, their ears still ringing from the rock-and-roll show at Irving Plaza next door. But a new owner, Denis Cicero, gutted and transformed the Galaxy, retaining only the name. In its place is a sleek, unusual, highly personal restaurant that borrows from cuisines around the world, showcasing the global vision of Mr. Cicero and the controlled creativity of the chef, Deborah Stanton.
1996-06-13	Justice Department Investigating Credit Card Practices of Visa	The Justice Department has begun an investigation into Visa U.S.A.'s policy of preventing banks that issue its cards from offering American Express or other competing cards. Investigators in the department's antitrust division are looking at restrictions on partnerships between banks and card companies, a Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed yesterday. The disclosure of the inquiry comes a month after a European Union official deemed the practice unacceptable, leading Visa U.S.A.'s parent, Visa International Inc., to back down from such a ban in Europe.

1996-06-06	Good Call on Credit Cards	"In a ruling involving billions of dollars, a unanimous Supreme Court this week upheld the right of national banks to charge late fees on overdue credit-card accounts -- in addition to charging interest -- even if a card-holder lives in a state that prohibits such fees. This was a clear victory for banks with interstate credit-card operations. But the outcome also stands to benefit consumers. The opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, rejected a class-action lawsuit against Citibank by California residents who contended that late charges assessed by Citibank on their overdue Visa and Mastercard accounts were ""unconscionable"" and, further, illegal under a California consumer-protection law. Citibank, the nation's biggest issuer of bank credit cards, conducts its business from South Dakota."

1996-06-02	When Tranquillity and a River Beckon	THE Stone House Cafe in Litchfield deserves an A for aiming to please, for its small staff really is accommodating. Maybe it's the tranquil country setting beside the Bantam River or the attractiveness of the old house, with its two stories doubling as art gallery and cafe that makes everyone so agreeable. Bright modern paintings can be seen on the pale cocoa-colored cafe walls, pink geraniums in clay pots in every window of the first floor dining room. Whatever the reason, the welcoming tone is much appreciated. It adds to the sprightliness of the place, with its simple wood floors and a mixture of different homey cotton place mats on each wooden table. The entire place exudes low-key good cheer.

1996-05-26	Exciting and Soul-Satisfying Offerings	PAOLO PENATI'S culinary fireworks lighted up the East End in 1990 at Fresno in East Hampton. But starbursts are shortlived. Mr. Penati soon left and the restaurant eventually closed. Now, the talented chef is once again brightening the Hamptons' landscape at Paolo's in Southampton. This time he is both chef and owner. His little diner look-alike, which drivers might or might not notice as they inch along Route 27 (County Road 39), is bursting with excitement. For a few seasons, this modest spot had been Doobies, a definite food find. But as good as it was, Paolo's transports the tiny roadside restaurant to new heights.
1996-05-26	More Ways to Earn Miles Without Flying	Lufthansa and T.W.A. are introducing yet more ways for members to earn miles without flying, and Dollar is starting a program to reward its repeat customers with car rental bonuses. Hertz is the newest affiliate of Lufthansa's frequent flier program, Miles & More. Members can earn 500 frequent flier miles by renting a car from Hertz. No flight is required. For more information: (800) 581-6400. Beginning this month, Trans World Airlines frequent travelers can earn mileage while keeping their feet firmly on the ground simply by dining out. Members of T.W.A.'s Frequent Flight Bonus program can enroll in Dining a La Card Miles and register up to three major credit cards: American Express, Discover, Mastercard or Visa. For every dollar charged to one of these cards at a participating restaurant, 10 miles is credited to the frequent flier account. More than 4,600 restaurants in 22 cities throughout the United States have signed up. Only one visit a month per restaurant qualifies. Mileage is earned for all charges, including drinks, taxes and tips, but there is a a maximum of 6,000 miles, or $600 per restaurant. After a 60-day free introductory period, the program will cost $49.95 a year. Information: (800) 804-7109.

Its citizens appear to be the most magnanimous big-city restaurant tippers in the country, ahead of diners in New York, Chicago and Boston, and way ahead of those who regularly eat out in San Francisco, Los Angeles and other points west. This information comes from the answers to questions asked of diners last year by the Zagat restaurant guides.
1996-05-10	Restaurants	In New York City, home of the fabulous, the chic, the loud and the exotic, a nice restaurant is a rare thing. So rare that when I encountered the pleasant staff at Aquagrill I was acutely uncomfortable. Don't those people ever stop smiling? No, it seems, they don't; the service was as nice on my last visit as it was on my first, and despite the increasing crowd in the dining room, it was never loud or rushed or edgy. Aquagrill has the comfortable air of a neighborhood place.

1996-04-28	Country Style, a New American Menu	ANYONE who remembers John's in Woodbury will be amazed at its transformation into John's Cafe. The old John's was a glorified short-order house. The new John's Cafe is a pretty, though not fancy, restaurant with tile floors, soft gray walls, sturdy wooden tables and comfortable rush-seated chairs with high backs. Racks of wine bottles serve to divide the entrance from the dining space.
1996-04-21	Where the Props Are Misleading	"THE visual symbols of the interior might discourage one from dining here, and that, alas! would be a mistake. For their theme restaurant, the owners of Laredo have chosen props straight from a ""B"" western of the 1950's. But once the food arrives, diners will not cavil about the fake cactus or the mounted animal skull and will find that Laredo is not a run-of-the-mill Tex-Mex eatery. It was easy to make short work of the tasty corn muffins -- on one of our visits made of blue corn flour -- brought to every table, and we were sorry we had indulged so enthusiastically when hearty portions of our order arrived. Tiny tender leaves of spinach made the base of a clean, lightly dressed salad, which cradled a small scoop of warmed goat cheese rolled in pecan pieces. Slices of portobello mushroom and slivers of fresh tomato completed the arrangement. Brushed with a honeyed barbecue sauce, a small portion of gently smoked ribs hit the spot."

But once through a narrow hall, past food cases and food aromas, bathroom and kitchen, the tiny dining room projects a completely different image: softly lighted, sophisticated dining that is as romantic as all get-out. The white-walled dining room is two stories high; floral-patterned draperies match the tablecloths, which wear white aprons, pink napkins and vases of fresh pink carnations. Tables are close together but the hum of conversation in the busy place makes eavesdropping impossible. It is a setting for intimate conversation, as evidenced by the abundance of couples-only tables.

Inside the restaurant, a different kind of storm was brewing. This new spot opened with its predecessor's name, Flippers, and the owners were now agonizing over a new one. The final choice, La Plage (the beach in French), emphasizes the restaurant's beachfront location while hinting at its sophistication. The use of French is more than an affectation. Cooking techniques here are rooted in France, even though the ingredients are American, including New York State foie gras, Pennsylvania free range chicken and local duckling.

1996-04-07	The Cooking is Down-Home Southern	"CATFISH, the epitome of Down-Home Southern cooking, has recently found its way onto the menus of fancy French restaurants. The aptly named Catfish Cafe in Lynbrook offers a delicious dish called ""catfish named desire"" that straddles both worlds. These pan-fried fillets with their lemon-pepper corn flour crust and lush marsala-spiked gravy, a meld of crayfish tails and wild mushrooms are not haute cuisine. But neither are they Friday night, all-you-can-eat fish fry fare. The Catfish Cafe proudly proclaims its Southern roots, while recognizing that the South is more than Louisiana. Of course, it offers gumbo, Cajun popcorn and jambalaya but dishes that represent the heart of Dixie, like chicken-fried steak, meatloaf, hush puppies, collard greens and fried chicken, also take a bow."

The cooking can be uneven, but an impressive number of dishes were nicely rendered. With some judicious selection, diners can have a satisfying meal here. Particularly appealing were a few new, fresh offerings sprinkled among the old familiar items, thus making Cocconato not quite just another Italian restaurant.

Not content to rest on his restaurant's past success, Simpson Kalathara introduces new items with welcome regularity, and right now his comprehensive menu lists dishes representing almost every corner of India from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin. Breads are serious here. New and usually offered only toward weekends are masala dosas; share one as an appetizer. These bronzed, foot-long cylinders of smooth paper-thin rice pancakes come filled with a delectable mixture of potato, peas, onion and mild spices. Chef's special nan stuffed with minced chicken and nuts and puffy onion kulcha with onions and seasonings made fine openers as well. But plain, fluffy nan remained our choice for the best bread with which to sop up the lovely entree sauces.

Kahn, the man who had come to save their company. The shareholders at the annual meeting last April of the long-beleaguered Safecard Services had cause for hope. Fifteen months before, Mr. Kahn had joined as chairman, bringing a reputation as one of America's savviest business executives. At AT&T, he had introduced the Universal credit card, building it into the nation's second-largest and winning the Government's prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. He told his new investors that perhaps he could win again -- for Safecard.
1996-03-17	Rebound Reported In Office Occupancy	"THE view to the east from Oxford Health Plan's new offices here show Westchester's rolling hills blanketed in snow. The west side affords a panorama of downtown White Plains. ""You've got the bucolic on one side, and you've got the urban on the other,"" said Steve Daniels, regional director of operations for Oxford. ""Of all of our offices, this is the nicest in terms of work environment."" Such words fall sweetly on the ears of beleaguered real estate agents in the county, who say that Westchester's office market is bouncing back as major corporations commit to the area, and vacancy rates continue to decrease. The improvement is particularly strong in downtown White Plains, which is considered pivotal to the county's overall economic health."
1996-03-17	A Surge in Second Second-Chance Finance	"THE neon signs promising ""fast cash"" flicker from dusty brick storefronts as they have for 50 years on this narrow stretch of Church Street known as Loan Alley.

There is a stage at one end of the room, a pool table and lounge area with two couches at the opposite end. A dark dining room ceiling and subdued lighting add to a nightclub atmosphere. Then comes the surprise: a small but intriguing menu, yielding several spicy, appealing dishes, most of them appetizers. In fact, the category ""appetizers and snacks"" leads one to the conclusion that the starter portion is ample enough to double as a light meal."

1996-03-08	Restaurants	"Mario, Marco and Mauro Maccioni, sons of Sirio of Le Cirque, seem to know me. In my three undisguised visits to their lively new restaurant, Osteria del Circo (pronounced CHEER-co), they have been extremely solicitous, popping up every few minutes to make sure things were going smoothly. When I ordered a sold-out bottle of wine, one of the brothers instantly appeared with another, more expensive bottle. Another night, a brother approached as I sat near the raucous bar, waiting for my guests to arrive. ""Are you sure you wouldn't like to go to your table now?"" he asked anxiously. The table was waiting and Mr. Maccioni whisked my coat away. I was so sure I had been recognized that I went back two more times, heavily disguised with wigs and glasses. The service, I am happy to report, was virtually unchanged; clearly the Maccionis have a commitment to caring for all their customers. Given the high-powered crowd and the clamor for tables, this must not be easy. But they are everywhere, young (the oldest is 30), smiling and energetic, and they seem to be having a wonderful time."

     The new card, introduced last month by Delta Air Lines and American Express,  offers the standard deal for co-branded airline cards: one frequent-flier mile for every dollar you charge.

1996-02-11	More Card Holders Get the Gold Treatment	IT started as a game two years ago for Kirsten Dieringer and her pals at Michigan Technological University in Houghton. Tired of chomping only on pizza and convinced she would soon graduate into poverty, Ms. Dieringer decided they all needed some quick financial muscle. A race was begun to see who could rack up the most gold credit cards before graduation. Talk about breezing into the winner's circle. Despite no steady income or credit history at the time, Ms. Dieringer picked up a Citibank gold Visa by listing her stock holdings -- 150 shares of RJR Nabisco and 500 shares in the Bank of Texas (both gifts from her grandfather) -- and a phony job on the application. Within a year, her perfect credit history had produced two more golden eggs -- a $10,000 Chevy Chase Visa account and an $8,000 credit line from First Card.

Each of them will be able to offer services now provided by the others. The bill's enthusiasts (only 16 members of the House and 5 senators voted against the bill) and the companies themselves say Americans will have more choices, and companies will compete through lower rates and better service. ""We have broken up two of the biggest government monopolies left: local telephone service and cable TV,"" crowed Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, who managed the bill through the House. Consumers Union, however, predicted that cable television rates would rise, and others worried about what impact the concentration of power in the broadcasting business would have on local ownership and program content."
1996-02-04	Third-Generation Italian in New Haven	IN a revolving door industry, where establishments come and go with distressing frequency, any place that survives 10 years is considered a major success story. This makes the longevity of Consiglio's in New Haven's Little Italy even more astonishing. The cozy little restaurant, opened in 1938 by immigrants from Amalfi, Italy, is now managed by members of the third generation of the Consiglio family. A much needed facelift a few years ago gave Consiglio's a lighter, fresher look, with two-toned tan walls, a white-washed brick wall, and tables close enough to encourage conviviality. While the menu has evolved to keep up with changing times, a few of the old southern Italian favorites, including lasagna, eggplant rollatini and pasta e fagioli, are still available.

We were 8 and impressed not only by the souffle, whose dark, rich heat I still remember, but also by the secret button my friend's aunt stepped on every time she wished to summon the cook. I always order souffles when I wish to feel pampered. The last three I've eaten were at Souffle, a French restaurant that opened 10 months ago in Summit. The chocolate was not as good as the one I remembered from my childhood, but that was to be expected; the second tasted too strongly of Grand Marnier, which some people will regard as an asset, and the raspberry was crusty, warm and delicious. The puree that came with it was like liquid fruit: tart, sweet and refreshing.

The dining area is softly lighted and romantic as all get-out -- until it gets crowded and the decibel level rises rapidly. While the medium-size Italian menu is varied enough, a long list of evening specials that was recited to us almost overwhelmed us. On our first visit we stuck with the printed menu and had a first-rate meal. It began with a small plate of antipasto that included pureed caponata, a delicious eggplant spread for the excellent crusty, fluffy bread.
1996-01-14	Commercial Property/Looking Back, and Ahead;Outlook: Cloudy, With Silver Linings	"BACK when 1994 was ending, any real-estate executive predicting a less than stellar 1995 was drowned out by the sound of champagne corks popping, as a euphoric industry toasted the end of five years of woe. The revelers turned out to be the pollyannas, the pessimists the realists. The much-touted ""recovery"" turned out to be an explosion of pent-up demand, as tenants who had waited for the rental trough ran out of time to make deals. Along about April, leasing activity slowed to a crawl, and nothing since has nudged the market out of complacency."
1996-01-14	Raising the Standard for Take-Out Meals	THE best meal we've had in recent weeks was not at a fancy restaurant but at home. It was prepared by Aux Delices, a new shop in Riverside run by Debra Ponzek, who, as executive chef at Montrachet in Manhattan for seven years, earned the highest praise for her elegant cooking. Take-out food is hardly new, but in recent years it has risen far above the fast-food level, with some restaurants and many shops providing dishes light years removed from burgers or egg rolls.

The artifacts disguise the building's origin as a produce warehouse with stables, but not completely. You can still see the well used to water the horses in the middle of the floor.

1995-12-29	Restaurants	Restaurant critics make lousy customers. We sneak into restaurants when they are too new, make five or six quick visits, and are not seen again for years. We have work to do, and we seldom visit restaurants for the sheer pleasure of eating out. But I won't wait three years before going back to Lobster Club. I'll be there soon, and on my own dime. I like the casual, easygoing personality of the room, the experimental nature of the food and the innovative wine list.

Say nothing and, at least in some cases, they'll approach it with an open mind, which is how I tried to approach the Saddle River Inn, the most popular restaurant in New Jersey, according to the 1995 Zagat Survey and other indicators."

1995-12-05	The Mac's High Road to the Internet	MACINTOSH users were stung by a recent report, paid for and supervised by the Microsoft Corporation, which concluded that Windows 95 users are more productive, more accurate and better looking than Macintosh or OS/2 users. The results seem to contradict a similar study conducted several years ago, paid for and supervised by Apple Computer Inc., which concluded that Macintosh operating system (Mac OS) users were more productive, more accurate and of higher moral character than Windows users.
1995-12-03	I Was a Victim of Data Base Mismanagement	THE 1990's have been touted in business as the decade of data base, or target, marketing. Many companies, put off by the high costs and inefficiency of mass marketing, have turned to a more focused approach aimed at attracting the likeliest customers, targeting campaigns to them once they're in the fold and often structuring loyalty programs to reward them for their patronage. The explosion of sophisticated computer software and highly refined data bases has been an essential handmaiden to this effort. One would think, then, that credit-card companies, whose use of customer-acquisition and transaction-building mailings is second to none, would be on top of their data base game. But a recent experience involving both American Express and Mastercard revealed that, sadly, such is not the case.

1995-11-22	Business Travel;Booking a hotel room right now in New York or London can prove a daunting task.	"OCCUPANCY rates have been unusually robust -- between 80 percent and 90 percent -- at New York and London hotels this fall. The recovering global economy is stimulating travel to the two business capitals; lower hotel room taxes, the United Nations' 50th anniversary celebration and a visit by Pope John Paul II have also helped fill beds in New York. Both cities are expected to become even more crowded with sightseers and shoppers as the Christmas season draws near. 

     This is good news for the Sheratons, Hiltons and Four Seasons of the world. But it's not such good news for the executive who unexpectedly must travel to either city before the end of the year and find a hotel room."
1995-11-22	Seeking the Next Gold Rush	Wells Fargo & Company knows something about how to rise above a dying business. It was, after all, founded in 1852 as a stagecoach line, carrying eager prospectors to California's gold rush. By World War I, the company had transformed one of its sidelines -- gold storage -- into a thriving San Francisco-based banking business. Now Wells Fargo is reinventing itself again. Its industry is under siege -- too many banks, too much business lost to mutual funds and other rivals. But while its competitors respond by merging into coast-to-coast giants, Wells is, in many ways, shrinking.
1995-11-21	Leasing as One Means To Avert Obsolescence	TO buy, or not to buy: that is the question. Personal computers are notorious for having a half-life of about two years.

In households with children the half-life is closer to six months.

1995-11-12	A Small and Cozy Spot in Irvington	"FESTOONED with strings of pinlights, the canopy and facade of this cozy little restaurant sparkles like a beacon in the dark. Inside, candle lamps glow  prettily in shuttered windows in dark green. and pictures of woodlands and, appropriately, edibles line walls that are not hung with a wreathed mirror. A platform edged by a brass railing runs the length of the restaurant and lends further interest to the small space, which, nonetheless, has a great deal of charm. 

     We had mixed experiences dining at Stefini. Generally speaking, a weeknight dinner proved laudable; dinner on a weekend, with another chef, was carelessly prepared. But either way, spinach salad, an old favorite here, kept its high rating. Gently wilted under the warmth of grilled mushrooms, the young greens arrived topped with a bit of mild goat cheese. And large juicy shrimps were the  focus of a shrimp cocktail, predictable but satisfying."

It should not come as a surprise that the 30-year-old co-owner and chef, Danforth Houle, who has worked at Bouley, the Quilted Giraffe and the River Cafe, most recently cooked at Jean-Claude and Caffe Lure, two small downtown restaurants owned by Jean-Claude Iacovelli that set the standard for inventive, affordable bistros.

1995-09-24	How the Propeller Heads Stole the Electronic Future	"If you want an arbitrary date for the burial of the 500-channel dream, Aug. 9, 1995, will do just fine. On that morning, the public had its first crack at buying stock in the year-old Netscape Communications Corporation, which makes software that helps people navigate the Internet and set up ""sites"" that Net surfers can visit. What happened next is already the stuff of high-tech legend. The offering price of $28 per share shot up within minutes to a vertiginous $75 until finally settling at $58, a price that valued the as-yet-profitless company at wellover $2 billion. A month later, it was trading at about $53. The initial news reports focused on the instant millionaires at Netscape, including a 24-year-old computer programmer, Marc Andreessen, who emerged from the stock offering with that all-important first $58 million. But the real significance of the event was not that another bunch of propeller heads had joined the ranks of the super-rich. Aug. 9 marked the moment when Wall Street finally realized what had been becoming increasingly apparent to computer users: a set of highly technical but reliably standardized communications protocols known as the Internet had established itself as the real key to the electronic future. That future would be made not by silver-haired telephone- and cable-company executives in Denver, New York and Washington, building an empire around a golden goose called pay-per-view television, but by companies like Netscape and their customers."

1995-09-10	Quiet Weekend Spot in Litchfield County	WEST CORNWALL GRILL, tucked into a cozy enclave across from the defunct train station in West Cornwall, is a work in progress. While the rating Good is applicable today, this small, unpretentious place has the culinary potential to be Very Good indeed. The chef, Richard McCarty, was once at the West Street Grill in Litchfield, so he knows what he is about. And the new owner, Laura McDonald, may be able to straighten out some inconsistencies. The dining area, formerly a biker bar, has been expanded and reconfigured little by little. The decor is charmingly modest with white lace cafe curtains, dark-stained post and beam construction and hanging plants plus fresh garden flowers at each well-napped table.
1995-09-08	Restaurants	The weather may indicate otherwise. The calendar may disagree. But anybody who lives in New York City knows that Labor Day is the unofficial end of summer. As your tan fades, the only sensible thing to do is celebrate the city. In the next couple of months, dozens of restaurants will open, many of them with wonderful chefs at the helm: Anne Rosenzweig (Arcadia), David Walzog (Arizona 206), Matthew Kenney (Matthew's), Gary Robins (Aja), Antoine Bouterin (Le Perigord) and Jean-Jacques Rachou (La Cote Basque) are all planning to open new restaurants in the fall. But while you're waiting for these new ventures, let me suggest a visit to Nobu, a remarkable restaurant that epitomizes the energy of the city at this exact moment.

1995-09-03	Alpine Style Plus Gargantuan Servings	GLOCKENSPIEL in Higganum evokes the style of a Swiss Alpine lodge, with ceramic mugs and steins hung from high rafters plus a profusion of cuckoo clocks, red and white ceramic mushrooms and gnomes. And indeed, for this small restaurant features the cuisine of three mountain places: Bavaria and Austria as well as Switzerland. There are also a few French and Italian specialties on the large menu, but we fared best when we stuck to the Alpine heights. Our old Swiss favorite, rosti, was excellent: a beautifully browned potato cake shredded and fried with bits of bacon on top, though it was too filling a dish for an appetizer.
1995-08-30	Being Biggest Is No Big Deal For Citicorp	It is certainly no surprise to John S. Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, that his bank will no longer be the largest in the United States. In recent remarks to reporters, Mr. Reed cracked that if Richard M. Rosenberg, the chief executive of the BankAmerica Corporation, made one more acquisition, the San Francisco bank would leap from second to first. The name is different, but the outcome for Mr. Reed is the same. The combination announced Monday between the Chase Manhattan Corporation and the Chemical Banking Corporation would create a bank with $297 billion in assets, jumping ahead of Citicorp at $257 billion.

Noah's has been a local hangout for many years. In recent times, though, it has acquired a fresher edge, making it an even better choice than in years past and better value than some of its fancier neighbors. Seafood, usually premium-priced elsewhere, is a fairly priced staple.

The system would let a couple pay their phone bill by sending a payment to the telephone company over electronic mail, or they could send an electronic check to a child for a birthday present. A person or company receiving an electronic check could immediately deposit it in a bank, also via electronic mail."

The salesman, she said, assured her that she could try the device at no charge by writing a check for it that would not be cashed for two weeks. But when she asked for a refund a week later, she was told that the check had been cashed and that she could not get a refund.

The venture, called Smartcash, plans to issue what are called ""stored value"" or ""electronic purse"" cards. Customers would be able to load money onto these cards, say $20 or $50, at automated teller machines or by calling their banks with specially equipped telephones. That money then could be deducted, even at stores and at locations that typically do not take credit or debit cards, like vending machines, pay phones and mass transit carriers, which would be equipped with Smartcash devices."

For the moment, the perquisites of corporate power -- the artwork, the dark wood paneling, the executive dining room with views of the harbor -- offer little comfort. Golub's cigarettes, one after another, create a darkening cloud as he zeros in on his bitter rival, Visa.

To him, chief executive of American Express, the Visa commercials repeatedly attacking his company are fingernails forever scratching on a blackboard. He can practically see them in his sleep: in one, Wolfgang Puck, the prominent restaurateur, scowls at the mere mention of American Express, as if he has just been served rancid shrimp. On the air now for 10 years, the series of commercials featuring numerous retailers hammers home the idea that many merchants won't accept the American Express card. So Golub has twice sued Visa."

So, on a recent Saturday, as they slipped out of the house and left their 1-year-old triplets in the care of his mother and a 14-year-old nephew, one might have thought they were going to the beach or a matinee.

Not even close. The couple was headed for the downtown Chicago office of Barbara Fowler, president of Financial Planning Associates of Hyde Park. When they got there, as they waited for the coffee to brew, they gave voice to their fears about the financial future. ""It's really scary and depressing,"" said Ms. Markland, 41. Mr. Markland, 40, nodded. ""We really need a plan,"" he said."

1995-07-09	Lending New Force to the Term Eclectic	"STAMFORD'S restaurant row has spilled over from Summer Street into Park Place, where the newest addition is a modern, gallery-like space with a pared-back look: wood floors, colorful abstract art on sponge-painted oyster-white walls. ""Eclectic cuisine"" states the Park Place menu, and it is, featuring dishes and ingredients from Japan, Mexico, Peru, Italy and France, among others. For example, a generously packed shrimp quesadilla came with smoked Gouda cheese, a twist that gave the Mexican appetizer a new kick. Adorned with sour cream and a chunky, sharply flavored guacamole and salad greens, this was a delicious starter."
1995-07-02	"DINING OUT;
American Cuisine and Decor in Pawling"	"RESTAURANT history is filled with fresh ideas gone stale. The light touch in the kitchen becomes fixed; the concept becomes dated; the decor frays. Then from sheer ennui, all parties involved seem to agree it is time to close.

But sometimes none of this happens. On the border of lower Dutchess County, the Fine Foods Cafe, now in its fourth year, continues to surprise, to re-invent itself. The decor is a mite pared down from its original whimsy -- we miss the frog candlesticks, the ficus with the beehive -- and a few tables have been added. Sleek paintings (of food) have replaced framed prints and plaques of homey wisdom. But witty touches like the mysterious clothes-pinned clothesline disappearing over the southeast partition of the dining room and the American flag waving merrily in the breeze of an air-conditioner will bring a smile, as will the sign prohibiting whining, although there is not likely to be much of that here. The sure hand that once furnished the place seems to be choosing still."
1995-07-02	90's Cuisine in a 19th-Century Setting	TAVERN ON MAIN looks as if it has been around since Revolutionary War days, but in fact it's a new addition to Westport -- and a welcome one. The building is indeed vintage 1810, and has evolved from farmhouse to girls' school to the town's original ice cream parlor. The last occupant was Chez Pierre, long a local landmark, more for its cozy atmosphere than its food.
1995-07-02	Mechants of Debt	ON Wall Street, a small army of computer jockeys keeps busy culling mounds of market data in search of hidden treasure. Using complicated statistical models, these quantitative analysts, or quants, try to sniff out undervalued securities, profitable currency plays and the like. Here, on Kearny Street, the quants at Providian Bancorp are busy, too. Their computer screens are sifting a different kind of data, about the borrowing habits of credit card users. But their quarry is just as rich a trove as Wall Street's: middle- and lower-income consumers who want, or need, to borrow a lot of money and are the least inclined to shop for the best terms.

1995-06-24	Business Digest	"U.S. and Japan Extend Trade Talks Over Autos Japanese and American trade negotiators in Geneva agreed to extend their bargaining sessions over the Clinton Administration's threatened sanctions on Japanese luxury cars through the weekend. Negotiators reported minimal progress in a session that focused on how Japanese auto makers could increase their purchase of American parts without explicitly agreeing to a numerical target or its equivalent.

We were seeking directions to the Tuscany Grill in Middletown. Well, the opera house looks more like a 1930's movie theater and Plaza Middlesex would have been easier for out-of-towners to find if we had been told the actual College Street address. Nits, nits. In spite of this, Tuscany Grill turned out to be a winning surprise, from its high ceilings, balcony, ochre walls with terra cotta and slate blue trim and decorative plasterwork, to its understated Italian menu."
1995-06-14	First Data to Acquire Archrival in a $6.6 Billion Deal	The First Data Corporation agreed yesterday to a $6.6 billion takeover of the First Financial Management Corporation, its archrival in the rapidly growing business of credit card transaction processing. The merger would combine two of the country's largest independent processors of those transactions for banks and retail merchants. And the new company would be well positioned in the evolving field of so-called electronic commerce -- the shift away from the use of cash and checks as a form of payment for goods and services in favor of credit cards, debit cards and other media that transfer assets in flashes of electronic data.
1995-06-11	"DINING OUT;
Intrigue, American Style, in Port Chester"	"A PROBLEM with highly designed or theme restaurants is how to maintain diners' interest after the surprise of that restaurant's uniqueness. After the initial round of both formal and casual positive reviews, the cutting edge is sometimes dulled, and fickle diners are inclined to adopt the ""been there, done that"" attitude. Some places fall into complacent repetition, others re-invent their dishes in ever escalating self-parody, all the time wondering at the cooling interest of their clientele. But Two Moons, we are happy to report, seems fresh and healthy and thriving in its post-honeymoon stage.

The decor continues to delight and is almost reason enough to dine here. Sandy-beige walls etched with primitive figures and dramatically placed polished stone buffaloes, feathered artifacts and ancient-looking Indian pottery are only a part of the carefully conceived details that make up this eyeful."
1995-06-11	Sauces With Flavor, Take Out or Eat In	TAKE-OUT food has been part of American life for so long now, it is hard to think that anyone could give it a new twist. But two new Fairfield County Mexican taquerias, one in Stamford, the other in Westport, show that there is a new dimension to take-out and at the same time demonstrate what a little ingenuity can do to make eating-in agreeable and comfortable as well.
1995-06-04	Good, and 'Bad' for You	"THEY aren't into the food pyramid here,"" says a friend, eyeing the menu at Quilty's in Princeton. 

     It's true. Not since I had breakfast in the Smithfield Market in London have  I seen this much ""bad stuff"" (sausage, lamb chops, grilled medallions of pork).  It's comforting, really, to find a restaurant that, nutritionally speaking, has  the courage to do the wrong thing."
1995-06-04	Peaks and Valleys in an Old Roadhouse	CUCINA'S full name is North Fork House Cucina. But East End diners who do not know that will still be instantly aware that they are not in the Hamptons. North Fork dining spots are generally less expensive, sophisticated and predictable than those to the south. Cucina fits the pattern. This Greenport newcomer has replaced Porky's, a 45-year institution. Much of the old look is intact. The barroom, a classic with a wraparound mahogany bar dating from 1949, is a step back into another era. The dining room, wood-paneled with flagstone fireplaces, is reminiscent of 1950's recreation rooms.

1995-05-28	Simple French Fare, Swirling Stream	"A FIRST visit to Brookside Bistro, a block from the covered bridge in West Cornwall, produced an acute attack of nostalgia. This same frame house, with a screened-in deck in the rear, overlooking a swirling stream (actually the Housatonic River at a narrow point), has been home to at least two restaurants in the recent past: the Deck and Freshfields. While the interior look is casual -- with cozy dining alcoves, banquettes and taped jazz background music, and the menu is deceptively simple and straight forward -- Brookside Bistro is considerably more than just a run-of-the-roadside eatery. The more is the bistro food, the inspiration of a talented chef, Guy Birster, from Dijon. Thus a dish listed on the menu simply as ""brie"" turned out to be a piping hot sarcophagus of beautifully browned, crisp puff pastry encasing melt-in-the-mouth brie, the pastry at rest on an exquisite leek cream sauce."
1995-05-24	Real Estate; Wilmington, Del., gets a shot in the arm from office construction for two big banking companies.	TWO big banking companies are generating a small burst of office construction in downtown Wilmington. Both plan to relocate operations from the suburbs. One of the companies, the MBNA America Bank, a big issuer of Visa and Mastercard credit cards, has nearly completed the first of two towers on 11th Street, the main boulevard into the city from Interstate 95. The tower is in Rodney Square, a prestigious office location.
1995-05-22	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; The direct marketing industry takes a look at the perils of interactive technology.	"AS interactive marketing becomes more prevalent, it seems to make sense that the direct marketing industry would benefit. After all, isn't interactive marketing just a high-tech way to provide product information or make a sale? How much difference can there be between using an on-line computer service or a CD-ROM and using a telephone or a letter proclaiming ""You may already be a winner!""? Yet as direct marketers gather for a big annual conference, answering those questions is not as simple as it appears."

She was right about the steak -- it is terrific -- but wrong to steer anyone away from the pasta. Again and again, you try to kick the pasta habit, especially in non-Italian restaurants and ones that seem more interested in fashion than in food. And then you're confronted with a bowl of linguine so flavorful that you end up back where you started, convinced that pasta will always be your No. 1 love."

1995-05-21	In Bethel, a Beer Garden in Miniature	"AT an outpost of Germany in Bethel called Helga's, dinner is about as close to a year-round Oktoberfest as Connecticut gets. Enter the front door of the small house by the roadside any weekend evening, and one is likely to be blown away by the exuberant oompah tones of an accordion played by a smiling musician in Tyrolean jacket and hat, while rousing songs are belted out by the owner, Helga Roth, in her native Rhinelander costume, with guests joining in on the choruses. We went to Helga's for the German food, a rarity in Connecticut restaurants. The entertainment was a double-edged surprise. For one thing, the four tiny dining rooms were packed and the tables were uncomfortably close together. Then, too, the decibel level, with nonstop accordion music, singing, dancing and shouts of ""Hip, Hip"" made conversation almost impossible. Tete-a-tete dining is not what Helga's is about."

I'm not saying I'd order the cod with broccoli florets for $6.50 instead of the pesto pizza or the wonderful white clam pie or the special pizza of the day with portobello mushrooms, pine nuts and sun-dried tomatoes. I'd order the fish with any of the above, because as pizzas go, these aren't just excellent. They're light."

Biscotti Food Company in Ridgefield, at the upper (ground) level of a historic building, has an anteroom that triples as a coffee bar, wine bar and take-out food area with a glass-fronted display case. The low-ceilinged dining room combines vintage wood floors and post and beam construction with white walls, a display of antique tools (the space was once a blacksmith shop) and country chairs and tables. A plethora of fake flowers and plants adds color, though a few real plants or fresh flowers might be more attractive.
1995-05-07	"RESTAURANTS;
New World French"	"I CAN only imagine the joy of the first reviewer who stumbled upon Chez Madeleine. She (or he) must have been dazzled not only by the veal, but also by the charm of the room, which is so Old World Gallic it's almost tacky, as some of the best neighborhood restaurants in Paris are. Here are mirrors, fake brick and more accordion music than you've heard since the days of Charles de Gaulle.

It's hard not to love this place, and reviewers do, tripping over one another to give it stars and accolades since it opened in November 1988. That it was next to a billiard parlor and around the corner from the Sock Company Mill Outlet only made the discovery seem more exciting. Certainly people never thought of Bergenfield as the foie gras capital, or of New Jersey as the land of escargots."

It's not the most extraordinary Chinese food in New Jersey, but the restaurant that serves that (stay tuned) isn't a place to take the children on Sunday night for dumplings. Ivangie is.

Indeed, the reason that conventional photo graphy is expected to survive the coming era of digital imaging is that the grains of silver halide in a negative can capture orders of magnitude more information than even the most advanced computer chip. More information means that chemical-based images can be enlarged and still appear crisp and color-saturated, while those captured electronically quickly grow fuzzy and indistinct if blown up much larger than a computer screen.

1995-04-07	Restaurants	One night four gorgeous women walked into Zut! wearing huge fluffy pink hats that looked exactly like cotton candy. Every head in the restaurant turned to watch as they were seated at a front table. Those pink clouds were so mesmerizing that everyone in the long, dark room waited to see if the women would remove them. We waited all evening and when they finally got up and left, hats still firmly anchored to their heads, a collective sigh zipped around the room. This display was particularly impressive, given the difficulty of making an entrance at Zut! The fabulously silly room captures most of the attention. The eye is first caught by the animals cavorting over the circular bar and then bounces to the chandeliers made of giant straw hats. By the time it discovers the musical giraffes, dancing rabbits and bridge-playing penguins on the wallpaper, it is hooked. There is so much to discover: sombrero mirrors, copper monkey panels, gold animals twinkling on the ceiling like urban constellations. This is one of the most playful spaces in New York City.
1995-04-02	Remaking Lobster In the East 60's	HOSTERIA FIORELLA ** (212) 838-7570; 1081 Third Avenue, near 64th Street; $$$; all major cards Rustic murals, mirrors, hanging quilts and a mismatch of tables characterize this cheerful Italian seafood grill. As for the food, the kitchen turns out a fresh and sprightly mix of well-prepared dishes. A nice way to start is with little pizzas, which have ultrathin, brittle crusts and come with tomatoes, basil and mozzarella; shrimp, goat cheese and bacon; or radicchio, pesto, tomatoes and pepperoni. Also good are the seafood chili with squid, sausage, shrimp and beans, and the shellfish platter that holds scallops, shrimp, salmon pastrami, smoked trout and more. Main-course choices include linguine with lobster in a fra diavolo sauce; capellini combined with striped bass, shrimp and zucchini in garlic and olive oil; roasted mahi-mahi in a clay pot, served with portobello mushrooms and potatoes; and grilled salmon with tomato sauce, soft polenta and fried leeks. (Review: 7/24/92) JO JO *** (212) 223-5656; 160 East 64th Street; $$; all major cards With his compelling cooking style, built on low-fat flavored oils and fresh vegetable juices, Jean-Georges Vongerichten keeps luring them into his bistro. The main dining room is warm, with dark wood wainscotting, yellow walls, beveled mirrors and red banquettes. Mr. Vongerichten has just begun his spring menu, which includes appetizers of foie gras terrine studded with green peppercorns and served with a salad of French string beans; grilled shrimp enhanced by a spiced carrot juice with Thai lime leaves, and seared tuna with a soybean coulis and spring rolls. Among main courses are a lasagna of lobster layered with truffles and vegetables; red-pepper-crusted lamb cutlet with its ragout of white beans and vegetables, and roasted chicken with ginger, green olives and coriander juice.

The food is fresh and simple, prepared with skill and flair. Some current starters are a salad of smoked duck breast; stuffed calamari with a scallop mousse over mixed greens; seared sweetbreads seasoned with a raspberry vinaigrette, and snails in garlic butter with parsley. Among the entrees are a monkfish ragout with lardons in a port wine sauce; napoleon of salmon and fish mousse ringed by a red caviar sauce; duck confit; braised lamb with truffles and apple compote, and sauteed fillet of snapper and shrimp with a mango sauce.

For appetizers, there are tuna tartar with fennel and a caraway toast of green olive tapenade; roast quail with white raisins and hazelnuts; wild mushroom risotto; grilled spicy octopus with a white bean salad, and a soup of baked squash with yogurt and chickpea croutons. Entrees include char-grilled lobster with curry leaves complemented by a sweet carrot risotto; stewed lamb shank with Moroccan spices and dried fruits, served with a vegetable couscous; baked chicken in lemon with olives and pignoli, and grilled Black Angus steak with mashed potatoes and spinach.

A piano bar, near the entrance, done in brick, marble and rose-tinted wood, is a good place to wait if your companion is fashionably late. One might begin with a potent beef and capon broth with caramelized onions and Gruyere crisps; seared sweetbreads with artichokes, pea shoots and carrots in a light tomato sauce with parsley oil, or house-cured salmon with a kick of mustard oil, served with potatoes and roasted beets. Among the main courses, roast duck is served with roasted beets and figs; a grilled loin of venison is accompanied by a ragout of vegetables and glazed chestnuts, and the rack of lamb comes with its spicy vegetable tagine with preserved lemons over couscous. (Review: 3/1/91; article: 1/17/92) SUSHI-HATSU *** (212) 371-0238; 1143 First Avenue, near 62d Street; $$$$; American Express, Diners' Club This modest-looking Japanese restaurant with a sushi bar up front and neighborly tables in the back offers a remarkable quality and selection of sushi and sashimi that is better sampled at the bar. Highly recommended are the marble-size octopuses; toro, the rich belly of bluefin tuna; cubed Spanish mackerel with scallions, and sliced yellowtail. Other selections include scallops; poached shrimp; tai, a sweet, lean fish with flesh so soft it seems to melt into the rice on which it's served; large, bright pearls of salmon roe; golden chunks of herring roe, and sea urchin.

For starters, try the barbecued squab with a corn and foie gras cake, the tartar of tuna and salmon with osetra caviar, or the sauteed sea scallops, which are coupled with a taste of beef bourguignon. Entreess include roasted striped bass with a crab meat strudel and artichokes, pan-seared salmon with ginger and cracked pepper, grilled lobster with curried fries and roast chicken in an onion crust served with a potato pancake.

1995-03-26	Creative Zoning for the 'Chateau Country'	A secluded mansion in the heart of this wealthy Brandywine Valley community is undergoing a $1 million conversion to an office building under a recent land-use amendment that allows significant properties to be used as commercial space while retaining residential zoning. The zoning change, passed late last year by the New Castle County Council, seeks to deal creatively with the plethora of great estates that have come on the market in the last five years.
1995-03-21	Visa Will Put A Microchip In New Card	"Visa International said yesterday that it planned to introduce a new type of plastic card, embedded with a microchip, that is intended to replace bills and coins for small purchases. Unlike debit cards, which transfer money electronically from customers' bank accounts, the new ""electronic purse"" cards will have an amount of money stored on them. They are similar to the cards issued for some telephone and mass transit systems, but are designed to be used interchangeably in pay phones, vending machines, taxi cabs and for other small purchases."

Over the last year, an obscure computer program designed to create card numbers has begun circulating on major on-line computer services, like America Online and the myriad electronic bulletin boards around the country.

The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh is making a variation on that offer with its unusual Cornerstone Mastercard, which promises to let you indulge now and get back all the finance charges you pay over the years.

1995-03-19	Northern Italian at the Westport Station	WHEN the modest little storefront restaurant called Maria's Trattoria opened in Norwalk some years ago, no one could have guessed it would spawn four offshoots. But entering Osteria della Stazione, across from the railroad station in Westport, was like going home. The Osteria has kept the same configuration as its predecessors: a bar area at the entrance, a small dining room with two large niches for floral displays, and banquettes beneath a large mirror. And, like the rest of the Maria family, the Osteria features an Italian menu that highlights northern Italian favorites, with several pleasing surprises.

It is one of the more pleasant spots for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. The gratifying, straightforward fare includes soups, salads, sandwiches and a selection of hot-plate dinners. For starters there are fried, cornmeal-coated oysters with remoulade, shrimp and chicken sate with a peanut sauce, and a vegetable plate combining grilled zucchini, roast peppers and fresh mozzarella. Salads include grilled chicken with sun-dried tomato, arugula and radicchio, and mixed greens with warm goat cheese croutons and shallot mustard vinaigrette. Sandwiches include roast turkey breast on focaccia with cranberry mayonnaise, smoked bacon, sprouts and tomato, and grilled salmon on whole grain bread with a dill and caper sauce, cucumbers and marinated fennel. Among the entrees are grilled leg of lamb with a potato-horseradish gratin, and meatloaf with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. ($25 and Under: 2/13/93)

The real focus is the beguiling, inventive Asian-accented cooking with spices and flavors borrowed from China, Japan, Thailand and India. Provocative starters include spicy tuna tartar nestled in crispy rice cakes with avocado and daikon and blended with sesame oil, cilantro and lime juice; grilled squab coated with a Chinese anise-flavored five-spice powder, then drizzled with chili sauce and balanced by the sweetness of caramelized mangoes, and seared scallops with chili oil, jicama and tangerine sections on a bed of fried noodles. For main courses the steamed lobster over basmati rice wrapped in roasted eggplant comes in a spicy Penang curry; giant prawns and clams are served in a coconut-based Thai curry over jasmine rice, and grilled lamb is flavored with cumin and coriander and accompanied by a zesty chili-and-potato samosa.

1995-03-12	Markets Rise and Fall, but He's Always Looking Up	"TO the Manhattan financial astrologer Arch Crawford, 1995 is slated to be a grim untidy year: plenty of earthquakes and a stock market heading south.

Green plasticized banquettes, wooden tabletops, a leaf-pattern industrial-type carpet, spotlights in the ceiling, all suggest low budget, low maintenance, and low prices to match. What sets Emerald City apart is its short menu, which is partly Middle Eastern, partly nondoctrinaire vegetarian."

Ristorante, featuring northern Italian food in a small, quietly handsome setting of beige-tiled floor, beige-sponged walls, well-spaced tables and soft romantic lighting. In the last couple of years, it seems every new Italian restaurant has called itself northern. But at Per Bacco!, the label is accurate. The stage for a promising meal was set with the arrival of crusty bread and a tiny dish of luscious sun-dried tomatoes in extra-virgin olive oil. Other spreads -- red and yellow roasted pepper strips, an onion ""jam"" -- were equally delicious."
1995-02-19	Saturday Night Fever: Noise That Unnerves	"LAST Saturday night, when the kick drum of one of the alternativerockgrungemetal bands began reverberating inside my skull and the bass line oscillated up and down my spine, I called the 13th Precinct. As usual these Saturday nights, the officer was friendly: he told me there had already been a number of complaints about the Pit, on East 15th Street, and that they'd send a car over. He unctuously suggested that I get involved in community organizations. Monday afternoon, for the first time, I descended into the Pit, a narrow duplex set somewhere between a crack house and the fancy brownstone of the New York Correctional Society on a block facing the Con Ed Building. I was in a surly mood, but when the bartender turned from watching A & E to say, ""Hi, Doc, what's your pleasure?"" I began to lose some of my edge. It was Cindy Hawkins, an acquaintance from the nabe."
1995-02-17	Restaurants	New York steakhouses were once rough and tumble places where the portions were huge, the seats were cramped, the noise was raucous and the waiters rude. The only people wearing suits were those who worked there and everybody liked it like that. But times change. While the old institutions soldier on in their unpretentious fashion, the new places have all gone posh. Consider Morton's, where the waiters entertain their well-dressed patrons with a fashion show of steak styles, displaying the uncooked meat with appropriate patter. Or Ruth Chris's carpeted salon, where polite and pretty servers are trained in decorum. But neither of those new restaurants has anything on West 63d Street Steakhouse with its leopard-skin-print rug. A glass-enclosed private elevator whisks patrons up to the restaurant, where they are surrounded by mahogany paneling and beautifully framed art. The place is as cozy as a millionaire's library.
1995-02-12	All Veggies and Grain, and Tasty Too	FOR the novice, eating in a totally vegetarian restaurant can be as daunting as the first encounter with a foreign menu without benefit of English subtitles. This may be why It's Only Natural in Middletown provides a glossary with its menu. And it's very helpful when we encounter on the menu terms like T.V.P (textured vegetable protein, a soy product), arame/hiziki (delicate black threads with a fishy taste), kombu/wakame (members of the kelp family, in dried strips) or rice dream (rice milk, sweetened and frozen).
1995-02-05	Greek Food and Unassuming Charm	TO say Athena in Bellmore is a Greek storefront is like calling the Empire State a tall building. Yes, the newcomer next to a Chinese takeout on Merrick Road clearly fits the definition of storefront. But its exceptional food and charming look incorporating classical architectural features and masses of green plants set it apart. Cream-colored walls are outlined with a white chair rail in the Greek key pattern. Near the ceiling a wallpaper frieze of Greek vases encircles the room. Doric and Ionic columns are everywhere, in pictures, as plant stands and as wood carvings affixed to the wall. Tables with the look of green marble mesh with the Hellenic style.
1995-02-03	Restaurants	I popped a crisp tiny poori into my mouth and immediately experienced a whole range of contrasting sensations: first came the crunch of the fried shell and then the softness of the potato filling. Then my teeth closed with a snap on the yellow noodlelike shreds on top. Next I became aware of the tang of the yogurt and the sweet sourness of the tamarind sauce. Finally, at the very end, the heat of the spices kicked in. It was one small mouthful, but to me it was the taste of India. It was a shock. Salaam Bombay looks much like every other upscale Indian restaurant in New York City. The room is large and pleasant and in the daytime the airy front of the dining room is occupied by a lunch buffet that promises mountains of food for $8.95. The buffet looks inviting enough, but it holds the ubiquitous Indian dishes: pakoras, tandoori chicken, rice pullau, mango chutney. In the back, a man behind a glass window methodically pulls breads out of the tandoor in a spotless kitchen. A woman in a sari circulates, smiling graciously. It all seems very familiar.

Blue denim shirts on cheerful, well-trained staffers add to the Western look.

1995-01-27	Restaurants	For at least some of this season, San Pietro, a wildly popular, two-and-a-half-year-old midtown sibling of Sistina on the Upper East Side, was decorated with baskets of eggplants and cauliflower and plates piled high with tomatoes. But something was wrong with the picture. Those tomatoes were plump and pale, and come to think of it, who wants to eat tomatoes in the middle of January? And wouldn't you think somebody might have remembered to take the cellophane off the cauliflower? Even though it was not straight from the farm, the illusion of freshness is always welcome.

An Unexpected Place for a Sushi Bar"	"TO travelers whipping along Route 22 through Watchung, Ajian still resembles the hot-dog stand it once was. But a closer look reveals a trim and modern little Japanese restaurant and sushi bar marked with red lanterns. The glass-fronted Somerset County eating place, just west of the Ethan Allen furniture store, opened in November.

Instead of frankfurters, diners who drop in these days will find the Japanese fast-food equivalent, yakitori, the grilled kebabs. And rather than french fries, there are intriguing dishes like agedashi tofu, tender cubes of deep-fried bean curd in a wine and soy sauce-spiked broth with grated ginger."

In fact, the sense of familiarity is real, for this small, spotless storefront Thai restaurant is the former Fork and Spoon. But not just the name is new, so are the partnership, the kitchen staff and the higher prices. The new menu is fairly small, with some Chinese dishes layered among the Thai ones.
1995-01-13	Inside Art	"Didn't Leave Home When Eli Broad flew to New York in November to attend Sotheby's sale of contemporary art, he didn't leave home without his American Express card. In fact, the Los Angeles collector used his little piece of plastic to buy Roy Lichtenstein's ""I . . . I'm Sorry,"" a painting from 1965-66, for which he paid $2.5 million. While the auction house, which has been accepting the American Express card (but not Mastercard or Visa) since September, does not generally discuss the payment methods of its clients, Mr. Broad's office confirmed that he had bought the painting with his American Express card. William Ruprecht, Sotheby's managing director for North and South America, said this was certainly ""not a typical transaction and not something Sotheby's sees on a daily basis."" (The painting was the most expensive work in the sale.)"
1995-01-13	Restaurants	Enough to make people talk. People talk about the food at Aja. One night, I was sitting on one of the sofas that surround the bar, waiting for my guests to arrive. It was cozy there with the big Art Deco fixture overhead shedding just enough light to allow the woman across from me to read a magazine. Next to her, a man sat mumbling over a book about saltwater fish, occasionally angling the book to catch some light from the chandelier above the bar. When his companion arrived, he put the book down, ordered a martini and began discussing his last meal at the restaurant. By the time he was finished describing five-spice grilled squab and steamed lobster with Penang curry, his friend was insisting on staying for dinner. To do that they had to leave the warmth of the bar and move to the far reaches of the large open room. Aja, an oddly decorated space, offers a new definition of the term eclectic. Part Victorian, part Art Moderne, part modern, the barn of a room is an uncomfortable mush of styles that combine open ducts and chandeliers. That's fine with me, but I wish the Shaker element were not the chairs (hard and uncomfortable) and the modern element were not the sound level (extremely high). Most of all, I wish the decor did not try so hard to compete with the food.
1995-01-10	Mastercard to Develop On-Line Standard	Joining a stampede of companies that hope to profit from shopping on computer networks, Mastercard International said yesterday that it would develop standards for its cards to be used on the Internet.

1995-01-08	"DINING OUT;
A Busy Place for Italian-American Fare"	"FROM the outside, it doesn't look like much -- another strip-mall Italian place on a busy thoroughfare -- but Primavera in West Orange is inscribed in many an Essex County diner's little black book. Its word-of-mouth popularity with a mature, affluent-looking crowd makes it tough to get either a table or a parking space, even on slower weeknights.

After tasting more than two dozen dishes on recent visits -- a cross section of the Italian-American menu -- we found that for every terrific dish, there was one that was not up to par. And that is what keeps the rating for this convivial, family-operated restaurant below its potential.

Pasta and seafood dishes are winners, while a few entrees, particularly veal preparations, leave something to be desired. Veal ortolana, for one, could be renamed veal Gucci, with its red and green salad topping and leathery breaded scaloppine. Portions are large, though, and the plate presentation is above average. Also, prices are not high. A complete dinner runs about $24, not counting tax, tip or wine. 

The snug dining area was recently expanded to 85 seats by taking over the former deli's space next door, but the tables are still jammed. Despite being on time for our reservation recently, our fivesome was kept waiting in the tiny foyer for 35 minutes. Better management of the front of the house would help.

Once people are seated, the personable, bantering waiters in black tie keep things moving. The specials, though, are described accurately only about half of the time and never with prices.

Among the specials, two excellent choices that appear frequently are the rock shrimp appetizer -- succulent morsels crusty with herbs and spices and reminiscent of ""Cajun popcorn"" -- and pasta with Manila clams. In the latter, a shower of the steamed baby deep-sea clams with green-tinged shells, at once sweet and briny, are tossed with al dente linguine in a garlicky broth.

A nice mix of young greens (misnamed ""Mesculine"" on the menu) in a good vinaigrette with shards of Parmesan outshines the dull Caesar salad, and tenderly plump escargots with shiitake mushrooms and toast points is a more successful combination than the one-note acidic brown sauce on sliced portobello mushrooms, which would be better left whole. Other starters include a trio of succulent shrimp with a tumble of white beans, and tortellini in brodo, meat-filled pasta afloat in a full-flavored broth.

In pollo balsamico, lightly sauteed chunks of boneless chicken with mushrooms are bathed in a very intense balsamic vinegar sauce. Penne, the quill-shape macaroni, tossed with sauteed eggplant cubes in a tomato and basil sauce with melted fontina cheese, is appealing.


Vegetables are included with most entrees, but a recommended side dish is the emerald-green spinach, only lightly sauteed, with a fragrant gloss of olive oil and cracklings of garlic.

Joseph Meli, the chef who operates Primavera with his wife, Antonia, cooked at Il Tulipano in nearby Cedar Grove before going out on his own here three years ago.

Except for the de rigueur tiramisu, richly satisfying in a sundae dish, and the imported fruit sorbets in their natural shells, most of the desserts are brought in from a New York bakery. Although a cheesecake was leaden, a custardy profiterole cake drizzled with chocolate will suit the sweet tooth at the table. 

The brief wine list contains a handful each of California, Italian and French bottles, like a Meridian chardonnay for $16 and a '91 Groth cabernet sauvignon for $26. There are off-list specials, like a 1988 Brunello di Montalcino for $40.

1995-01-01	Business Diary	"It Makes Perfect Sense to Be a Good Neighbor Looking at it from a coldly practical angle, this nation can't afford to have the Mexican economy fall apart. Just as a ramshackle house stains a whole neighborhood, a tattered Mexico would be a big headache for its mighty cousin to the north. So it made total sense last week when Washington decided to pump billions into Mexico to prop up the battered peso. And President Ernesto Zedillo soon saw the necessity of some falling on swords, accepting the resignation of his Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, whose prints were all over the currency mess. Mr. Zedillo also announced a drastic emergency plan, including deep concessions from labor, big spending cuts and a slowdown of economic growth. As it happens, Mr. Serra's replacement, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, tried in the fall to show the need for an orderly devaluation, but no one listened. They are now. Give and It Shall Be Taken From Britain, today's lesson: Never, ever underestimate the public's willingness to take full advantage of anything that's free. A mobile-phone company called Mercury One-2-One wanted a catchy promotion for its ""personal communications services"" -- it's among the first in the world to offer this radio-wave-based phone technology -- so it offered free calls on Christmas for new subscribers. What it no doubt figured on: customers merrily making a few calls to relatives, then getting back to the day's festivities. What it got: jammed lines, 10 times normal volume, 12-hour international calls, some people making 100 calls, others not able to get through at all. In short, chaos. Japan's Humbled Self-Image Japan strikes a bit less terror in American hearts these days, and even the Japanese admit that their mighty economic machine has been badly humbled. Just three years ago, 53 percent of Japanese said they expected Japan to lead the world economic pack for quite a while. A recent poll shows, though, that that's plummeted to 25 percent. And what's the next powerhouse? A big difference of opinion on that one -- fully a quarter of the Japanese, but a scant 4 percent of Americans, picked China. One feeling persists in Japan, though: 83 percent of Japanese believe their blue-collar workers work harder than Americans -- and that number's held pretty steady. Mr. Pataki Seems to Mean It George Pataki sent some powerful signals last week that he is dead serious about his economic vision for New York. First he named a new budget director, Patricia Woodworth, who as Michigan's budget director has zeroed in on cutting taxes and state spending. A key item on her resume: Michigan's move this year to end local schools' dependence on property taxes. She said that approach would be tough in New York, though. Mr. Pataki also found a Commissioner of Social Services in Mary Glass, who holds the same job in Westchester (she'll have to work fast; she's returning to that job in three months). On her watch, 60 percent of those on home relief were dropped for failing to work. The ship of state is clearly shaping up as a tight one. The West, Yes; the Coast, No It's really true. Though New Yorkers persist in thinking they are at the center of the universe, New York, alas, has suffered the indignity of falling behind Texas to be No. 3 on the state population list. But Census figures out last week also highlighted an interesting aspect of this nation's great tilt westward: it stops before it gets to the ocean. The big growth spurts are coming one or two states in from the West Coast, like Nevada, up 5.4 percent, and Arizona, up 3.3 percent. And how about California? Yes, it's still easily No. 1, but it now ranks just 35th in growth. The state's sour economy is clearly no draw these days. Mutual Funds: Doing Fine (So Far) The public made a startling discovery last year: mutual funds are not invincible. Investors scurried away from bond funds, but a sickly stock market couldn't stop stock funds from slogging ahead. True, the net $3 billion that flowed in in November was the lowest since 1991, but that marked the 49th straight month that more has come in than gone out -- easily the longest streak ever. Maybe people, even when gloomy, can't think of a better place to put their cash. Shoppers Always Show Up It makes no sense. Stores panic in early December, then run sales even before Christmas, and -- wonder of wonders! -- the hordes arrive. Don't retailers know that this nation's citizens are genetically programmed for holiday excess? They have to show up, always at the last minute. So it was that retailers, tallying it all up last week, found that sales weren't bad but profits were poor -- because of markdowns. One footnote: plastic was big. Visa and Mastercard both reported hefty increases in credit-card purchases. Maybe people are using cards more for their daily bread, but it could also spell empty stores now as people wrestle those Visa bills back to earth. Something Completely Different On New Year's Day, this page would be incomplete without a roundup of Top Stories of '94. On second thought, that's a dumb idea. Instead, here's an exclusive look at what will surely be the Top Story of '95: All the people who made money on derivatives (if billions were lost, billions had to be made, right?) will be overwhelmed by remorse and holiday spirit and send checks to Orange County. BRITS ZIP UP TMS. SQ.! It's called the zipper, that ribbon of lit-up news on the 43d Street end of Times Square. And even in an age when people get up-to-the-second news practically piped into their brains, the passing throng can easily be seduced into watching the headlines emerge, word * by * rolling * word. In 1928, soon after it was born, the zipper carried news of Hoover's victory, and with a few interruptions, it's been blinking ever since. But Newsday, which has run the billboard since 1986, pulled out recently, raising the possibility that zipper junkies would go headline-less come New Year's Eve. Relax. Last week Pearson, the British conglomerate that puts out The Financial Times and The Economist, picked up the lease. Senate to House: Drop Deal Newt Gingrich's sojourn in the land of big-bucks publishing was a brief one. Last week Bob Dole raised his powerful eyebrows at Mr. Gingrich's $4.5 million deal to write two books for a publisher owned by Rupert Murdoch, who happens to have regulatory business with Congress. Mr. Gingrich soon scrapped the deal, saying he'd take just a $1 advance and patiently await his royalties. He had to ""do what's good for the country,"" Mr. Gingrich said; even though it was a ""legal and ethical deal,"" he didn't want the new Congress ""to be slowed down or distracted,"" even for a second. David Bonior, the Michigan Democrat who is showing signs of being a feisty anti-Gingrich, said Mr. Gingrich ""finally got the message."" Insurance With a Difference Life insurance. It conjures images of endless mailings and sales pitches -- and it's the last thing people want to think about anyway. So selling it is tough, and many agents don't last. But a New York sales agent named Steven Genovese, prosecutors say, had a better idea. An indictment last week asserted that for years he presented phony applications, wrote bad checks for a few payments, and pocketed his commission -- perhaps half the first year's premium. If a policy's canceled, part of the commission should be returned, but that didn't happen this time -- and no procedure was in place to track such fraud. Agents can job-hop leaving barely a footprint. Even Mr. Genovese's lawyer admitted that the system ""could almost seduce people into fraudulent conduct."" A Bullet Too Far Well, David Keen decided last week that the world did not need, just yet, a bullet that not only pierces armor but splits into razorlike shards and does all sorts of nasty, nasty stuff. Mr. Keen, who heads an Alabama company called Signature Products, backed down after stiff police opposition to the company's bullet, which he says is needed because criminals often wear bulletproof vests. Of course, some people say that his bullet isn't even possible, that it's all a hoax, that he was helping the gun-control lobby more than anyone. The one thing that's certain: he got a lot of attention."
1994-12-30	Restaurants	"Walk in, past the dim bar where pretty people sit on chic stools, past the Malaysian stilt houses with their rope windows, to the waterfall in the back of the room. Tropical plants hug the walls, and music throbs as tall men wrapped in sarongs weave through the tables with feline grace. The room is dim, and the sultry air is perfumed with the mingled aromas of ginger, lemongrass and curry. When the owners of Penang Malaysia Cuisine, a wonderfully authentic Malaysian restaurant in Flushing, decided to take their act to SoHo, they left behind the harsh storefront lighting, the plastic tablecloths and the cash-only policy. They also abandoned the fish-head soup. Clearly, June and Stanley Cheah had more in mind than just opening an ethnic restaurant in an upscale area of Manhattan. They seem to have edited their menu to introduce their country's little-known cuisine in the most appealing fashion. Penang is the opposite of those Chinatown restaurants where hopeful diners are invariably told ""You won't like that"" when they order exotic dishes. The Cheahs want you to love their food, and since opening in early November they have done everything they can to see that you do."
1994-12-28	Even With Guilty Plea, Justice Official's Crimes and Motives Remain Enigma	Early last month, Webster L. Hubbell traveled to Arkansas to tell a few old friends that the embezzlement charges he had denied so vehemently for so long were actually true. But even now, three weeks after the former Associate Attorney General stood up in court to plead guilty to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from his former law firm, friends and former colleagues here and in Little Rock, Ark., are still wrestling with some mysteries. Why did he steal? Where did the money go? And how can they square the man they knew -- a Presidential confidant, whom even opponents called a man of integrity -- with the sloppy, almost brazen thefts he has admitted?
1994-12-28	Merchants Fear Fewer Sales Ahead	Even as retailers take final markdowns as they prepare to bring in new merchandise, they worry that 1995 is shaping up as a difficult year. The holiday selling season, which ended with a whimper on Saturday, was softer than many anticipated. And many merchants expect shoppers to suffer holiday hangovers nonetheless, when they begin receiving credit card bills next month.
1994-12-26	Retailers' Christmas Wishes Didn't Come True This Year	"The predictions of a strong holiday shopping season were apparently wishful thinking for many retailers, particularly in apparel. While the numbers will not begin to come out until tomorrow, the early indications are that the season's sales, while above last year's, have not been what retailers hoped for or stocked for. ""It's not been a happy season,"" said Edward Johnson, the retailing analyst who compiles the Johnson Redbook Service, which tracks sales."

At a Rebuilt Inn, a Choice of 28 Pastas"	"NEW owners are breathing renewed life -- and an Italian accent -- into the former Heslin House in the Morris County borough of Wharton. This fall a Dover physician, Dr. Robert Petrocelli, and his brother-in-law, Carlos Diaz, a former Manhattan chef, converted the two-story white clapboard building into an unpretentious, small-town friendly restaurant called Villa Vecchia.

Although the name is Italian for old country-house, and there is valet parking at the entrance, this is not a place for highfalutin appearances. Diners come in casual attire for the generally tasty Italian fare, the moderate prices and the folksy waitress service."
1994-12-18	Combating Credit Card Fraud	"THE last week of the holiday shopping season can be a tense time, with all the last-minute Johnnys and Janes jamming malls and shopping centers in search of that elusive gift. Shoppers are apt to be unusually distracted and forgetful, making them easy prey for thieves who commit credit card fraud, police and bank card officials said.

"" 'Tis the season to be jolly, but not to make the thieves jolly,"" said Charlie Petersen, vice president in Citibank MasterCard and Visa's antifraud division in New York City. His department conducts training programs for merchants, consumers and law enforcement officials around the country."
1994-12-18	Oysters Almost Every Way; More Please	THE latest restaurant to open in Greenwich is the Elm Street Oyster House, in former luncheonette space converted to a handsome cafe setting. A long bar (the only area where smoking is permitted) is followed by an equally long, narrow dining room with a deep blue-green hardwood floor, sea-blue seat covers on booths and piscine paintings on the walls. Though not large, the all-seafood menu offers enough intriguing choices to satisfy any seafood-starved visitor. We began by wolfing down raw littleneck clams and a dozen fresh oysters -- duos of Chesapeake, Malpeque, Kumomoto (the briny best), Chincoteague, Louisiana and bluepoint -- which came with a horseradish dip, a standard cocktail sauce and a tangy mignonette of shallots, red wine vinegar and cracked black peppercorns. Our only complaint was that careless opening of the shells left chips and slivers.
1994-12-11	Mastercard's Move to County Affirmed	"THE multimillion-dollar deal that will bring more than 600 Mastercard workers from Manhattan to Westchester is to be completed this week. The complex agreement, which real estate sources indicate could exceed $40 million, will conclude several years of on-again-off-again negotiations.

Mastercard International officials confirmed last Tuesday that conclusion was imminent of the deal involving the acquisition of the former International Business Machines building at 2000 Purchase Street here. Officials said the company will embark on a multimillion dollar renovation and move its corporate headquarters from Manhattan to Purchase by next November. The company employs more than 570 workers in Manhattan. It expects to have a payroll of 650 employees at the new headquarters."

While the food is quite good, the kitchen's occasional tendency to oversauce is something to watch out for. Current starters include fried calamari with a roasted tomato and basil dipping sauce; fried cornmeal-coated oysters with corn salsa and smoked chile sauce, and grilled shrimp and andouille sausage with a creole honey-mustard sauce. Among main courses are grilled chicken with chipotle mayonnaise and roasted peppers; fettucine combined with shrimp and crawfish, tomatoes and roasted garlic; blackened catfish with a bourbon pecan butter sauce, and grilled sirloin with a wild mushroom and red wine sauce.

""And then the next thing we knew we had Bob Row."" Bob Row, for the uninitiated, is what locals call the block anchored by TriBeCa Grill on Greenwich Street and Nobu on Hudson; both restaurants are owned by Robert De Niro. And both, according to my friend, are too expensive for most of the artists who live in the area. ""But then they all are,"" she says, pointing to the nearby Chanterelle. She worries that her neighborhood is being taken over by restaurants for rich people, and she considers the new Spartina the sole ray of hope. ""At last,"" she says, ""a real neighborhood restaurant. The food is affordable and they always have something I want to eat."""
1994-12-04	Want to Know Why Pizza Beats Steak?	THE Red Lion Ristorante on Route 7 in Ridgefield, reopened after a kitchen fire and seven-year hiatus, now has an open, airy and light interior. Roomy booths have old-fashioned fringed lampshades and green marble-top tables. A central dining gazebo, outlined in lights and hung with plants, is reminiscent of a Mississippi riverboat lounge. The menu has also changed from one that was mostly steaks, chops and seafood of lesser interest than the entertainment to Italian with an emphasis on pizzas and pastas, with a few meat and chicken dishes and seafood specials.

Kevin McClintock, manager of fixed-income portfolios for Aeltus Investment Management Inc. in Hartford, cited reports of October home sales growth and strong Christmas sales as a troublesome twosome for bonds yesterday.
1994-11-28	Retailers Cautiously Optimistic	Heavy advertising and promotional campaigns helped draw shoppers into stores during the weekend, and several retailers reported that their sales in the first two days of the holiday shopping season were slightly better than expected. But most executives were circumspect about business, and one survey of foot traffic in 33 malls around the country found fewer shoppers this year than last year for the first weekend of holiday shopping.

Not far from the George Washington Bridge, the modern, casually stylish eating place is in the strip mall where Look See used to be. And as with the former resident restaurant's food, some of the dishes at Sally Ling's can be called hybrid Chinese.

There really is a Sally Ling, and she can usually be found greeting regulars by name and keeping an unobtrusive eye on the dining room. She says she used to operate six restaurants with the same name in Boston before coming to Bergen County last year."

"IT has been decades since the enthusiastic uniformed Men from Texaco sang their way through hard-charging sales pitches and Esso insistently promised it would ""put a tiger in your tank."" Today's gasoline advertising tries selling in a far softer, more low-key manner, as demonstrated by a humorous, at times even winsome, campaign for the Sun Company. Broadcast commercials and print advertisements by Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York focus on products like Sunoco gasoline and a new ""co-branded"" credit card linking Sunoco and Mastercard. The campaign for Sun, which spends $13 million to $14 million annually on promoting its Sunoco brand and service stations in the East and Midwest, is intended to put gasoline in its proper place, so to speak."

This small, very personally styled restaurant in Maplewood has been owned by Holly Guber for eight and a half years. At that time the mismatched tables, chairs and cutlery were unified by a warm terra-cotta and dark green paisley fabric on the walls and windows that gave a certain intimacy. Now the walls have been sponge painted a cross between yellow ocher and burnt sienna, and the draperies are dark green. The look is more spacious yet less welcoming."
1994-11-20	Viewpoints; The Credit Card: We Love It, We Hate It	WHAT is the defining act of the American consumer? Easy. It is handing a salesperson that slim piece of encoded plastic -- the credit card. What is harder to answer is why so common an act is such a mystery. On the one hand, we love the Card. There are 1.15 billion credit cards in circulation, amounting to nearly 10 for every American cardholder. This year, collectively, we will charge about $700 billion of goods and $325 billion of debt on them.

The study will be conducted through a direct-mail campaign.

Interesting Combinations in Thai Cuisine"	"NOW and then, a particular dish is so intriguing that it lingers in the memory long after the meal is past. At the Thai Chef, a simple and bright new eating place in Montclair, the crispy duck salad is one such dish. Arranged in a stylish tower of duck morsels and cracklings with matchsticks of carrots, red bell pepper and Granny Smith apple, the salad comes scattered with peanuts and dressed with a sauce of roasted curry paste sharpened with lime juice and a top knot of cilantro.

Such contrasts of sweet and sour, soft and crunchy, spicy and cool are what makes Thai food so compelling. Veera Premon, the chef at the four-month-old Essex County storefront, adds a refined and cosmopolitan accent to many of his dishes, reflecting his youthful training in Bangkok hotels and as chef at the Bistro Montmartre in New York. He and his wife also operate the Thai Chef on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. Mr. Premon says his duck salad was well liked by Queen Sirikit of Thailand on a New York visit."

A Nod to California in Croton-on-Hudson"	"NOT long after its opening three years ago, Sonoma became a popular meeting and eating spot. As its name suggests, California inspires the theme, the West Coast represented nowhere better than in the wine list. Recent visits, however, indicate that much of the culinary potential that Sonoma exhibited in its early days seems to be lost. 

But folks come here for reasons other than the food. On weekends, when there is live music, diners might have to push their way through the crowded, commodious cafe and bar area at the entrance to the serene, airier dining room. On a weeknight the scene is considerably less hectic and the back dining room almost empty."

A New Face Along the Beaten Path"	"LA LANTERNA, open only seven weeks, has already swung into action, not missing a beat since its move from Eastchester's Chester Heights and its reopening along the Saw Mill River Parkway in Yonkers. Reservations on weekends are a must. In its new location -- last occupied by Peppercorns -- the restaurant has kept much of its old clientele while adding new fans who find the place an ideal stopping point either home from or home to the city. But proximity alone doesn't draw the crowds. Not least are the big welcome, the generous portions, the ""anything you want"" attitude, the moderate prices and the quality of the food.

A wonderful opener, a special Portobello mushroom, as meaty as they come, went perfectly with a cake of polenta; and had it not been beaten to mush, carpaccio would have been as winning, certainly as fine as the arugula and shavings of Parmesan sharing the plate. Served in a bowl with spicy cherry pepper and black olive sauce, fried calamari quickly became soggy. Best to have that excellent sauce served separately."
1994-10-23	How a Chef Makes All the Difference	STEVEN WILKINSON is something of a legend among Connecticut River area chefs for his pioneer work in nouvelle cuisine but his celebrated French restaurant, Fine Bouche, is no more. Weep not though, for Chef Wilkinson has regrouped on the same premises in Centerbrook with a new name, Steve's Centerbrook Cafe, and a French-Mediterranean menu with Asian accents that reflects changing food habits and a more natural, casual style of eating. At first glance, the sedately pretty dining rooms, in off white and pale peach with lace curtains, white-painted rattan chairs and Impressionist-style paintings, look much as before, though not quite as casual as the new restaurant name suggests. The short menu quickly tells the new story though: less ambitious, featuring pastas and many grilled entrees, with threads of Asian, especially Thai, ingredients woven into the Mediterranean tapestry.

That ushered in an age of discounts for cash at the pump. But now the pendulum is swinging the other way. Oil companies have not only eliminated their discounts for cash, they have also begun to offer a new type of credit card that offers rebates on future gasoline purchases. It's a kind of frequent-flier program for people whose ""flying"" is limited to brief jolts on bumpy roads."

Classic Italian Cuisine in Eastchester"	"IF a midweek night at Pinocchio's is a reliable economic indicator, the recession may well be over. The unwavering standards of this restaurant continue to draw a full house of patrons who want neither the extravagant preciosity of 80's haute cuisine nor the down-home folksiness of its 90's backlash: meat and potatoes. Here, for a price, one dines on food tied to the centuries rather than decades -- classic Italian cuisine.

In the last several years, the menus have been pared down to the popular items the kitchen does best, and many more specials have been added. These additions guarantee variety for the frequent patron, but all diners would prefer to pore over them on a printed insert rather than remember snatches of a waiter's detailed recital.

And the man just behind me is shouting, ""You've really never tried Prozac?"" Hollywood has invaded Manhattan disguised as a Japanese restaurant. But as any of the Japanese travelers who flock to the restaurant will tell you, Nobu, despite its sushi bar and elegantly arranged plates of tempura, is not a Japanese restaurant. It isn't really an American restaurant, either, but something that seems as if it were invented on an airplane 5 miles up and 1,500 miles inland from either coast. The decor, a cross between an enchanted forest and a set for the movie ""Mishima,"" places Nobu firmly in that fantasy restaurantland that recognizes no geographic boundaries. When you walk through the door of this former bank, you must be prepared for a grand entertainment."
1994-10-05	Major American Express Layoffs Expected Soon	American Express will announce details of long-planned cost-cutting moves in the next few days, according to a letter that Harvey Golub, the company's chairman, sent to employees on Monday night. The company will probably close two of its seven large operating centers in the United States and several smaller centers, as well, a person close to the company said. It is not likely to announce a specific target for the number of jobs to be cut, but internal estimates range from 3,000 to 5,000. The big operating centers each have 1,000 to 1,500 employees.

Contemporary Dishes, Victorian Decor"	"PLEIADES, a casually stylish storefront restaurant in Englewood, hit the ground running when it opened three months ago. It already has a clublike buzz with table-hopping Bergen County regulars, who come, no doubt, for the eclectic, contemporary food and the reasonable entree prices. 

The owners are the Weitzman family, first-time restaurateurs who converted a former dress shop on the town's main street into a convivial space with an updated Victorian decor. Named after the mythical seven daughters of Atlas and their namesake cluster of stars, the restaurant has an exposed brick wall, William Morris-style wallpaper and closely spaced green faux-malachite tables."

Where the Specialty Is Northern Italian"	"REVIEWERS try to be as anonymous as possible when they go to a restaurant. But never have I felt more successful at this often difficult task than one evening at an Italian restaurant in Princeton called Casabona. Everyone at the table was served his entree but me. Not only had the waiter forgotten to order my liver with balsamic vinegar, but when he went to the kitchen to do so, there was none left.

That particular evening there were quite a few items at this Mercer County restaurant that were either not available or where substitutions were made, frequently to the detriment of the dish. Salmon with mustard sauce sounded delicious, but baby bass was substituted and the mustard overpowered this more delicate fish. More unusual was to find a restaurant all out of buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes at 8 P.M."
1994-09-25	Compelling Simplicity at the Right Price	THE Ridgefield Coffee Company, on Ridgefield's main thoroughfare, is a good deal more than its matter-of-fact name suggests. Unlike most coffeehouses or bars, it avoids the plastic-wrapped sandwiches and sweets trundled in from an outside vendor. Achef, formerly at Hay Day, and staff dish up freshly made omelets, salads, pasta dishes and sandwiches. The space itself is handsome, with high ceilings, white walls, huge framed French posters, floor-to-ceiling cherrywood cabinets and a counter display case full of luscious looking desserts. Along the counter is an assortment of newspapers for perusing over breakfast, lunch, or a soupbowl-size cup of coffee.
1994-09-25	Dining Downtown: Tastes of TriBeCa	ARQUA ** (212) 334-1888; 281 Church Street, at White Street; $$$; American Express, Mastercard, Visa An industrial space softened by ocher walls, with reasonably priced rustic Italian fare. Pastas are excellent, like the potato and nut ravioli with basil sauce. Among entrees are sauteed tuna steak with a thyme-infused wine sauce; braised rabbit and spring lamb with a balsamic reduction.

1994-09-24	Visa Wins a Key Round in Antitrust Suit by Dean Witter	Visa U.S.A. won a key round in court yesterday in its effort to fend off an antitrust suit brought by Dean Witter, Discover & Company. The suit had been widely watched even beyond the banking industry because of the high damages at stake and the significant legal issues it raised. A Federal appeals court in Denver yesterday reversed a jury verdict that Visa had violated antitrust laws by prohibiting Dean Witter from issuing Visa cards. Dean Witter said yesterday that it would appeal.

Sophisticated Rendition of Bistro Fare"	"WHEN a very personal restaurant like Catherine Alexandrou's Chez Catherine, in Westfield, changes hands and yet sticks to the same formula, there's always the risk that the replacement will suffer by comparison. Happily, that is not the case with Chez Memere, which is now the name of the cozy little bistro in the Westfield Motor Inn. 

The new owners, Therese and Francis Drillien, who are originally from the south of France, took over the Union County place at the end of May."

Chinese Cover New Ground in Hartsdale"	"ALTHOUGH many of the dishes on the menu at K. Fung's will come as no surprise to most diners, the kitchen of this Chinese restaurant explores new ground in its aim to produce fare that is healthful as well as tempting. Almost all orders are freshly prepared, and oil and salt are used with restraint. Diners have a choice of brown or white rice.

The kitchen will also customize dishes to meet dietary needs. And, as a matter of course, whole or finely shredded vegetables are employed generously, and a number of salads are offered. Although not every dish won unqualified applause, the cooking can be quite good, and when it is, diners can look forward to a first-rate meal."
1994-09-18	Formal Decor, Italian Fare, Fairway Views	WHAT a surprise to find a formal dining room overlooking a municipal golf course! But that's what greeted us at Cafe on the Green Ristorante in Danbury, complete with a stern-faced maitre d'hotel in tuxedo who stiffly led us to a table commanding views of the fairway in two directions. His demeanor and that of the formal staff contrasted sharply with the casual attire of many guests as well as the golf course backdrop. The spacious dining room is a beauty, with large picture windows lining two entire walls. Polished brass railings separate the serving area, and the white-napped tables are set with fresh flowers and burgundy cloths, a color picked up around the room.
1994-09-17	Secured Credit Cards Are Attracting Savers	LOOKING for a high rate of return on their savings, some people with stellar credit histories are using what has been known as the credit card of last resort. The cards, called secured credit cards, were designed for people with a bad credit record (or none at all) who failed to qualify for a conventional card. For a minimum deposit, generally $300 to $500, a Visa or Mastercard is issued with a matching line of credit.
1994-09-11	"DINING OUT;
Fare With Latin Beat in Yorktown Heights"	"CARVED into a corner of the international Miracle Mile Food Market, this jolly newcomer brings to the northern reaches of the county food with the Latin beat that has, in recent years, echoed through lower and mid-Westchester, capturing a growing, appreciative audience. More mellow than salsa, the dominant tone at the Pepper Grill is Portuguese, but other notes sound as well from Spain, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador and Brazil.

With its open kitchen, displays of ingredients and picnic tables, this eating spot is considerably less formal than its southern competitors, and open only since July, the place is still feeling its way. While the grilling -- top-of-the-stove, short-order style -- of the kitchen assures freshly made results, it also creates quite a bit of smoke and steam, which drift into the dining area. Best to wear washable clothing. Some items on the menu were not available. And while adding to the informality of the place, picnic tables occupy a great deal of space; conventional round tables could accommodate those diners who now must wait for a table during peak hours."
1994-09-07	BUSINESS DIGEST	Companies Sales of cars and light trucks surged 10.3 percent in August, suggesting that American auto makers were correct in attributing a July slowdown to production shortfalls, rather than to a drop in demand. Stocks of the Big Three auto makers rose. [ Page D1. ]
1994-09-07	American Express Offers New Card	The American Express Company, making a long-awaited drive for a market far larger than globe-trotters and executives on the town, introduced a new credit card yesterday, its first with no annual fee. The new mass-market challenge to banks that issue Visa and Mastercard reflects a change of strategy at American Express. Under Harvey Golub, its chairman for the last year and a half, the company has chosen to play down the trademark green and gold charge cards, which require payment in full and carry a high annual fee.
1994-09-06	An End to the 'Nightmare' of Cash?	"The relentless march of technology into the smallest details of everyday life may be reaching the final frontier: the advent of the electronic penny. Banks, credit card companies and even the governments of some countries are racing to introduce ""electronic purses,"" wallet-size cards embedded with rechargeable microchips that store sums of money for people to use instead of cash for everything from buying fast food to paying highway tolls."

It is a good and friendly spot for a casual meal. Recommended dishes include the charcoal-grilled hamburger dressed with a caper-mustard sauce and accompanied by french fries; rotisserie-broiled chicken; roasted salmon salad with avocado-basil mayonnaise and buttered carrots, zucchini and tomatoes, and the grilled marinated loin of pork sandwich, which is served on country bread with a mustard dressing, garlic, roasted peppers and arugula. To begin, try the pizzette with zucchini, roasted red peppers, prosciutto, mozzarella and tomato, or the fried calamari with a tomato and red pepper sauce. (Review: 11/1/85; revisited: 8/94)

Contemporary American, With a View"	"THE sweeping views from Ironwood, the public restaurant at the Basking Ridge Country Club, have always been serenely beautiful. The bilevel dining room overlooks the rolling, tree-lined fairways of the golf course and the Somerset hills in the distance. It is even nicer to dine outdoors on the terrace with its umbrella tables and fringe of flowers. 

But until recently, the standard-issue club fare and the amateurish service had not been on a par with the setting. An experienced executive chef, Victor Bruno, who formerly cooked at the Rainbow Room in Manhattan among other places, was brought in, along with professional managers, to upgrade the Somerset County restaurant."
1994-08-21	Hats, Horns and Hopalong, With Chili	A RESTAURANT as redolent of an old-time Texas tavern as Ash Creek Saloon in Fairfield tends to bring out the drawl in most of us. Consider: you enter the restaurant through a noisy, old-time bar, complete with a brightly colored nickelodeon (crowned by a saddle) that is going full blast. The somewhat quieter dining room, a long, narrow storefront, has a pressed-tin ceiling, Tiffany-style hanging lamps, dark wood paneling, one brick wall and accouterments like cowboy hats, horns, almost-lifesize cut-outs of Roy Rogers and a picture of Hopalong Cassidy.
1994-08-20	For People With Citidollars, It's Use Them or Lose Them	Bonuses sometimes lure consumers into choosing a particular credit card or other product. Just look at the popularity of frequent-flier programs and the airline-linked credit cards, which accumulate free miles. But, all too often, there is a catch: the programs can change at any time or be discontinued.

Charming New Location Beside a Canal"	"WITH restaurants and real estate, location is supposed to be everything. That is perhaps the reason for the lines of people on weekends waiting to get into La Dolce Vita in New Hope, Pa. The Bucks County establishment used to be in Lambertville, but about 10 months ago it moved across the river to a charming location beside the Delaware Canal.

When La Dolce Vita moved, the menu was taken along intact. But it seems that there have been several changes of chef since the Lambertville days, and it shows. In fact, the dishes that appeared in New Hope bore little resemblance either to those served in the former location or to the menu description. Food was inelegantly served, often piled high on the plates, and the servers hardly seemed to know what's what."
1994-08-14	"DINING OUT;
A Tidy 'Family' Spot in New Rochelle"	"A GLEAMING cappuccino machine takes center stage at a small bar with a graceful marble-topped bar separated somewhat from the dining area with glass-brick partitions. Pleasant paintings, fresh flowers and green and white linens brighten this tidy little neighborhood Italian restaurant that serves food a cut above what one expects at a ""family"" spot. The tiny space at Il Brunello, though reflected in a wall of mirrors, can be cramped and smoky when full, as it was even on a weekday night. But no wonder, a special complete dinner is $14, a four-course bargain hard to pass up. More sophisticated fare can be found, for a price, among the specials, like grilled portobello mushrooms and fresh fish. 

In general, dishes here were extremely light and tasted freshly prepared. They also had a subtle flavor of olives from the olive oil the kitchen uses, a taste much to our liking."
1994-08-14	A Welcome, Timely Touch of Tuscany	TIMING has much to do with a restaurant's success. The new Tuscan Oven on Route 7 in Norwalk is a case in point. This part of Route 7 has recently sprouted a series of office buildings, and Tuscan Oven, with an airy, inviting trattoria-style decor, offers an alternative to the fast-food spots that line the highway. Of the restaurant's two nonsmoking dining rooms, the front room, with pastel sponged walls, decorative posts and wood floor, is larger and faces the open kitchen and brick oven. The rear room, with tiled floor, faux grotto details and exposed beams, is cooler and quieter. In all three rooms, tables are well spaced for comfortable, uncrowded dining.
1994-08-07	"DINING OUT;
Haute Cuisine in Hushed Atmosphere"	"THE beckoning flowers and greenery leading to L'Europe's door have a long-established look; the building itself seems to have settled a few more inches into its roadside lot over the years. 

Inside, little has changed since the place opened.  Sparkling appointments grace tables; the place still has that dignified hush. But because the kitchen these days is in such excellent form -- the food equaling that at some of the charming inns in the area -- we became more aware, and critical, of our somewhat spartan surroundings."
1994-08-07	"DINING OUT;
Earthy Southern Italian Dishes Served"	"EARTHY southern Italian dishes are the fare of choice at Capo Vaticano, an unpretentious and likable little eating place in Florham Park. Tucked in a strip mall not far from Loehmann's, this is the kind of neighborhood storefront where diners are greeted with a reassuring whiff of garlic when they enter and served by bantering, diner-style waitresses who call them ""hon."" 

That the generous plates of food can be hit or miss doesn't seem to bother this Morris County restaurant's many regulars. Those who didn't reserve a table are willing to wait outside until one is available, clutching their brown-bagged bottles of wine since there's no liquor license."

The Inn at Quogue is a lovely backdrop for Mr. Tesar's creations.

Next to it on the corner is the open-air, seasonal Cafe Bravo, which shares the same ownership but has a different menu, kitchen and more casual mien. Restaurant Bravo Bravo is minuscule (seating only 50). With oak floors and tabletops, white walls alternating with dark green ones, a window wall on the street and ornately framed mirrors, it exudes simple stylishness.
1994-07-31	Signs Of Life In County's Economy	NEWS this month that I.B.M. profits jumped during the second quarter of the year appeared to signal more than just a fresh start for the once-beleaguered Armonk-based computer giant. Analysts said the announcement from the county's largest private employer ended weeks of speculation that the economy in general in Westchester was finally pulling out of a slump. There continued to be a growing list of indicators this summer that the recession -- which hit hard and lasted so long in Westchester -- was finally loosening its grip here, as it had much earlier in other parts of America.
1994-07-29	25 and Under	Although it opened just a few weeks ago, First, an East Village storefront with an eclectic mix of foods, is already a happy place to eat. The owners, Stephen Billings, Joanne Coraci and Samuel DeMarco, seeing how Blue Ribbon has built a thriving late-night crowd in SoHo, hope to do the same thing on First Avenue, serving food until 2 or 3 A.M. nightly. But the food, with nods to Mexico, Thailand, Japan, France and Italy, is delicious at any hour. Mr. DeMarco, the chef, last cooked at Luxe, a luxury Manhattan restaurant that closed this year. Now he has taken a less-expensive turn that does not sacrifice creativity. Crisp squid rings ($6.50), for example, are far superior to ordinary fried calamari. This dish is an artful composition of squid perfectly fried in a salt-tinged batter and arranged around slices of sweet-and-spicy pickled ginger and slivers of marinated seaweed, with a small bowl of wasabi-flavored mayonnaise.

Mr. Wan, 33 years old, is part of what must surely be China's oddest culinary trend. He has joined the ranks of Beijing restaurateurs who are offering diners the chance to relive the deprivations of Cultural Revolution, the 10 years in which Mao Zedong solidified his cult of personality with waves of political terror and forced migration.

These days, however, the kitchen is less consistent. We suspect that David Fehr, the owner and chef, has left the cooking chores to other, less competent hands, at least part of the time. One evening's dinner can be superb, a lucky thing for weekend clientele when, we suspect, Mr. Fehr is on."

Among starters are a good cold seafood salad, with shrimp, lobster, scallops and squid bathed in olive oil dressing; grilled portobello mushrooms with garlic, fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil, and broiled stuffed zucchini with a ground meat and cheese filling. Pastas, served in full or half portions, include capellini con aragosta (chunks of lobster and fresh clams in tomato sauce) and rigatoni with white wine, tomatoes, onions and zucchini.
1994-07-24	Italian Style With Asian Accents	THE influx of weekending New Yorkers has already altered the once sleepy culinary landscape of northwestern Connecticut. This is evident in the new Bee Brook in Washington Depot, which overlooks the surging Shepaug and Bee Brook rivers and maximizes its site with two dining decks shaded by giant oaks and maples. Indoors the atmosphere is more sophisticated: a small, high-ceiling room with a handsome wooden floor, large Colonial-style wrought-iron chandeliers, a dramatic fieldstone fireplace, well-spaced tables and subdued lighting.

It sounds like a David Letterman routine: New York, New York, the city that was tottering on the brink of bankruptcy 20 years ago, is considering creating its own credit card. But Mayor Rudolph W.

1994-07-20	MASTERCARD STARTS A SMART-CARD PROGRAM	Mastercard International Inc. said yesterday that it had begun a previously planned program to develop microchip-based payment cards, known as smart cards. The cards depend on the establishment of global payment standards, a task being undertaken by Mastercard and its Belgium-based European partner, Europay International, along with Visa International Inc. The standards are to be completed by the end of this year. By the end of 1995, Mastercard plans to have rules for its customers on how to accept and issue smart cards. By 1996, the company plans to have terminals available to merchants. Smart cards would replace the magnetic strip now on the back of most credit cards with a chip that could hold the equivalent of about two pages of text.

The food centers on rice or vegetables. Although the food is traditionally eaten with the fingers, table settings at Akwaaba offer the full range of silverware. Rich soups, rice balls and various mashed tubers, roots and grains are served with towels and silver bowls for washing hands. African specialties include omo tuo, a salami-size cylinder of moist compressed rice that is torn and dipped into a fragrant peanut soup or stew, slightly peppery and rich with palm oil. The soup comes with beef, chicken or fish (salt cod or fried mackerel). Egushie is a pungent mix of ground sunflower seeds and spinach that also goes well with fish. Another winner is watche, a peppery combination of rice and black-eyed peas served with a lightly fried whole porgy. ($25 and Under: 4/16/93)
1994-07-10	The Decor's Colorful, the Menu's Eclectic	IT is hard to imagine a more complete change in decor than that transforming the old Manero's into the new Restaurant 540 (the name and the restaurant's address on Riverside Avenue in Westport). The building is caramel-corn-color stucco with dark red trim on the outside; inside, Restaurant 540 offers avocado green, salmon and vibrant blue walls that tilt inward like a cross between a ship and a funhouse at an amusement park. But one soon realizes the artistry (the work of the fashion designer Alexander Julian) required to deal with such a high-ceiling cavernous space, which has now been broken artfully into more intimate sections, with banquettes along one wall and a separate dining space on one side. Slightly separated from the main dining area is an equally colorful bar area with tables where a jazz trio plays every Sunday evening.
1994-07-04	In World Cup, Business Just Sees Net	More than halfway through the World Cup, here is the inescapable fact: you can't escape the World Cup.

1994-07-03	Summery Evening at a Country Inn	SOME restaurants, like wine, really do improve with age, and it warmed the cockles of this professional diner's heart to reaffirm this on a recent return trip to the Boulders in New Preston. The Boulders is an inn as well as a restaurant, and its glassed-in dining room and open, three-level dining terraces, beneath huge, sheltering maple trees, have the same hillside view of mirror-smooth Lake Waramaug as do many of its guest rooms. Boulders is an apt name, for the 1895 shingle-sided house is buttressed by support columns of huge field stones.
1994-07-02	Guarding Credit Cards From the Latest Scams	FOR the companies that issue credit cards and the people who use them, fraud is an ever-changing concern. In one of the newest scams, a criminal steals a legitimate card holder's account, persuades the issuing bank to send another card to a new mailing address and quickly runs up large bills. The card holder may not be liable for the bills, but there is the aggravation of canceling the card and getting a new one, and the anxiety of knowing that your card is in others' hands.
1994-06-29	ACCORD IS REACHED IN ALBANY TO CURB PAY-PHONE RATES	New York State legislative leaders announced agreement today on a bill that for the first time would limit certain rates on pay telephones owned by small private companies, which often charge high prices and surcharges to unsuspecting customers. The privately owned pay phones, commonly found in bars, airports and neighborhood grocery stores, have sprouted up during the decade since the phone industry was deregulated, now accounting for about a quarter of the 166,000 pay phones in the state. In many low-income areas, residents who cannot afford their own phones have no choice but to pay whatever rates the companies charge at the pay phones.

Country Charm and Wines in Amenia"	"OF the several approaches to this woodsy restaurant, we like the views from Webutuck School Road (off Route 22 at the Webutuck School and three miles north of the traffic light in Amenia), which rises over a patchwork quilt of Dutchess County farms, ponds and woodland, the genius of rural America. The pleasant dining deck of the restaurant overlooks the grassy vestige of an orchard now sparse with only a couple of gnarled trunks, a barbecue and shrubs against a wooded backdrop. The interior is as unaffectedly country as the outdoors, a Franklin stove assuring coziness on cooler days. 

The kitchen's style follows the natural theme that seems to mark this place. Hudson Valley ingredients -- Coach Farms and Hollow Road cheeses, superb local produce and, of course, their own Cascade Mountain Vineyards wine -- are used whenever possible. In a culinary world where most kitchens get it wrong much of the time, this kitchen gets it right almost every time."
1994-06-26	"DINING OUT;
Trying Unfamiliar Cantonese Dishes"	"DINING at better Cantonese restaurants, whether in northern New Jersey or in Chinatown, can be two different experiences. Chinese-Americans are usually given a separate menu offering a number of dishes that are not included in the one that is handed to everyone else. There's not a pu pu platter or ""sizzling lover's delight"" to be found on the one written in Chinese characters. 

Anyone who has glanced at the Chinese-American family at the next table and asked the waiter about the dishes and platters of food they are being showered with, only to be told, ""You won't like it,"" knows the frustration."
1994-06-26	Traveler's Checks	To the Editor: The letter on two-signature traveler's checks reminded my of our experience in Bologna in April. I presented one of these checks to the foreign exchange bureau at the main railroad station. The rate was very fair, but they demanded two counter-signatures, because it had two original signatures. Luckily, my wife was nearby, but this is not the way checks-for-two is supposed to work.
1994-06-26	Bites on Broadway: Food as Theater	"CAFE UN DEUX TROIS * (212) 354-4148; 123 West 44th Street; $$; all major credit cards For its reliably animated atmosphere and straightforward bistro fare, this cavernous spot continues to be one of the better bets for theater-district dining. The short regular menu is supplemented by many daily specials. Among current appetizers are baked snails in garlic and butter, pate de campagne and mixed greens tossed in a good vinaigrette. For main courses, steak au poivre is always pleasing. Other dishes include roast chicken with french fries, a notable, slightly spicy steak tartare and calves liver with grilled onions. On the lighter side, try the Nicoise salad, with tuna, green beans, potatoes and more, or the assembly of greens, apples, walnuts and Roquefort. (Review: 4/5/91) CARMINE'S * (212) 221-3800; 200 West 44th Street; $; American Express This family-style Italian restaurant is the sister establishment of the original Carmine's on the Upper West Side. The room is done in sandy tones and dark wood trim with stock publicity photos adorning the walls, overhead fans and neighborly tables. Portions are so stupendous that most patrons share, resulting in an average check of about $20 a person. Among popular starters are tasty baked clams and crunchy calamari deep-fried in a peppery batter and served with tomato sauce on the side. Colossal entrees include rigatoni with fennel sausage and broccoli in a sweet tomato sauce; a 36-ounce porterhouse steak under a sauce of tomatoes, onions and sweet peppers; a 20-ounce swordfish steak with tomato, basil, capers and black olives, and chicken scarpariello with onions and fennel sausage. (Review: 9/25/92) CENTURY CAFE ** (212) 398-1988; 132 West 43d Street; $$; all major credit cards This friendly cafe has an airy, casual feel with its sky-blue ceiling, hardwood floor, theatrical track lighting, long green banquettes and paper-draped tables. The menu, an engaging mix of contemporary American fare, features appetizers like grilled Louisiana prawns with a toasted sesame dressing; a fish and crabmeat soup with chives; asparagus risotto, and losbter salad with braised artichokes tossed in a mango and sweet pepper dressing. For main courses, grilled marinated salmon in Moroccan spices is served with saffron couscous and grilled asparagus flavored with a shellfish vinaigrette; pan-seared tuna is topped with a mixture of crushed coriander, roasted pine nuts and sun-dried tomatoes. Starting at 8 o'clock nightly, the restaurant promotes some 80 wines from all over the world by selling them at a dollar over cost. (Review: 9/11/92) CHEZ JOSEPHINE ** (212) 594-1925; 414 West 42d Street; $$; all major credit cards At any hour on any night, this bistro dedicated to Josephine Baker is a kinetic party overseen by Jean-Claude Baker, an incessant storyteller and one of the unofficially adopted sons of the 30's chanteuse. Musicians of all types, some from Broadway and Off Broadway shows, drop in nightly and often find themselves behind Mr. Baker's grand piano. The French-American menu offers a beguiling selection. Current appetizers include endive salad with Roquefort and walnuts, and Chinese-style ravioli with goat cheese, fresh herbs and roasted pignoli nuts. Among main courses are a first-rate boudin noir (blood sausage) with red cabbage, onions and sauteed apples; cassoulet of lobster, shrimp, scallops and seafood sausage with black beans in a shellfish broth, and ""Elvira's down-home fried chicken,"" with sweet potato fries and cornbread.

The main dining room is cozily upholstered, spacious and softly lighted. The cooking of Dominique Peyraudeau, the chef, is classically rooted, but with a light touch. On the current list of appetizers are a terrine of game studded with pistachios and hazelnuts; lobster and sweetbreads in a white port aspic; dill-marinated salmon and scallops with a drizzle of olive oil, and chicken consomme with wild mushrooms. Entrees include grilled snapper with tomatoes, olives and capers; salmon paillard with sorrel sauce; rack of lamb in a mustard crust; roast duck served with a chocolate and kumquat sauce, and veal medallions with rosemary and a ragout of morel mushrooms. (Review: 5/1/92) LATTANZI * (212) 315-0980; 361 West 46th Street; $$; American Express This simply decorated spot with exposed brick walls and small hanging lights turns out an array of zestily seasoned pastas and grilled entrees. For starters, baby artichokes prepared in the style of the Jewish quarter in Rome are delicious in golden-green olive oil pungent with garlic. There is also a salmon carpaccio with lemon and olive oil, and slices of fresh mozzarella with tomatoes and basil. Tomato sauce, in various guises, is common to many of the dishes; a notable rendition is the lightly spiced sauce with capers and browned nuggets of chicken in the pollo capriccioso. Other choices include stuffed tortelloni with veal and chicken in marinara sauce; cappellini primavera, with its well-cooked vegetables; veal scallopine topped with mushrooms and marsala wine sauce, and grilled lamb chops. (Review: 6/23/89; revisited: 5/93) ORSO ** (212) 489-7212; 322 West 46th Street; $$; Mastercard, Visa This spiffy, upbeat trattoria with a large skylight in the rear dining room knows how to cater to the theater crowd. The engaging menu changes daily, ranging from such light selections as salads, zesty thin-crusted pizzas and grilled seafoods to more substantial fare. Typical appetizers are bruschetta; carpaccio of marinated salmon; dandelion and white anchovy salad; warm porcini and white bean salad with tomatoes, and a half dozen varieties of individual pizza. On the main-course list are a risotto of green peas, taleggio and mascarpone cheeses; rigatoni with eggplant, zucchini and tomato; sauteed calves liver with onions and bacon; grilled soft shell crabs with a salad of orange, radicchioand red onion, and rosemary-roasted chicken with lemon. (Review: 6/4/93) Bistro Classic PIERRE AU TUNNEL * (212) 575-1220; 250 West 47th Street; $$; all major cards This bistro serves dependable peasant-style dishes and Gallic classics in a warm and homey setting. Among starters are a light and vivid scallop mousse glossed with chive butter; salmon and sole terrine with a tomato-basil coulis, and a goat cheese, arugula and endive salad. Main-course options on the current menu include grilled tuna with a reduction of Xeres wine vinegar and a saute of zucchini, tomato and onions; roast duck with an apple-orange sauce, roasted cabbage and baked apple, and lamb chop with a potato gratin.

1994-06-12	"DINING OUT;
A New Place With Tuscan Specialties"	"WITH the recent opening of three Italian restaurants, and with at least one more in the works, Summit is risking tiramisu and focaccia overload. In fact, that Italian bread made from pizza dough lends its name to La Focaccia, the pick of this new crop of eating places in the Union County city.

The brightly casual storefront, which opened three months ago in the former Nicky B's location, is already popular with local diners, whose table-hopping gives the open 75-seat room a clubby tone. There's often a line at the door since reservations are not accepted for small groups."
1994-06-12	Teller Machines Open At 3 Moscow Locations	Visitors to Moscow are now able to use automated teller machines connected to the MasterCard/Cirrus A.T.M. system at three spots: Sheremetyevo International Airport, the Novoarbatsky department store and the Central Telephone and Telegraph office. By the end of the year, an additional six machines in Moscow and two locations in St. Petersburg are expected to be added. For the time being the machines dispense only United States dollars, but eventually users will be able to obtain rubles.
1994-06-12	American Fare and a Gospel Brunch	MICHE MACHE, which enjoyed considerable success in South Norwalk, has recently relocated in the former Country Tavern in North Stamford. The new place has a much larger dining room and smaller, informal Tack Room (in the bar area), each with a different menu (with some overlap). The old barn-red building resembles a rustic tavern, with an interior of buff-yellow stucco and barn siding walls, wood floors and old barn beams. A corner fireplace in the bar adds a cozy touch. New American cooking dominates the new menu (as it did the old), but this time around there seems a greater emphasis on dishes with a Southwest accent. This worked best in a starter of herb-fried calamari (a heaping portion chock-full of crispy legs) with a coriander-mayonnaise dip, and a sharply spiced jabanero relish. Texas wild boar chili had fire and heat, with the smoky tang of moist, shredded pork, but the huge bowl of meat, with infinitesimal bits of corn, tomato and carrots simmered with it, became monotonous midway through. Some contrasting texture -- or a smaller serving -- was sorely needed.
1994-06-05	"DINING OUT;
From Village Hall to River Rendezvous in Nyack"	"MUCH appeals about this restaurant, which seems to take its spirit from the community it inhabits. A lovely long mural of the Tappan Zee Bridge suggests the town's inexorable connection with the river. Creative renovation of this erstwhile village hall (its jail is now the wine cellar) pays heed to both history and esthetics. The venerable expanse -- brightened with light, color, fresh flowers and fresh faces of the staff -- provides an attractive environment for dining. Its location is convenient for those recovering from antiquing or a day's hard work, or from one of Nyack's popular street fairs or a drive in the country. 

Like a veteran ringmaster, Matthew Hudson, the owner, manages to orchestrate all proceedings from his place behind the bar. Other moments find him in the kitchen where he is the pastry chef concocting some notable desserts while Dan Coon, the chef, takes skillful charge of the other courses, not least among them the appetizers."
1994-06-05	Sleek Decor, French Style, Sound View	IF the Riviera Cafe near Long Island Sound in Branford were graded on decor alone, it would merit an easy A. The all-white setting of the small cafe evokes memories of the French Riviera: sleek white walls, rush-seated white chairs and tablecloths, sparkling glass and tableware and splashes of vibrant color in a few judiciously placed modern paintings. As along the Mediterranean coast, one looks forward to the happy prospect of dining. The menu is auspiciously small and eclectic, with an Italian accent, rather than pure French. A basket of bread (unfortunately nothing like a good, chewy baguette) was served with butter, but a small bottle of olive oil infused with garlic cloves on the table provided a more satisfactory option. It was followed, before the appetizers, by a crisp green salad of romaine leaves, radicchio, huge croutons and a peppery, creamy dressing.
1994-06-05	Despite Incentives to Stay, Mastercard Plans Move to Suburbs	Less than a year after Mastercard International said it would stay in Manhattan, it is considering moving most of its 450 New York employees to the suburbs. No announcement is to be made until the annual board meeting on July 15. But the huge credit-card association has looked at nine office buildings in White Plains, and in Stamford, Conn. It has also shown nearly a dozen potential sublet tenants, including two big financial-services concerns, through the nine floors it has leased at Burlington House, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, at 55th Street. Mastercard had planned to begin moving into Burlington House next May.
1994-05-29	"DINING OUT;
A Talented Chef's Sophisticated Fare"	"THE newly sophisticated, often exciting fare and the shaped-up service at Sam's Restaurant and Bar, in the Bergen County community of Cresskill, belie the restaurant's casual bistro setting and its earlier mixed reviews. That's because Steven Santoro, one of the state's most talented chefs, took over the range in January at this yearling, which is not far from the Palisades Parkway.

Food lovers who followed the young chef in the 1980's from Santoro's to Bronzini, both in Teaneck and now closed, may have lost the trail when he left for a four-year stint in Florida. But he returned to New Jersey to join his brother, Douglas Santoro, and the co-owner, John Gruen, at Sam's, bringing along his signature full-flavored yet light and contemporary fare."
1994-05-29	A Greenwich Cafe Comes Into Its Own	THE third incarnation of the cafe-restaurant-patisserie called Versailles in Greenwich has finally got it right. The improvements seem attributable to a new manager-sommelier, Paul Varni, from Lafayette and JoJo's in Manhattan, and a new chef, David Raymer, from Gotham Bar and Grill and Vince & Eddie's, also in Manhattan. The dinner menu has been given a welcome punch of modern French styling (the lunch menu has yet to be revised) while keeping the prices moderate. The wine list, too, has been thoughtfully revised, expanded, clarified and upgraded (while keeping prices affordable) with most wines from France and California priced between $22 and $30.
1994-05-22	"DINING OUT;
Century-Old Inn Takes On a New Name"	"AN interesting-sounding menu and a seeming lack of other restaurants nearby would normally make Geoffrey's a natural choice for anyone who happened to be in northwestern Bergen County. But the reality is less than meets the eye.

Geoffrey's, now owned by Geoffrey Smith and Bill Vezo, used to be called the Wyckoff Inn, and the 120-year-old building has one main dining room and four smaller ones. In fact, Geoffrey's has all the ingredients expected in an inn, including a fireplace, a bar and comfortable seating."
1994-05-22	"ABOUT MEN;
Card Sharks"	"If all my relatives suddenly died and all my friendships dried up and all of my subscriptions were canceled and all of my bills were paid, I would still be guaranteed mail -- two pieces a week, by my estimation -- for the credit card companies would still want me. They are the one constant in my ever-changing life. They are hot for what they think lies in my wallet. They are not just hot for me, either. I realize this. They want everyone, send mail to everyone. Everyone, that is, except those who need them most.

The absurdity in my case is the puny sum being sought. I work in a bookstore warehouse, lugging boxes and books around, at $8 per hour for 25 hours per week. That's roughly $10,000 per year. One would think that such a number could not possibly interest massive, internetted corporations and conglomerations. Yet they all vie for my attention. Visa, Mastercard, Discover Card -- it doesn't matter -- American Express, People's Bank, Citibank, Household Bank F.S.B., Choice, the GM Card, Norwest, Chevy Chase F.S.B. Not only am I preapproved, they tell me I'll have no annual fee. Their A.P.R. keeps dipping, like an auction in reverse, as each strives to undercut the other: from 14.98 to 9.98 to, now, 6.98 percent. I am titillated with each newer, lower number, as if it were an inverse indication of my self-worth. I have to remind myself that the promises of courtship rarely match the realities of marriage, and once we're signed, sealed and delivered to one another -- after a prerequisite honeymoon period -- the A.P.R. will bounce right back into double digits."
1994-05-22	Downtown Views, Italian Food and Style	WHEN we first reviewed Gaetano's in Hartford almost 14 years ago it was relatively new. At that time it specialized in Italian and French cuisines. Since then it has narrowed its focus, concentrating on Italian fare. It was clearly the right choice inasmuch as the restaurant is owned by Carbone's, a longtime Italian standby on the Hartford scene. Gaetano's is on the second floor of the Hartford Civic Center, in a vast space divided into a dark bar-cafe and a softly lighted two-tier dining room. The lower level has tables, upholstered chairs and booths beside large windows with commanding views. The raised dining area is punctuated by three glassed-in gazebos that seat 8 to 10 diners each and are used mostly by business groups at lunch. Muted blue-greens and browns are offset by a wine-color carpet. An entrance wall is lined with pictures of 19th-century Hartford.
1994-05-21	Making Sense of Cash-Back Card Plans	For some time, credit card issuers have bombarded prospective customers with promises of rebates on everything from cars to groceries to airline miles. So, it should come as no surprise that the issuers would eventually hit on the most valued gift of all -- cash. Last week, Chase Manhattan introduced a Cash Builder Visa card, which rewards card holders by paying them a percentage of their annual charges and finance fees in cash. Also last week, the GE Rewards Card started giving cash back on purchases. And in January Mellon Bank introduced a Cornerstone Mastercard, which refunds part of the finance charges to card holders. The grandfather of the cash-rebate programs is the Sears Discover card.
1994-05-15	French Menu, River View and Theater	RARELY have two buildings complemented each other so well as the Goodspeed Opera House and the adjacent Gelston House in East Haddam. Both are in Italianate style, perched grandly on a bluff above the Connecticut River. Having a place for his operagoers to eat and stay overnight was an important consideration to William Goodspeed when he chose a building site in 1883 (30 years after the inn opened). It is just as important today, and having the Gelston House reopened after a five-year hiatus is welcome news indeed. Being able to park behind the theater, dine at reasonable cost on the theater menu, then walk unhurriedly the few steps to the theater makes for a happy, stress-free outing. Even better news is that the Gelston House (now under the same ownership as Goodspeed) is first-rate.
1994-05-08	"DINING OUT;
Where the Cuisine Is French-Continental"	"A PEACH and white striped awning over the entrance identifies Pourquois Pas?, a nine-month-old restaurant just opposite the Ho-Ho-Kus Inn in the town of the same name.

Although the name implies that the food is French, Bernard Vard, the French-born chef and owner, doesn't want people to think he serves only French cuisine because that is often equated with small portions of fancy food. Instead, he defines it as French-Continental."
1994-05-08	A Cafe With Imaginative, Affordable Fare	THE passerby chancing upon the Good News Cafe, which is in a large, pale green frame house by the side of the main road in Woodbury, will find it a cheerful place: bright yellow walls hung with modern art (for sale), large windows framed by heavy green movers' blankets to muffle the high decibel level, tables and a double row of booths down the center. Pots of tulips and other fresh flowers line the top of the dividers between the rows of booths. A quick glance at the menu suggests that it is no roadside pancake house, despite its layout. What is not necessarily immediately apparent is the culinary talent of the proprietor, Carol Peck, who made a name for herself several years ago with a farmhouse restaurant in New Milford. Her style of wholesome, straightforward American cooking, using only fresh ingredients and combining them in imaginative ways, gives her dishes a signature.
1994-05-01	An Italian Hand With French Fare	IN Westport, the proprietors of Sol e Luna, a successful Italian restaurant, have created a French place, Brasserie St.-Germain, in a freestanding red brick building that has seen more than its share of restaurants in years past. Not only is the two-tier dining room appealing -- if austere, with bare wood floors, beige walls, and table tops that simulate wine cases -- but much of the food evokes the brasserie spirit. The same spirit (and food) can be found in a second room (to the left of the entry), where there are a few tables and display cases of pastries and take-out items. (The room is open from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. for coffee and pastry service.)
1994-04-29	Restaurants	"""My customers,"" says Nicola Marzovilla apologetically. He sighs, shrugs and looks to the heavens. Three enormous men, their bellies preceding them by a good two feet, have just pushed us aside in their rush for the door. Mr. Marzovilla glares at their departing backs and leads us to a round table in the corner. As he holds out a chair he murmurs, ""For you, Signora, the best table in the house."" He undoubtedly says this to every woman; that does not in the least dilute its charm. Mr. Marzovilla is a born restaurateur, a man of endless grace who wants to make everyone who walks through his door happy. He has great success."
1994-04-24	A Family-Friendly Spot in North Madison	THE name Noodles telegraphed two messages to us: pasta dishes and informality. And bingo! When we arrived at this small restaurant in the North Madison Shopping Plaza in North Madison, both messages turned out to be on target. Noodles, with a bar and a few tables in the front, is a cozy place with knotty pine pilasters and booths along one side, a few tables, decor that features fish prints, cutout wall signs, a dried floral wreath, framed portions of old quilts and other Americana, and a wait staff that is upbeat and welcoming. In short, the place is family-friendly, with the decibel level to prove it. The menu is wallet friendly as well, with filet mignon the highest priced entree on the menu at $13.95. Most entrees are in the $9.95-$10.95 range. As expected, pasta dishes dominate the short menu, but other choices include seafood, chicken, beef (filet and hamburger) and Danish pork ribs.

Most banks offer free checking if requirements for a minimum balance are met. The requirements are based either on an average of the daily balances during the statement period (generally about a month) or on a minimum daily balance (in which there is a charge if the balance drops below the required level at any time during the statement period).
1994-04-10	Going for the Gyoza in New Haven	JAPANESE restaurants are not a yen a dozen in Connecticut, so it is always a pleasure to welcome a new one. Samurai, in downtown New Haven, provides a pleasant dining experience in terms of both food and tranquil surroundings. There's nothing samurai-like or martial about the place, a two-story house across from the Shubert Theater with Japanese prints on pale yellow walls, a shoji screen at the entrance and huge white mulberry paper globes dangling from the ceiling in the two main dining rooms. The rooms, probably at one time the parlor and dining room of the house, lead into one another, and in a third room at the back, a long sushi bar dominates, with a sparkling array of fresh seafood. Up a long flight of mirror-lined stairs are additional dining rooms, well suited to private parties. Japanese waitresses in happi coats extend greetings at the entrance door.
1994-04-03	"DINING OUT;
Northern Italian and Grilled Items Too"	"READERS often ask why their favorite local Italian restaurants have not been reviewed on this page. The reason, of course, is that there are not enough weeks in the year to make a dent in the trove of neighborhood Italian eating places around the state.

The New Jersey Restaurant Association alone lists more than 220 Italian dining spots among its members, and that is far from the total number in the state. They range from pizza parlors to mom-and-pop storefronts and from slick new Tuscan grills to extravagantly formal establishments, but whatever the style, each one seems to have a devoted clientele."
1994-04-03	"DINING OUT;
Cozy Corner Spot Offers Contemporary Italian"	"IN the wake of a string of restaurants that have over the last few years met with only moderate success at this location comes Caffe Luna. This new spot offers a contemporary menu composed of small and large dishes -- bruschetta, salads and pasta as well as a generous handful of heartier entrees -- to be ordered according to the dictates of appetite. Judging from the crowds waiting for tables, it looks like a keeper. 

The restaurant, open two months, is still fine tuning, but in quite a few of the menu offerings, as well as in the tone of the place, Caffe Luna seems to have found the right balance."
1994-04-03	Eclectic Fare Fit for a Festive Evening	BY any standard, Gregory's Cafe and Bar in Fairfield is a delight to the eye. The decor is artfully simple: white wood wainscoting with gold-framed flower prints along the upper walls, wood floor with scattered Oriental rugs, well-designed wood chairs with rush seats, a banquette along one wall. Pinpoint ceiling lighting is soft but not dim, casting the room in a romantic glow. The total effect is pleasing and comfortable without upstaging the food. When we reviewed Gregory's 10 years ago, it was new, and we found it good but inconsistent. Its few tables (seating a total of 45, including a few tables in the rear bar) and uneven performance made us suspect it would have a short life span. A decade later, however, it remains, and the attractive look is much the same. The original owner, Reina Zuckerman, assumed the chef's mantle several years ago, culinary wrinkles have been ironed out, and Gregory's has become very good indeed.
1994-04-03	Back to Basics In the West Village	ANDALOUSIA ++ (212) 929-3693; 28 Cornelia Street, near West Fourth; $; Mastercard A charming Moroccan restaurant filled with ceramic curios and adorned with colorful tapestries, Andalousia specializes in aromatic North African dishes and serves some of the best couscous in town. Breewats -- small flaky pastries stuffed with fillings like sweet chicken stewed with dried lemons, a pea-and-carrot mixture or minced lamb -- are fine openers. There are also clean and fragrant salads, like hummus, grated carrots with raisins in a sweet orange marinade, and mashed eggplant with parsley, cumin and minced olives. The couscous is delicious, served with a variety of toppings, including steamed carrots, peas, zucchini and squash, spicy merguez, shredded chicken and tender chunks of stewed lamb. Excellent tagines -- Moroccan stews -- are served in traditional brown earthenware crocks; and B'stilla resembles a sweet chicken pot pie that is encased in phyllo with almonds and topped with a flaky crust seasoned with sugar and cinnamon.

We looked forward to returning to this restaurant, which interpreted the food of Thailand so deliciously. But while a number of dishes retained the textures and haunting flavors that make the cuisine so winning, it is sad to report some disappointments. The kitchen has become careless, and a few once-delectable items are now tough, overcooked or without character. Patrons can still dine royally at Siam Sea Grill; but to do so they must order the right dishes."

It is owned by Richard Widmaier-Picasso, a grandson of the artist. The food is straightforward, enticing bistro fare. Among better starters are warm leeks with shallot vinaigrette; eggplant custard with tomato coulis; onion soup; truffled chicken liver mousse; a salad of carrots and peas with beet juice, and a vegetable terrine of asparagus, spinach and mushrooms. Lusty main courses include pot-au-feu of veal, beef and vegetables with stuffed cabbage and bone marrow; grilled sirloin with a pepper and cognac sauce; duck confit with sauteed potatoes; mussels mariniere with leeks and saffron, and a light brandade of morue, the garlicky cod and potato puree.

1994-03-27	Assessing an Old Favorite, Chinese Food	CHINESE food is among a handful of first-rate international cuisines. Unfortunately, as served in so many restaurants, this diverse, complex and inventive cuisine is rarely at its best, rarely even at second best. So clonelike have the area's Chinese restaurants become, we rarely anticipate a new one. It is a sad admission, inasmuch as Chinese food has been among our all-time favorites since the long-ago time when we lived in Asia. That said, we approached Hunan Spring in Stamford, with more than a little trepidation. The location was familiar, the site of a French, then briefly a Thai restaurant. In its current metamorphosis the decor is simpler: a large room, with smoking and nonsmoking areas, pale pink walls adorned with a few watercolors, well-spaced tables, neatly napped with white cloths and pink napkins, and comfortable chairs with shiny black lacquered high-backs. All in all, understated and comfortable, enhanced by a cordial, accommodating staff.

The workers, who collect delinquent payments from holders of Citicorp's Visa and Mastercard credit cards, learned this week that their jobs will be eliminated by July. ""Over the last year, we've seen our credit card delinquencies drop quite a bit and because of that reason, there's some excess capacity,"" a Citicorp spokeswoman, Maria Rullo, said. Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, with $216.6 billion in assets, has pledged to keep annual expenses below $10 billion, or less than the almost 62 cents for every revenue dollar spent last year."

Sprint argued that World Cup USA had sold it the right to be the exclusive calling card. But Mastercard asserted that such a card was not distinctly different from its product.

Eclectic Food in Mammoth Portions"	"""I GO through about 400 to-go containers a week,"" said Neil West, the chef and owner of Neil's, in the Ocean County township of Brick. That's because the portions of eclectic fare at this casually attractive new restaurant are mammoth enough for the Giants' training table.

Not every dish works -- veal with peppers may be swamped with brown sauce, or a piece of fish may verge on being overcooked -- but for an area near the Shore that's not known for serious dining, Neil's is a welcome addition with above-average food and service."
1994-03-20	"DINING OUT;
A Place for All Seasons on the Edge of Long Pond"	"IF first impressions count, Long Pond Inn is a winner in any season. Considering the restaurant's position on the edge of Long Pond, we had always considered this a summer place, the deck a lovely spot for a drink or sorbets and after-dinner coffee with a long look at the pond disturbed, perhaps, only by a silent canoe. But Long Pond Inn has another season, one we had overlooked. From the parking lot on a recent frigid winter's night the windows of the secluded cabin glowed welcome with candle- and firelight. Beyond the heavy oak entry doors we cozied up in fat chairs by the fireplace before entering the main dining room separated from the bar by a pretty etched glass divider.

It may be, however, that for food, Long Pond Inn is essentially a fair-weather restaurant. Winter found the kitchen uneven. Perhaps the kitchen's interest decreases along with the number of diners. Whatever the reason, the few diners braving the cold deserve better."
1994-03-20	In the 70's and 80's, Food for the 90's	AMSTERDAM'S BAR AND ROTISSERIE * (212) 874-1377; 428 Amsterdam Avenue, near 81st Street; $$; all major credit cards This popular spot serves simple, comforting American food, with rotisserie-cooked poultry, lamb and fish at moderate prices in a relaxed setting. The rectangular two-tier space has a long bar in front and an elevated dining room in the back with whitewashed brick walls, a black tin ceiling and tightly clustered cafe tables. Among current starters are the gravlax with onion, capers and a tangy dill mustard sauce; sesame-and-ginger noodles with coriander and snow peas, and an antipasto plate for two combining roasted peppers and mushrooms, marinated eggplant, fresh mozzarella and lentils. Main courses might include roasted half chicken with french fries; roasted loin of pork with porcini mushroom sauce, garlic mashed potatoes and grilled radicchio, and roasted marinated leg of lamb with garlic and rosemary. Children 10 years old and younger are served a free dinner all evening on Sunday and until 7 P.M. Monday through Friday; a $3 donation toward a children's charity is requested.

1994-03-18	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; CBS may be losing other sports, but March Madness still causes it to cheer.	MARCH Madness -- the name given to the National Collegiate Athletic Association's men's basketball tournament that began yesterday -- is a kind of divine lunacy for CBS. Big advertisers pour mass quantities of money into the event. And CBS doesn't have to beg companies to buy in or trash its rate card.
1994-03-13	Where Grape Leaves Grace the Table	LEBANESE cuisine is one of the liveliest in the Middle East. Unfortunately, it is rarely found in the United States outside major urban centers. Danbury, with its sizable Lebanese population, is an exception. Now, with the arrival of Hanna's Mid-Eastern Restaurant, the city can boast of not one, but two full-fledged Lebanese establishments (Roland's of Lebanon opened several years ago) as well as the long-established Sesame Seed, which also serves Middle Eastern dishes. One feels the spirit of Lebanon on arrival in small, tidy Hanna's (the owner's last name), with the rhythms of taped Middle Eastern music in the background. The dining room is simple but attractive with white stucco walls, natural pine wainscoting, comfortable modern chairs and well-spaced tables covered with pink cloths and dubonnet napkins.
1994-03-06	"DINING OUT;
Where to Go for Authentic Japanese Fare"	"IN Japan, it's considered a sign of enjoyment to slurp your noodles. As is done when sipping piping hot Japanese soup, one is supposed to suck in the noodles quickly with a cooling intake of breath before they become limp in the broth.

A good place to practice is at Shinwa, just off the Palisades Parkway in the Bergen County community of Alpine. One of the specialties of this coolly luxurious restaurant is Japanese noodle dishes. Soba, or buckwheat noodles, and udon, the wheat noodles, are made there by hand daily, and even the paper chopstick covers urge diners to ""please eat slurping briskly them in the traditional Japanese manner."""
1994-03-06	Off Broadway: Food's the Thing	BARBETTA * (212) 246-9171; 321 West 46th Street; $$$$; all major credit cards The town-house setting at this Northern Italian restaurant is stunning, with its 18th-century Piedmontese crystal chandelier dominating the grand main dining room, silk drapes, brocade-upholstered chairs and tuxedoed waiters. Barbetta offers a $39 pre-theater menu. Appetizers include a soup of carrots and broccoli, roasted beet salad, meat-and-cheese-filled tortellini with Alfredo sauce, and handmade tagliarini with a tomato-and-basil sauce. Among the entrees are braised rabbit in white wine with mushrooms and leeks; charcoal-grilled sirloin, sliced and served with an herbed vinaigrette, and sauteed veal kidneys with a red wine sauce. (Review: 1/22/93)
1994-03-06	In Southport, the Sonoma Valley Style	NEW restaurants usually require a period of time before getting up to speed in staff and kitchen performance. It has not been necessary at Sonoma California Grille, which opened recently in Southport. Perhaps because the newcomer is the offspring of Spazzi, on the Post Road in Fairfield, with that restaurant's experience to draw on, Sonoma California Grille has hit the ground running. On recent visits, we were surprised to find both the food and cheerful, upbeat service exemplary. There was not a glitch in sight. But be forewarned: The vast dining space, though elaborately renovated with wide-angle views of a huge modern kitchen, can seem glum and off-putting. Its mustard-color sponge-painted walls, dark cherrywood trim and slatted panels (to lower the ceiling), bare black wood tables and chairs with green plastic seats make it resemble a noisy cafeteria more than a quiet Sonoma Valley inn. But the tables are well-spaced and, at almost the moment we sat down, our waiter deposited a plate of piping hot refried black beans punctuated with spicy flat bread (brushed with kosher salt and jalapeno oil), which was delicious.
1994-03-05	Credit Card Goodies, With Lower Interest	MANY credit cards now offer goodies, from frequent-flier miles to discounts on cars and candy bars. Tempting as they may be, these cards are not always great deals. That's because the cards with the perks often carry higher interest rates than those without. Some people, of course, pay their bills every month and lap up the bonuses. But most people -- even those who say they pay their bills -- occasionally borrow money on their cards.
1994-02-27	"DINING OUT;
Mixing and Matching, Italian Style, in Irvington"	"AS its name suggests, Il Sorriso will indeed bring out the diner's smile. Following the trend subscribed to by many other newly opened restaurants, Il Sorriso offers a variety of dishes that can be mixed and matched according to the diner's appetite. But this restaurant has even more going for it -- food that can be uncommonly good and a classy ambiance. 

Our conservative rating at this time takes into account rough spots that need work, problems that often plague young establishments. Some dishes arrive unaccountably bland or overcooked. The nonsmoking area is next to the unpartitioned bar where people smoke, and service can be disorganized, harried or forgetful. But the top-notch dishes the kitchen is able to turn out and the attentive service from most of the serving staff indicate that this restaurant has serious potential. It's clear that everyone wants to please."
1994-02-27	When an Italian Place Moves Upscale	"ANOTHER Italian restaurant? Yes, indeed, and when it is as good as Mare e Monte in Greenwich, there's reason to cheer. The newcomer, subtitled ""Ristorante Toscano,"" is on the site of Da Vinci's, an old-fashioned family-style pizza place and has the same ownership. But the sweeping changes are all for the better. Mare e Monte is stylishly cool looking, with white walls, black trim, mirrors, murals and deep-blue touches in chairs, table aprons and draperies. The smoking and non-smoking sections seem to fluctuate as demand dictates, from the large main dining room to a smaller, cozy room near the bar. Softly lighted at night, the main room is bright, light and cheery by day, with sunshine flooding in from the large front windows."
1994-02-20	Pondering the Possibilities With Pasta	PASTA VERA has weathered a fire and a move and is now in new quarters in the heart of things on Greenwich Avenue in Greenwich. The move has brought a sleek new look to the restaurant. The glass-front display case with take-out dishes (mostly pasta and salads) is near the entrance. In the rear is a large dining area, stylishly low-key in charcoal gray and white, with a few touches of black in the bentwood chairs and wire bread baskets. Architectural drawings of Italian buildings decorate the gray walls, and charcoal gray and white tiles line the floor.
1994-02-13	When Steak Is What a Diner Desires	IT is our view that usually places that specialize in steak are like Gertrude Stein's line about a rose: a steakhouse is a steakhouse is a steakhouse. Anyone interested usually finds such a restaurant without our help. But what makes us point out Charlie B's Steakhouse in New Haven are its location and its value. Anyone visiting the city for museums or theater-going will find this new restaurant right in the center of things, just a block from the Yale Repertory Theater and the Yale Art Gallery. Even the most resolute quiche-eaters occasionally crave a good, tender hunk of meat and toss cholesterol worries to the wind.
1994-02-06	A Cafe Menu in a Victorian-Inspired Setting	LIKE that manic toy bunny in television advertisements, Westport's Hay Day, the produce store and deli, keeps on going, or rather, growing. It has moved to a larger location on the other side of the Post Road, with ample room for adding a new restaurant, called Hay Day Market Cafe. The new cafe -- two large rooms, plus a barroom with tables -- has an 1880's Victorian look, with lace-curtained windows, a pressed-tin ceiling, tulip glass sconces, pink brocade-like wallpaper, wood pilasters and bentwood chairs. Columns with gilded capitals highlight the center door.
1994-01-30	"DINING OUT;
A Taste of the Southwest in Tarrytown"	"THE massive wood door and arched windows of this casual storefront restaurant have for the last 10 years attracted diners to the Tex-Mex fare served within. Seemingly timed to celebrate this anniversary month, Santa Fe has built an addition, the nifty New Mexico Room, a serene, airy space away from the smoky bar area. Ropes of dried red chilies and Indian corn, Southwestern artifacts, an adobe half wall, nicely spaced tables and greenery, in particular the tree marking the center of the room, make this a pleasant spot in which to dine, an opinion shared by the many who fill the place by 8 P.M.

The long menu offers a range of dishes from snacks to generous entrees. And beans, creamy rice, shredded greens and other appropriate garnishes accompany most dishes. The food is undeniably heavy, and a little goes a long way. Diners thinking about having dessert should, if they can resist, go easy on the fresh, crisp tortilla chips and bowl of excellent salsa brought to every table. Don't expect the salsa to deliver tongue-searing, flavor-concealing heat. Instead, Santa Fe's extremely mild red salsa packs lots of flavor, of good tomatoes and fresh cilantro."
1994-01-30	A New Menu With a New Focus in Canaan	"NO hype, no hoopla, no press releases. All the Cannery in Canaan has to offer is delicious, expertly prepared food at moderate prices (no entree more than $18, most between $11 and $15), excellent service that pays attention to details without being intrusive and a low-key atmosphere that is congenial but not splashy. All this adds up to a real sleeper in the northwest corner of the state. In a former life as the Cannery Cafe, the emphasis was on Cajun food. With a new name (goodbye to the word ""cafe""), a new subtitle (""An American Bistro""), refreshed decor (lighter, more elegant) and new ownership (chef William O'Meara from Apricots in Farmington and Lisa Sullivan, dessert chef at the previous Cannery and this one as well), the new Cannery also offers a new menu."
1994-01-25	No Headline	Companies Executives and trustees of Green Point Savings Bank will not be allowed to receive compensation estimated to be worth more than $85 million in connection with its proposed initial public stock offering.

1994-01-25	Mastercard Chief to Go To Advanta	"Mastercard International Inc. said yesterday that Alex W. Hart, its president and chief executive, would leave in March to join a leading bank card issuer, the Advanta Corporation, as executive vice chairman and a member of the board. Mr. Hart, 53, who is credited with reversing Mastercard's declining share of the credit card market in five years at the helm, said he was leaving because he missed ""the excitement and exhilaration"" of building a business."
1994-01-25	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Tinkering with success, Visa tries to create new, invigorating installments of a longtime campaign.	"SINCE 1985, Visa has been proclaiming, through advertising by BBDO New York, that ""It's everywhere you want to be."" But where does Visa want to be?"
1994-01-23	"DINING OUT;
A Change of Chefs at a Stylish Bistro"	"NEW owners and a change of chefs have wrought some welcome improvements at Amanda's, a three-year-old restaurant in Hoboken, thus moving it up a notch on the ratings scale. With a bit more finesse in both the food and service, however, this smart little bistro could be the city's most felicitous restaurant.

Visually, it already is. The three small dining rooms are lined up, one behind the other, resembling the first floor of a casually elegant town house. The walls have a handsome sponged finish in warm beige tones, the ceilings are high and french doors look out on a pocket garden. In front is a mirror-backed mahogany bar, and the back room has the look of a library with trompe l'oeil wallpaper of book-filled shelves. It all adds up to a timeless charm. A tiny side room that seats 12 can be used for a private party."
1994-01-23	Satisfying Brunches for Wintry Sundays	AN UPBEAT remedy for winter's cabin fever is to go out for Sunday brunch. Brunch is pleasant any season, of course, but in winter the leisurely and cozy aspects of it seem especially suitable indoors. There is another good argument for going out for Sunday brunch -- an economic one. Often a three- or four-course prix-fixe brunch is a relatively inexpensive way to entertain.
1994-01-23	East Village Spices At Gentle Prices	AL HAMRA ++ (212) 505-6559; 203 First Avenue, near 12th Street; $; no credit cards This unassuming Indian restaurant does not provide much decor or atmosphere, but it offers a solid repertory of satisfying, familiar fare at bargain prices. Portions are enormous and cost less than $5. The dining room has a grayish linoleum floor, folk murals on one wall, wobbly tables covered with plastic, and track lighting overhead. The food comes with paper plates and plastic utensils. Two good starters are samosas, peppery potatoes and peas wrapped in a crisp crust; and shami kebab, grilled patties of minced goat, lentils and scallions with cinnamon and cardamom. Entrees include savory chicken karahi, shredded boneless chicken with peas, Basmati rice and spices; tender spicy chicken curry, and moist piquant chapli kebabs, grilled minced lamb and herbs. The menu also carries almost a dozen vegetarian dishes. All main courses are served with a lettuce, cucumber and tomato salad and raita, an herbed yogurt mixture. ($25 and Under: 6/11/93)
1994-01-16	A Complex Menu, Simple Decor in Cos Cob	IN Cos Cob quarters formerly occupied by a long-playing French restaurant, Le Shack, the Mill Pond Cafe has opened. As the name cafe suggests, the decor is simple, with a wood partition separating the small dining room and bar area. Wood tables and chairs, and all wood surfaces are rubbed with a blend of gray and teal green that matches the carpet. Windows cover most of the wall facing Mill Pond, an inlet off the Mianus River.

1994-01-09	"DINING OUT;
A Chinese Kitchen and a Sushi Bar"	"A CHINESE kitchen paired with a sushi bar is an increasingly popular restaurant combination around New Jersey -- handy for those who can't agree on what kind of meal they're in the mood for. One of the newest of such spots is Hillary's, in the Union County town of Springfield. Kenny and Amy Luong, the owners, named the restaurant not after Hillary Rodham Clinton but after their daughter, now 22 months old. 

Since January is traditionally the month for belt tightening, fiscal and gastronomic, moderately priced Asian eating places like these are especially appealing. This neighborhood restaurant, in a small shopping center next to a Foodtown, has an open, contemporary look and a cordial, genuinely accommodating staff. Its word-of-mouth popularity, like that of Chen's in New Providence and Edo in Pennington, means that having a choice of Asian cuisines under one roof strikes a chord with diners."
1994-01-09	An Informal Bistro With an Elegant Touch	THE most recent change at the old Union League Club of New Haven has seen the elegant Robert Henry's restaurant on the premises metamorphose into the more casual Union League Cafe. Much as we lament the passing of one of the state's most distinguished restaurants, the new establishment, owned and run by the daughter of the previous Robert Henry's and her husband, the chef, is perhaps more in keeping with mid-1990's eating fashions and prices.
1994-01-05	"COMPANY NEWS;
Citibank-Apple Card Offers Discount Toward Computers"	"Citibank and Apple Computer Inc. yesterday introduced joint Mastercards and Visa credit cards that provide rebates on Apple products to customers. 

Analysts said the venture, which links the nation's largest bank card issuer with the second-largest computer manufacturer, was intended by Citibank to regain a larger share of the market in the increasingly competitive credit card industry, and for Apple to increase sales."
1993-12-30	The Carpet Man Fulfills a Promise; With Guns-for-Toys Program, Fernando Mateo Succeeds at Last	"The toys-for-gun man, so deluged by claims on his time, was hardly able to ponder wall-to-walls or cut-piles, though it was his success in floor coverings that made his goodness possible. ""I'm going crazy, but it's a good kind of crazy,"" he said, settled behind his carpet store desk, which was strewn with phone messages. The phone and his beeper trilled simultaneously. He scooped up the phone."
1993-12-20	For Shoppers, A Fast Flight To Paradise	Eighty of the 133 people aboard the 8 A.M. flight from Grand Rapids, Mich., and hundreds more passengers from Milwaukee and Omaha and Cleveland and elsewhere, landed at the Minneapolis-St.Paul International Airport this morning with a single purpose in life. They did not have the expectant, searching eyes of a traveler meeting a loved one. They did not look up for the signs for baggage claim. They were not wearing coats; they would not be needing them, even in December in Minnesota.
1993-12-19	Culinary Getaways For a Tired Shopper	SEA GRILL * (212) 246-9201; 19 West 49th Street, at Rockefeller Center; $$$; all major credit cards
1993-12-19	Bistro Fare and Stylish Decor in Litchfield	WEST STREET GRILL in Litchfield does not need any more kudos. Thanks to the glitter of big name weekenders in the Litchfield Hills, the likes of Tom Brokaw, Henry Kissinger and a cast of hundreds, this four-year-old restaurant seemingly does a land-office business. The remarkable thing is that a restaurant that has had such a barrage of extravagant press coverage manages to keep its consistency level high. Even more amazing is that in the interim West Street Grill has actually improved. When it lost its main chef and key service personnel some months ago, there were questions about what would happen next. What happened is this: the restaurant is better now than it has ever been, and the stylish, low-key black-and-white decor, mirrored and brick walls and bleached maple floor are just as appealing as ever.
1993-12-18	Holiday Shoppers Are Whipping Out the Plastic	Retailers and credit card companies say shoppers are charging more purchases this holiday season, a sign of improving consumer confidence. The volume of retail sales cleared through Mastercard's network jumped almost 20 percent between the day after Thanksgiving and last Friday. Over the last weekend, Visa processed about 850 transactions in its peak second, beating out 811 calls in last year's peak second, which fell on the Saturday before Christmas.
1993-12-17	Diner's Journal	"New Year's Eve What are you doing New Year's Eve? The Rainbow Room's 275 places at $375 each are already taken, but other choices are still available, from quiet little dinners to blowouts. A cabaret at the Ballroom for $60, a Champagne dinner at CIII for $50, one at Park Avenue Cafe for $75, dinner and dancing at Tatou for $175 to $250, the same at the ""21"" Club for $275 and a dinner dance at the Waldorf-Astoria for $395 are a few. When you make New Year's Eve reservations you may be asked for a credit card number. ""We take the credit card number to put in a person's mind that they will be charged if they don't show up,"" said Brad Reynolds, the director of operations at the ""21"" Club. But the cardholder is under no obligation to pay a restaurant charge that was not authorized in writing. Representatives of Visa and Mastercard said their companies had no system for recording restaurant charges made by telephone."
1993-12-17	Restaurants	"When I was a waitress I had two recurring nightmares. One was about the customer who keeps calling, ""Miss! Oh, miss!,"" waving wildly. ""In a minute,"" I say over and over, but somehow I never make it to the table. The other dream was about fish."
1993-12-12	Holiday Meals That Come With Merriment	Not all holiday galas are pegged to hearth and home. Dining out can be just as celebratory, particularly if the restaurant makes a special festive effort, as those included here do. Their Christmas dinner programs are popular, so you would be well advised to reserve early. It doesn't get much more convivial than the Elizabethan holiday evening at the Golden Lamb Buttery in Brooklyn in the northeastern corner of the state. First there is a hayride in the crisp December air, which may sound hokey, but it turns out to be fun. A personable guitarist, Susan Lamb, sings holiday songs on the ride. Bob Booth, the host, drives the tractor that pulls the hay wagon and sweeps a high-powered light over the fields in search of wildlife. During our 10-minute ride we saw five deer gamboling beside a stone wall. Our other sighting was more domestic: a herd of sheep grazing in the moonlight.
1993-12-05	Informal Cuisine in a Lush Hotel Atrium	"SEVERAL months ago the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Old Greenwich closed its upscale restaurant Conde's (except for private parties) and is now ""making do"" with its second-tier eating place, Winfield's Cafe, in keeping with current lighter, more informal dining habits. Conde's was part of a 1980's national trend toward small, gourmet-style restaurants that many hotel chains embraced. Economic times and changing eating patterns have been hard on such efforts. Winfield's Cafe is situated in the vast 56-foot-high glass-roof atrium that is the hotel's centerpiece. Towering columns covered by climbing greenery, ficus trees, hibiscus, philodendron and other plants, a small pond, streams and waterfall all add to the appeal. In the evening, the sound of live piano music drifts over from a small bar across the way."
1993-12-05	Profile: Bernie Feiwus; A Successful Match: Quirky Catalogue, Offbeat Executive	"A NEW black-and-gold flag snaps in the wind that blows more or less constantly across the Trinity River basin outside Dallas, home base for NM Direct, Neiman Marcus's mail-order division. The flag is a fitting symbol of NM Direct and its chief executive, B. D. (Bernie) Feiwus. ""It's kind of like the flag of a pirate ship,"" he said."
1993-11-28	"DINING OUT;
Mexican Fare With Dashes of Adventure"	"FROM Afghan to Vietnamese, New Jersey boasts a wealth of intriguing ethnic eating places, but a really good and authentic Mexican restaurant has somehow eluded it. 

Part of the reason for the general mediocrity of the state's Mexican-American eating places is that no one expects very much of them. Keep it cheap, cheerful and filling seems to be all that is asked, and bring on the margaritas and the beer. In the search for something more, countless dishes have been sampled, one almost indistinguishable from the other, but all of them sharing a puddle of refried beans and a blanket of bland cheese. Common faults of these Tex-Mex kitchens are preparing too many dishes in advance and overcooking."
1993-11-28	Home-Style Appeal in a Victorian Setting	ALEIA'S (the maiden name of the owners' mother), adds new dining luster to Westbrook. Inside an inviting white frame Victorian house with shutters, a green awning and gas street lights, the large dining room is on the subdued side, with dark green carpeting, dark wood paneling and wainscoting. White lace curtains at the windows and chipper hand-painted renderings of vegetables on the walls help brighten up the place, but even the ceiling spots and glass-shaded lights hung over many tables do not completely relieve the dim look. But that should not deter you from a really pleasurable dining experience, enhanced by well-trained and cheerful staff work. The Italian-accented menu contains many current hot-button items, prepared authoritatively and with home-style appeal.
1993-11-23	Dean Witter Gets Entry to Mastercard	Ending one of the most bitter battles in the credit-card business, Mastercard International said yesterday that it would allow the rival Dean Witter, Discover & Company to sponsor a Mastercard credit card. In a compromise, Dean Witter would offer the card jointly with an existing Mastercard member, Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C. They will split the expenses and the revenues of the product, which will be introduced early next year.
1993-11-21	"DINING OUT;
Eclectic Fare, and the Prices Are Right"	"RESTAURANTS without liquor licenses often provide the best value for diners, but finding one where the food is good yet prices are fair is not always easy. 

Fiddlehead's Restaurant, a small storefront seating 54 in simple surroundings, with Formica-topped tables but cloth napkins, fits the profile. The one-room Middlesex County irestaurant s decorated with paintings, wall sculptures and pottery made by Linda Collura, an artist who is the wife of the chef and owner, Larry Collura."
1993-11-21	French Cuisine in Experienced Hands	LE CHAMPIGNON, a new French restaurant in Stamford, joins Indian, Mexican, Austrian and Italian/Cajun restaurants, turning the short block of Summer Street between West Broad and Park into a veritable international restaurant row. In spacious quarters formerly occupied by a nightclub, Le Champignon has been broken into several attractive areas, with smoking and nonsmoking sections. The well-spaced, nicely napped tables (set with fresh flowers) are enhanced by soft lighting, creamy walls and dark wood wainscoting and pilasters. Pictures of mushrooms on the walls are reminders of the restaurant name.
1993-11-14	"DINING OUT;
A Neighborhood Spot Fit for the 90's"	"THE Heights Cafe is a charming vest-pocket eating place that is just what a neighborhood spot should be for the 90's. Tucked at the end of a strip mall in Berkeley Heights, near the new Kings Super Market, it is an attractive but relaxed setting for tasty, health-conscious cooking at reasonable prices. 

It's the close attention to details at this five-month-old Union County spot that makes the difference. With pleasant lighting and fresh flowers on green faux marble tables and interesting artwork on the walls paired with attentive yet unobtrusive service, the ambiance is more sophisticated than its cramped setting next to a pizza shop would lead you to expect. Phil Cerciello, the proprietor, keeps a close eye on things."
1993-11-14	Technology; Taking the Worry Out of Paying With Plastic	STANDING in line to buy a sweater, you wait for the little credit-card machine to clear your purchase. Finally, the machine reaches its erroneous decision: You're a deadbeat. No sweater. Visa and Mastercard want you never to live through that embarrassment again. Behind the scenes, both companies have begun improving their vast credit-card transaction networks to eliminate the billing mistakes responsible for many of those checkout-counter blunders. They also hope that better validation procedures can greatly reduce credit-card fraud.
1993-11-14	Those Mind-Boggling Promotions	AMERICANS' love of a bargain notwithstanding, consumers are getting fed up with the increasingly complex promotions being served up by corporate marketing departments. The often dizzying lists of conditions, choices and partners in today's promotions -- a loose term for incentives that typically give shoppers something in addition to the basic product -- leave many people feeling they need an accountant's eyeshade to scour ads for savings.
1993-11-10	The Food, You Can Be Proud to Say, Is in the Mail	CHEESECAKES and chocolate cakes, ice creams and butter creams, goat cheese and sheep cheese. In hot pursuit of the best food available by mail, somewhere in the neighborhood of 8,000 samples (well, make it 16,000) have passed my lips over the last dozen years. Some of those flavors have remained in my taste memory, and I thought that this year, instead of searching for 20 new items, which are getting harder and harder to find, I would include the best of the old, along with the best of the new. In the early 1980's the original mail-order foods -- Day-Glo orange cheeses, unspeakable fruitcakes, frozen steaks and unripened pears -- began to meet delicious foreign and local competition. Unlike the fruitcake that makes its way around the world year after year, barbecue, champagne truffles, smoked salmon and lemon cake have made gifts by mail something to be anticipated, not dreaded.
1993-11-07	Profile: Laura S. Scher; She Took One Look At the Age of Greed And Made a Quick Left	"LAURA S. SCHER graduated from Harvard Business School near the top of her class in 1985, smack in the middle of the Decade of Greed. Most of her classmates were seduced by the gaudy salaries and vainglorious life style of Wall Street. But not Ms. Scher, who was ""put off by the idea of making so much money, by the insane hours, the New York life and the cultishness of it"" and whose career goals included ""wanting to do something I could believe in."""
1993-10-31	"DINING OUT;
Dishes From Turkey at Bargain Prices"	"BEHIND the modest storefront facade of Beyti Kebab in Union City lies the unexpected. First, there's a retail meat counter and glass case displaying Middle Eastern food. Beyond that is a long, open dining room brightly illuminated by no fewer than 10 crystal chandeliers and lively with the sounds of taped Turkish music and the bilingual chatter of diners.

Off to the side is a banquet hall where an American belly dancer named Ayse performs fetchinglyon Saturday nights with a spirited duo."
1993-10-31	Grilled Fare in Handsome Surroundings	"PLEASE notice that this review does not begin with words like ""Well, pardner, out yonder at the Rattlesnake Bar & Grill in South Norwalk . . ."" When the menu headings are Snake bites (appetizers), Buckaroo Burgers, Sagebrush & Tumbleweed (salads) and Serious Grub (entrees), it is easy to fall into Old West palaver. The decor features a bleached cow skull and a larger-than-life snake sculpture whose glittery mosaic-skinned body winds itself along the top of the long bar in the main dining room. Less hokey and actually quite attractive is the natural wood structure, suggesting rafters, in front of and above the bar, from which hangs a series of colorful Indian rugs, reminiscent of a Southwestern lodge."
1993-10-30	Tough Balancing Act at Loehmann's	When Loehmann's, the discount stores of choice for generations of thrifty fashion mavens, posted signs brandishing designers' names, added more lower-priced women's clothing, and stopped removing labels, many customers were not appreciative. They were outraged. They missed the thrill of hunting for the elusive designer original, the feeling of power when they could decipher the code on a tag that told them they had bagged a Bill Blass.
1993-10-29	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; One actor can hawk in many tongues, most of them firmly in cheek.	WHEN Woody Allen did it, audiences roared. Marni Nixon made a career of it. Milli Vanilli did it, but got caught. Now Madison Avenue is eagerly embracing it. The subject in question is the use of lip-synching and dubbing, production techniques by which the voices of actors or singers are replaced by the voices of unseen other people. When the performers on screen move their lips, the audience actually hears the voices of the talent offscreen.
1993-10-27	Visa International Is Set To Replace Top Officer	The longtime chief executive of Visa International, Charles Russell, will announce today that he is resigning from the credit card organization. He will be replaced by Edmund P. Jensen, a vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp in Portland, Ore. News of the change, which was not expected, was distributed by Visa by facsimile to its member banks late last night. The board of Visa is meeting in Buhl, Germany.
1993-10-26	Ogilvy & Mather Drops Shell as Client	Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide said yesterday that its Houston office had resigned a new credit card account from the Shell Oil Company, citing a conflict with American Express, a client of Ogilvy in New York. Shell billings were estimated at $5 million to $10 million. Mary Churchill, an Ogilvy spokeswoman in New York, confirmed a report of the resignation in Advertising Age this week. She said that Promotional Campaigns Worldwide of London was opening an office in Houston to serve the account. Promotional Campaigns, which, like Ogilvy, is owned by the WPP Group, works for Shell in seven other countries.
1993-10-19	Shell Joins Chemical on Credit Card	The Shell Oil Company and the Chemical Bank will offer a joint Mastercard on Nov. 1 under which drivers will be able to save 3 percent when they buy Shell gasoline or 2 percent on other purchases for rebates of up to $70 a year on Shell gasoline purchases. After they reach $70 a year in savings, customers could then get only 1 percent off their purchases of Shell gasoline.
1993-10-17	"DINING OUT;
Engaging Spot for French Country Fare"	"IN an eagerness to try out new places, a long-running little gem is sometimes overlooked.  Take Chez Madeleine, a congenial shoe box of a bistro next to a billiard hall in the Bergen County community of Bergenfield.

This unassuming storefront, which was last reviewed when it opened four and a half years ago, continues to offer wonderful French country fare to its steady clientele while upstart dining spots open and then close around it. The dozen or so tables are usually booked weeks ahead for the two seatings on Saturday nights, and reservations are a good idea for the other nights of the week."
1993-10-17	John J. Reynolds Is Dead at 70; Banker Developed the Mastercard	John J. Reynolds, the developer of the Mastercard, died on Thursday at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, L.I. He was 70, and had lived in Garden City, L.I. Mr. Reynolds died of heart failure, said his daughter, Dianne Reynolds.
1993-10-17	Ethnic Dishes in a Traditional Setting	AS a restaurant town, Danbury frequently surprises us, both for its ethnic range and its modest prices, among the lowest in Fairfield County. New to the Danbury scene (since June) is David's Cafe, which follows the local pattern of moderate prices. In its menu, David's Cafe follows no single ethnic theme, but offers Italian, French, Cajun and Asian dishes, as well as several cross-cultural combinations. Descriptions of some dishes sounded curious, but turned out to be more conventional (and often far better) in reality.
1993-10-07	At Visa, New Quest for U.S. Growth	When Carl F. Pascarella abruptly replaced H. Robert Heller as president of Visa U.S.A. in late August, he became the third person to hold that job in less than four years. Some of the turnover may stem from the difficulties of 63-year-old Charles T. Russell, the president of Visa International, the parent organization, to settle on a successor. But this latest change clearly stems, too, from the growing pressures on Visa.
1993-10-03	"DINING OUT;
A Menu of East-West Fusion Cooking"	"AT the Canton Grill, a sleekly handsome Mercer County newcomer at the foot of Palmer Square in Princeton, the eclectic menu gives new meaning to fusion cooking. Dishes range from tempura to Cajun chicken sandwiches and from Shanghai lobster to Jamaican wings. 

The spacious 120-seat dining room in serene tones of beige and hunter green has booths, pleasant lighting and handsomely set tables that overlook a patio through a wall of windows. More tables surround a fountain for casual dining al fresco -- a nice addition to the university town. The grill was opened by William Ho, Princeton '84, and his father, who also operates several Chinese eating places in Manhattan, including Chef Ho's Dumpling House in Chinatown."
1993-10-03	An Elegant Place for a Seafood Lunch	WHEN we heard several months ago that Cafe du Bec Fin in Old Greenwich was eliminating its dinner service and converting its main dining room to a fish store, to be called Bec Fin Fish Market and Cafe, we were dismayed. Few good seafood restaurants exist in Connecticut, and since 1986 it has been one of the very best. But, seafood fanciers, we are delighted to report that all is not lost. Bec Fin continues to serve lunch every day but Sunday, and an elegant lunch it is. Incorporating the words fish market in its title suggests something less than fancy, but the chef and owner, Joseph Cizynski, has kept intact the front part of his restaurant (where lunch was always served), with a stucco half-wall separating it from the glass display cases of the shop. The cafe is a bright and cozy place for lunch, with a blue tiled floor, blue and white Mexican tile trim on creamy stucco walls and cafe curtains at the windows. There is seating for 20 at well-spaced, well-napped tables set with blue and white Villeroy & Boch china and fresh roses. And at the end of lunch each woman diner is still presented with a single rose, a reminder that lunch can be as comely as dinner. Service is as careful and the staff as well-trained as ever. A mural depicts cafe life at Moulin Rouge. The French theme is appropriate, for Chef Cizynski's skills are French-based, with a few Asian accents and ingredients.
1993-09-26	Diverse Fare Where Tellers Once Reigned	RESTAURANTS on Washington Street in South Norwalk have clustered on the south side but the new Amberjacks is on the north side in space once occupied by the Connecticut National Bank. All traces of the bank are gone except for the legacy of a vast space, center columns and high ceilings. Amberjacks has painted the ceiling dark blue to suggest a sky, with tiny star-shape lights twinkling overhead. The walls have been sponged a neutral creamy tone; sails with marine signal flags are draped along one wall for a suggestion of the sea. Banquettes in a dark blue fabric line both sides of the wide room, while the front of the building is given over to a bar. On our visits, the bar was hopping, mostly with younger patrons, though the recorded music that wafts through the room is varied enough to satisfy most age groups.
1993-09-19	"DINING OUT;
A Lively Trattoria With Stylish Decor"	"JUDGING by the instant popularity of the sleek new Grissini Trattoria, the Bergen County crowd has finally found a casually stylish SoHo clone to call its own. At prime hours, people stand four deep at the polished marble bar to see and be seen, table reservations often back up, and the valet parking attendants work on the run. 

The decor is a splashy interpretation of the Tuscan look with arches, burnished peach walls and striped wooden floors. With all the hard surfaces, the noise level is high. Conversion of the 98-seat restaurant from a former Chinese eating place is said to have cost $1.8 million, including a liquor license."
1993-09-19	Quaint Cottage Mixes Old and Modern	LONG ISLAND has two few restaurants like the tiny Station House Cafe. It is a one-of-a-kind charmer, unlike many new restaurants that have a predictable sameness. This quaint cottage hugging the railroad tracks in Glen Head has had many incarnations in its 74 years, including a real-estate office, home, bar and restaurant. Late last year, Donald Schneckenburger, who previously operated the Right Bank Restaurant in Manhattan, transformed the languishing landmark into a stylish cafe. Outside, the tiny gabled building sports beige stucco trimmed in deep red, flower-filled window boxes and wood signs featuring train motifs.
1993-09-19	The Executive Computer; The Next Tidal Wave? Some Call It 'Social Computing'	PERHAPS without knowing exactly what it will all mean, everyone seems to be talking about the impending convergence of computer networks, groupware, telephone services, handheld electronic devices, cable television, the Internet and other on-line information services, mixed in with the entertainment industry, traditional news media and other communications technologies. Such was the buzz last week in Boston at Forrester Research Inc.'s Technology Forum, where business executives gathered to exchange ideas about what they called social computing. Social computing, a communications-rich brew, is expected to create new ways for businesses and their customers to communicate, over new types of wireless as well as wired pathways, using new types of computers called personal communicators. The rise of social computing is expected to shift the emphasis of computing devices away from simple number crunching and data base management to wider-ranging forms of business communications.
1993-09-14	Ford Unit Buys Card Accounts	The Associates National Bank said today that it would acquire the $222 million credit card portfolio of Great Western Bank, the principal subsidiary of the Great Western Financial Corporation. Associates is an affiliate of the Associates Corporation of North America, a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company.
1993-09-12	"DINING OUT;
Offering the Concept of the 'Barstro'"	"SAM'S is a ""barstro"" -- a combination of bar and bistro -- says Doug Santoro, managing partner of the five-month-old Bergen County restaurant.

 The one-room restaurant, owned by John Gruen of Englewood, qualifies for the first half of that description with a bar along the back of the dining room, separated from the eating area by a glass-and-wood divider. While the dining area lacks the bustle and almost frenetic atmosphere usually associated with a bistro, that may change with time and an evolving clientele."
1993-09-12	For Snacking or More, Day Into Night	IT probably should not be a surprise when a popular hangout like Brett's in Greenwich opens an additional place. Voila! Now we now have Brett's Pasta Cafe in Ridgefield. The formula is similar: A menu of trendy items; pared-back decor of pale yellow walls, natural wood floors, bentwood chairs and glass-top tables; a friendly if offhand service staff and prices moderate enough to attract a youngish crowd.
1993-09-05	A Touch of South Carolina, Home Style	ANYONE nostalgic for the home-style cooking of South Carolina will find reasonable facsimiles at the Meeting Street Grill in Westport. The new restaurant has a name that recalls the center of Charleston's historic district and a menu that combines South and North Carolina specialties with other regional American dishes. Add the skillfully prepared food to the softly lit, romantic decor (champagne-color draperies, lace curtains, comfortable banquettes and chairs, ceiling paintings that evoke skylights) and the friendly, well-trained staff, and the results can be a very memorable dining experience indeed.
1993-09-05	Back to School, So Into the Mall	"After nearly four hours at the Newport Centre Mall, it took Sabrina Williams 20 minutes to convince her two children it was time to leave. ""We bought quite a bit,"" Ms. Williams said, holding out four large J. C. Penney bags."
1993-08-31	The President of Visa U.S.A. Resigns in a Surprise Move	In a surprise move, the president and chief executive of Visa U.S.A., H. Robert Heller, said yesterday that he had resigned from the credit card organization. Mr. Heller, 53, had been widely seen as the successor to Charles T. Russell, the president and chief executive of Visa International, who is 63. Visa U.S.A. is one of the five regional organizations under Visa International, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.
1993-08-29	"DINING OUT;
A Taste of Europe, in Generous Portions"	"IN Italian, Il Gusto D'Europa, the name of Evan Kelish's 15-month-old restaurant in Little Silver, means a taste of Europe, and that is exactly what he offers his customers. The Monmouth County town is near enough to the shore to attract vacationers, but it appears that most of the diners who fill the restaurant to capacity each evening are from the area.

Mr. Kelish was born into a restaurant family and worked in many New Jersey restaurants, including Archer's in Fort Lee and Cafe Meridian in Eatontown. One reason he insists on reservations is that he buys only the meat, fish and produce he can use each day, and he gauges the amount by the number of reservations."
1993-08-29	Cars in Europe	"To the Editor: In discussing European car renting (""Figuring the Cost of Car Rentals in Europe,"" May 9), one cost not mentioned arises when the rental agency insists on a deposit in lieu of a collision damage waiver that is refused. In 1991 we reserved a car through Auto Europe in Camden, Me., using a gold Mastercard, which provides coverage for collision damage. When we picked up the vehicle from Kenning Car and Van Rental in London, using the same card, we declined the C.D.W., whereupon the agency insisted on a deposit of $2,700 to be credited on return of the vehicle."
1993-08-28	These Cards Can Shop Without Using Credit	DO you dislike using a credit card to pay for a simple dinner? Do merchants wrinkle up their noses when you pull out a checkbook? Are you forever making a mad dash to a bank machine to get cash for a purchase? If so, a debit card may provide some relief. The latest versions not only let you debit your checking account at an automated teller machine, but also allow you to make purchases at a number of places. Because these enhanced cards carry Visa or Mastercard logos, some people mistakenly believe they are intended for cash advances or credit when in fact card olders don't borrow at all.
1993-08-26	COMPANY NEWS: Officials See a Whole Lot of ID; Red Faces at Citibank: Cardholders Are Stripped	What started innocently enough last week in Vienna with a Taiwan tourist buying a Rolex watch has cast a shadow on the profitable Taiwan operations of Citibank, the American banking giant, and created diplomatic tension between Taipei and Vienna. Citibank, Taiwan's most profitable foreign bank, expressed regret today over the detention and strip search in Vienna last week of 21 tourists from Taiwan who were mistakenly suspected of holding counterfeit Mastercard credit cards.
1993-08-22	"DINING OUT;
Southwest and Creole Fare, Set to Music"	"CUSTOMERS can come to the Towne Crier for the music or for dinner, but it makes for a pleasant evening to arrive for both. On full-blown concert nights -- featuringperformers like Queen Ida and the Bon Temps Zydeco Band, the Persuasions, Tom Chapin, Leon Redbone, Patty Larkin, Richie Havens, Arlo Guthrie and Magical Mystical Michael (the sometime house magician and a special treat) -- the very real charms of this kitchen are sorely tested. Diners arrive en masse, and the staff is hard pressed to serve everyone before the houselights dim. Occasionally dinners and music overlap, resulting in a bit of good-natured chaos; the show never suffers, but sometimes the feast does.

Southwestern and creole dishes make up the better part of the menu, and a specials list adds about a half-dozen selections for variety. Most of the food cooked up here is unusually inventive, light-years away from the glop dished out at the Tex-Mex chains. The table salsa is not to be missed; full of fire and sweet onions, it goes down easy on scoops of good chips."
1993-08-20	Restaurants	"The conversations were invariably the same. Restaurant Critic: ""We're going to Fourteen."""
1993-08-19	PARENT & CHILD	"A 20-YEAR-OLD woman entered the office of Dr. Paul J. Burgett, a vice president and the university dean of students at the University of Rochester, and requested money from the student-loan fund. When asked why she needed the loan, she finally admitted that she was so far behind in her payments on about 20 credit cards that collection agencies were calling her. Each card was at its credit limit and she was unable to pay even the minimum amounts the creditors demanded. Her solution was to borrow more money. His was to hold what he called ""a funeral."""
1993-08-15	"DINING OUT;
Well-Executed American Contemporary"	"WHAT an unexpected pleasure to find the Wild Orchid Cafe, an interesting and slightly offbeat restaurant, in a shopping mall in Mount Laurel. It was opened a year ago by Glenn Feller, formerly chef at the Rose Tattoo Cafe in Philadelphia, and his wife, Marcie, and already this Burlington County restaurant has become so popular that it is about to expand into larger quarters.

Entering the restaurant, one might be forgiven for thinking that this is a bakery, because there is a large refrigerator case holding cakes, cookies and breads, all baked on the premises and available for takeout. The two rooms behind are the dining rooms, furnished with fabric-covered banquettes, captain's chairs and pretty pink cloth-covered tables with small vases, each one holding a spray of fresh orchids. To complete the theme, pictures of orchids hang on the walls."
1993-08-08	How a Chef Can Make the Difference	FAIRFIELD COUNTY chefs seem to move among restaurants frequently, and few more so than Philip Costas, a talented cook whose sojourns at Old Rialto in Norwalk and at Bella Luna in Greenwich brightened both places considerably. Mr. Costas's followers will be pleased to know that his creativity continues in his own restaurant, Kathleen's, in Stamford. Named for his mother (who makes the restaurant's ravishing desserts), it is to be found in the space vacated by Angsavanee East. The long, two-tier dining room, separated into cozier small areas, has the same brass railings, soft lighting, well-napped tables and stylish look as before. But the walls and accouterments now convey a sense of Americana, with one wall near the entrance suggesting a country cottage. Even the facade, black with bright blue signage and four windowboxes bursting with fresh flowers, generates sophisticated hominess.
1993-08-01	"DINING OUT;
A View for All Seasons on the Hudson"	"WE suspect an unspoken conspiracy of regulars to keep this lovely, secluded spot to themselves has been successful. To our surprise, Windows on the Hudson has occupied this prime location for three years. Of all the little eateries along the Hudson River, Windows is one truly at riverside. The Tappan Zee Bridge looms overhead, the shores of Nyack sparkle and moored craft bob in the adjoining marina. 

The dramatic prospect is this restaurant's serious asset and makes finding the place worthwhile. And with its several indoor and outdoor environments -- none sacrificing the view -- Windows seems to be a restaurant for all seasons. The glass enclosure of the air-conditioned dining room and bar protects diners from summer's dog days, and on blustery winter evenings a fire in the bar's hearth adds coziness. In more temperate weather, the dining room and lounge area move out-of-doors. Under umbrellas on a graveled patio jutting into the river, customers will find a breeze almost guaranteed."
1993-08-01	American Menu With Intriguing Twists	WHEN Randy Nichols, the chef at the West Street Grill in Litchfield, left to start his own restaurant some months ago, it was big news in the area -- such is the fame of the Litchfield establishment. Now that the new place has opened, visitors may be in for a surprise. On his own premises Mr. Nichols has opted for something different. Harvest Roasterie -- no clone of anything nor trying to be smart and fashionable -- is in a former roadhouse on the outskirts of non-trendy Torrington. The owner's stated intention is to serve generous portions of good food at reasonable prices. The goal is modest and, in our experience, already has been achieved.
1993-07-31	Getting a Good Dollar Deal While Abroad	The European currency crisis has created confusion for many Americans who plan to visit Europe soon. With currency exchange rates in flux, many people are seeking ways to get the best possible deal when they convert dollars into European currencies and protect themselves from sharp declines in the dollar while they are overseas.
1993-07-30	Sears Will Begin Accepting Major Credit Cards	"Sears, Roebuck & Company said yesterday that on Sunday its stores would begin accepting Visa, Mastercard and American Express cards for purchases, ending its policy of accepting only its own card or the Discover card. ""It's a win for us and it's a win for our customers,"" Arthur C. Martinez, chairman and chief executive of the Sears merchandising group, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ""It's more convenient for customers, and we also believe it will attract new customers to our stores."""
1993-07-25	An Auspicious Summertime Splash	NICOLE has taken Carol's place. For about 15 years summer visitors trekking to the East End have been greeted by Carol's on Route 27 in Southampton. The restaurant skipped from haute French to down-home chicken and ribs to Spanish tapas and grilled food. But, Carol Rosenwald, the owner, was always center stage. This year, with the switch from Carol's to Nicole's Cafe, Ms. Rosenwald is just the landlord, not the main attraction. The new enterprise is run by Peter Leslie and Rida Medina, who also operate Waiting on You Inc., a company that interviews and hires workers for restaurants in Manhattan.
1993-07-18	"DINING OUT;
A Touch of the Sea at the River's Edge"	"WHEN the streets in town are rolled up for the evening, folks looking for somewhere to go that's a little different head for the river's breezy edge to take in barges, the busy bridge and the sparkling little towns across the river. Here visitors can suit their moods and wallets in spots from the quaint ramshackle to the glass-enclosed and air-conditioned and in food ranging from pizza to lobster. 

One of the best of these unprepossessing little establishments is Dockside. While the river views might be better down the road, few diners will be displeased looking over the masts through the picture windows of the upstairs dining room or at the boats themselves from the sunny outdoor patio.  But Dockside has other advantages: a new kitchen that often succeeds in producing some creative, prettily presented dishes and, on weekends, terrific live entertainment."
1993-07-17	Getting Started When Times Are Rough	"At age 23, Jon Chapman is already deeply in debt, living from paycheck to paycheck and often using his credit card to buy groceries. Still, Mr. Chapman considers himself lucky. Unlike many recent college graduates, he is employed.

""When I graduated in 1992, the jobs were just not out there,"" said Mr. Chapman, now a drama teacher at the Scroggins Elementary School in Houston. ""Every time I start moaning about my financial situation, I decide I should be happy just to have a job."""
1993-07-13	CHEMICAL IS SAID TO BE IN TALKS TO BUY SHELL OIL CARDS	The Chemical Banking Company is in discussions to buy the Shell Oil Company's charge card portfolio, industry sources said. Chemical is seeking to acquire four million accounts from Shell, the sources said. Chemical would convert Shell card holders into Visa or Mastercard holders. The Shell card is used for buying gasoline and other products at the company's service stations.
1993-07-11	The Restaurant Is French. Well, Sort Of.	A GIANT lemon slice hangs outside Citron, an attractive new restaurant on Main Street in Sag Harbor. It is French, but do not expect hearty bistro fare or haute cuisine classics. The stars of the lineup are bright, fresh and new. Lemon pasta, a bowl of fettuccine in a lush, zippy sauce, is Citron at its best. Lemon sparks the decor as well as the menu. At the entrance, a basket of the sunny fruit perfumes the air. Walls are painted a soft lemon-sherbet yellow. A beautiful antique walnut bar, wood floors, a pressed-tin ceiling, Casablanca-style fans and a wall of exposed brick define Citron.
1993-07-09	Restaurants	Mexican food brings to mind rice and beans, corn-scented tortillas, lime and chili peppers. Not mashed potatoes. But Terry Frankenberger, the chef and co-owner of the four-month-old Mission Grill in SoHo, has a vision of perfect California-style Mexican cuisine. He sees potatoes.

1993-07-08	Kroger Plans to Issue Credit Cards to Customers in Texas	The Kroger Company said yesterday that it planned to issue Mastercard credit cards to its customers in Texas, thus becoming the first major grocery chain to team up with a worldwide credit network. Credit cards issued by other companies, like the General Motors Corporation and American Airlines, which offer rebates and discounts, have met with enthusiastic consumer response.
1993-07-07	Make Me an Offer, Mr. Dinkins	Dear Mayor Dinkins, First, I wish you good luck in the coming negotiations to keep the Yankees in New York City. Also, congratulations on your success in preventing Mastercard International from moving to the suburbs. In this era of flight from the city, the presence of such institutions remains a source of pride for all New Yorkers.
1993-07-04	In Ridgefield, Italian Style and Menu	"THE stylish interior of Spagone Ristorante in Ridgefield belies the prosaic sign outside that suggests an ordinary shopping-complex eatery and might turn sophisticated diners away. Spagone's dining space is tiny but Roman arches, Pompeiian red walls accented by cream-color trim, natural oak and framed abstract graphics, spot lighting and black chairs with rush seats, all provide a smart setting for the inviting menu that reflects the current popularity of Italian food. The name Spagone means ""enjoy yourself""; the surroundings make it easy."
1993-07-02	Restaurants	"Le Madri Le Madri has a revolving kitchen door. Since the airy, Tuscan-style restaurant opened four years ago, a succession of three chefs has minded the stoves, but changing hands seems to have little effect on the restaurant's food: it is often pleasing and usually prettier than it tastes. The wood-burning stove in the dining room issues a smoky promise of rustic Tuscany. But the actual food is air-brushed Italian, more Armani than Mama. The cooking style resonates nicely with the crowd faithful to the Seventh Avenue restaurant. At lunch and dinner, Le Madri is a stylish human landscape swathed in the latest fashion, punctuated by high cheekbones and well-sculptured chins. Giggles and a steady chorus of ""ciao"" bounce off the restaurant's vaulted ceiling and vanilla-washed walls. But the noise level is mitigated by generous spacing between the tables, which is rare in Manhattan restaurants."
1993-06-27	"NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Camden, Me.;
From Woolens To Plastic"	"DESPITE a recession and uncertainties about the cost of renovation, the Fore River Company of Portland successfully converted a 150-year-old abandoned woolen mill in this mid-coast town into an upscale business park. 

In late April it sold the 6.5-acre brick and clapboard complex, which has 106,000 square feet of building space, to MBNA America Bank for $3.7 million. MBNA, the nation's third-largest bank credit card lender, with headquarters in Newark, Del., plans to open its New England telemarketing center here in late June and employ up to 400 workers within two years."
1993-06-27	Sampling Seafood in the Norwegian Style	"ONE might think that since Connecticut borders the water, good seafood restaurants would be a dime a dozen. But one of the most frequently asked questions of a restaurant reviewer is ""Where can I get fresh, well-prepared seafood?"" We have a ready answer: Fjord Fisheries in Stamford. The small, appealingly decorated place is in a sports complex just off Interstate 95 at Exit 6. To frequent diners-out, the space might look familiar as the site of several past restaurants, Oslo being the most recent."
1993-06-21	British Air Joins Chase In Card Deal	In a move to strengthen its growing presence in the United States, British Airways has joined with the Chase Manhattan Bank to issue a joint Visa credit card that will earn users frequent-flier miles on international and domestic United States flights. Most major United States airlines have similar affinity cards with banks, for which card owners typically pay an annual fee of $50 and accrue one frequent-flier mile for every dollar charged. This is the first such arrangement between a big American bank and a large foreign airline.
1993-06-20	Style, Substance Make Memorable Meals	THE recent opening in Westport of Restaurant Zanghi -- on the ground floor of an 1873 Italianate building being converted to the Inn at National Hall -- adds a seductively elegant dimension to dining out in what has long been a good restaurant town. The high ceiling, elaborately decorated space has three adjoining dining areas, each with soft green couches and chairs and well-spaced tables with green Art Nouveau-style vases.
1993-06-20	Commercial Property: Looking for the Right Space; Why Mastercard Stayed in Manhattan	AS it turns out, Mastercard International isn't leaving Manhattan after all. Instead, the fast-growing interbank organization, which has been bursting out of its headquarters space at 888 Seventh Avenue, at 53d Street, will spread out across some 350,000 square feet at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, the old Burlington House at 55th Street. New York City gets to keep 450 jobs now and a promise of more than double that number before the decade is out. Mastercard gets as much space as it needs at an excellent price, gets its name on the door of a Class A building in central Manhattan and doesn't have to put any employees through the enervating process of relocating.
1993-06-16	Manhattan Company Is Coaxed Away	Claiming another prize in the regional battle for jobs, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut announced yesterday that the Witco Corporation, a Manhattan-based manufacturer, was moving its headquarters -- and 800 jobs -- to a vacant office building in Greenwich. The state is providing Witco with $8 million in grants. Mr. Weicker took the occasion to defend the state's aggressive economic development campaign and to respond to remarks this week by Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich, who said the states should stop using grants to compete with one another and instead spend the money on schools, roads and bridges.
1993-06-13	Citibank Starts New Flier Plan	Citibank has introduced a program in which its Visa and Mastercard customers can obtain frequent-flier points by charging purchases on their credit cards. It replaces a similar program, operated by an outside concern, called Air Miles, which has been suspended in the United States.
1993-06-13	In Stamford, Before or After the Show	THE Stamford Center for the Arts in downtown Stamford has proved a magnet, with various restaurants opening in the immediate vicinity over a very short period of time. Directly across from the center is Peppino's Ristorante, which is handy for theatergoers who want to dine before or after a performance. In fact, on a performance night recently, the first question the friendly and helpful head waiter asked us was if we were going to the theater. We made the mistake of saying no, and consequently waited and waited for our first course while tables all around us were served briskly. It pays to be in a hurry.
1993-06-11	Mastercard and Midtown: City Hall Wins in New Tack	In a decision that company officials say turned more on New York City's intangible assets than on simple economics, Mastercard International will keep its headquarters in mid-Manhattan rather than move to Westchester County. For the city, Mastercard's decision to move from its current Manhattan headquarters into nine floors of the old Burlington House on the Avenue of the Americas means holding onto 450 jobs, and if Mastercard's own growth projections hold true, getting another 750 within the next 12 years.
1993-06-09	Public & Private; 1-800-UH OH	I am not what you would call a compulsive shopper. I am more of a manic-depressive shopper; first I buy things, then I feel bad about it. My problem has been exacerbated by the meteoric rise of catalogue shopping in America over the last 10 years. During the next 20 minutes, it is not totally beyond the realm of possibility that I could acquire a pair of gardening clogs, a rustic birdhouse, a dog bed filled with cedar shavings or a pair of silk charmeuse lounging pajamas merely by picking up the phone. A confab with the 800 operator for the J. Crew company is much better than hot milk for combating insomnia. The U.P.S. truck pulls up to the house like a loyal dog, big and brown.
1993-06-07	Young & Rubicam Will Try To Brighten the Sears Image	Sears, Roebuck & Company has named the New York office of Young & Rubicam to create advertising campaigns that could prove crucial to the struggling retailer's fate. Sears, the nation's fourth-largest advertiser, ended a five-month review on Friday by choosing Y.& R. New York to direct the apparel account of its huge merchandise group. The agency will be responsible for producing broadcast commercials and print advertisements to sell Sears's brand-name and private-label men's, women's and children's clothing.
1993-06-06	Where Thin-Crusted Pizza Is a Highlight	AT first sight, Al Forno Brick Oven Pizzeria and Ristorante in Old Saybrook looks like a typical pizzeria, with the cooks at work in the rear, pulling and tossing dough and extracting finished pies from the oven with long-handled peels. A waiting line for seats and take-out orders forms at the right side of the room next to a long counter. Alongside the closely spaced tables are auxiliary tables with huge trays of hot pizzas. Even before opening the menu, one is aware of several touches that differentiate Al Forno from the usual no-frills pizzeria: the golden terra cotta tiles on the floor, the malachite green table tops, and the seven panels along one wall painted to resemble windows opening to a tranquil countryside that evokes Italy. On each table is a dish of succulent black and green olives and chunks of focaccia.
1993-06-04	Restaurants	Like a long-running Broadway show, Orso has remained vital and fresh despite many cast changes over the years. This offshoot of the Joe Allen empire opened in 1985 when Restaurant Row on West 46th Street seemed headed toward gastronomic senescence. Almost single-handedly, Orso brought back the Broadway movers and shakers, instilling new life into the block. Orso's step-down main dining room is dominated by a high arching skylight that creates a cheerful, sunny setting at lunch; in the evening it creates a sense of spaciousness. Soft ocher tones and wood trim contribute to a casual, contemporary setting. Walls are covered with publicity photographs of sports and entertainment celebrities. In the back an open tile-and-steel kitchen churns out pizzas, pastas and appealing grilled fare.
1993-05-30	Air Miles Suspended	Air Miles, a year-old program that enabled consumers to accrue frequent-flier points by using certain credit cards or shopping at designated stores, has been suspended in the United States, according to Keith Mills of the Loyalty Management Group in Boston, which operated Air Miles in the United States. Some 2.5 million households were enrolled in the program, said Mr. Mills. Participating companies included Lenscrafters, General Cinema and A.T.&T., as well as local sponsors in Boston, Hartford and Chicago. Tickets, which Mr. Mills said numbered in the hundreds, were issued by American, United, USAir and Air Canada.
1993-05-23	"DINING OUT;
For a Snack or a Feast in Hastings"	"TRANSFORMED from an old, dusty bar called Dorsey's into a bright and spiffy pub of the 80's, Maud's Tavern appropriately offers the fare that evolved in that decade: yuppie food. This popular place, open since February, is done in baize, light woods and brass. Green-glass lampshades, plenty of plants, Windsor-style chairs and too-small tables with plastic placemats and paper napkins set the informal and familiar tone. The photographs of Hastings in olden days and cartoons dotting the walls are worth looking at. We preferred dining in the charming little back room fitted with skylights and a rough-hewn stone wall.

On our visits Maud's quickly filled with neighborhood diners enjoying the opportunity for a bit of hobnobbing and a quick bite. While it doesn't approach the ambiance in quality, the food is not bad, and with its hefty appetizers, full entrees and lighter bar food, the menu can be mixed to please both snackers and feasters."
1993-05-23	A Bistro Overlooking the Saugatuck	THE building on the hillside across the road from the Saugatuck River in Westport that now houses Tonic Bistro has been home to several restaurants in years past. While the white exterior looks much the same, the interior has been given a new paint job and face lift. Institutional yellow bordering on chartreuse walls contrast with dark green tablecloths and black banquettes and chair seats. More cheerful is the airy, glassed-in and covered patio in the rear, with terra cotta walls, red marble-top tables and hanging plants, facing a tiny terrace punctuated by potted pansies. The main dining room has a bistro look, as the restaurant's name would suggest, with modest prices. Our dining experiences indicate there is much to be modest about. We found Tonic Bistro to have two major problems: freshness and preparation. Considering that the proprietor has previous restaurant experience, as owner of Man Ray restaurant in Manhattan, both problems surprised us.
1993-05-17	Optima's Promising Rescue Effort	"With a blue cardigan casually covering his plaid shirt, Frank L. Skillern looks a little out of place sitting at the dark wooden table in a sober private dining room high atop the American Express tower. ""Fridays are dress-down days,"" he said apologetically, explaining that the policy had been instituted by Harvey Golub, who was named chief executive of American Express in February."
1993-05-16	"DINING OUT;
Ethnic Touches in a Peekskill Kitchen"	"EDUCATORS and sociologists wrangling with the thorny issue of multiculturalism might consider consulting Victoria Zeph, who in her kitchen seems to have resolved the problem. Distinctive international touches -- Thai, South American, Ukrainian, Korean, Jamaican, Chinese and Greek as well as French and Italian -- suggest the great waves of earlier and later immigration. But while the feast she prepares is definitely an American one, what delights and surprises are the infinitely varying and vibrant touches of ethnicity this kitchen employs.

The restaurant's setting is as romantically picturesque as ever. The view from the back windows takes in the vine-covered brick shells of long-abandoned factories. Directly below, the hum of a swift-running brook soothes the ear. Inside, where Victoria's brother, Michael, oversees the front of the house, greenery, flowers and unobtrusive music provide a soft backdrop for serious cooking."
1993-05-14	Restaurants	Rosemarie's At first glance Rosemarie's appears to be the snug, subdued little downtown Italian restaurant that is every diner's wistful Grail. Then you sit down. The dining room's tormenting acoustics can make the floor of the New York Stock Exchange seem like the reading room of a men's club. And rather than become acclimated to the din, you find yourself engaging in an escalating war of amplitude with other tables. Eventually some folks finish their meals and go home. Then a few more. Finally, you can talk, if you have a voice left.
1993-05-09	Germanic Fare With a Lighter Touch	FRITZ'S in Woodbury is a rarity in Connecticut, one of a handful of restaurants specializing in German cuisine. In this cholesterol-conscious era of healthful dining, an interest in German food, with its emphasis on heavy meat-potato-and-dumpling dishes, has undergone a decline all over the United States. Yet there's more to German cooking than an abundance of red meat. The Austrian chef and proprietor Gottfried Fritz Halbedl proves this, as the dishes on his German-Continental menu have a light touch and considerable sophistication. The restaurant itself, small as it is, has a similar light look and style. Pale peach walls of slatted wood, brass rails separating a small upper dining area from the lower one, subdued lighting and neatly napped tables with fresh tulips on each, all contribute to the upbeat, handsome decor.
1993-05-02	"DINING OUT;
Inventive Fare for Small or Big Appetites"	"SITUATED in the thick of things, this engaging new place seems to be a meeting point for diners in mid-county, and with good reason. The varied menu offers pizzas, sandwiches, salads and a full range of interesting entrees. In transit or not, come for a snack or a complete dinner; the menu aims to please all appetites. Children will enjoy the food here, too. 

The Rye Grill and Bar inhabits the premises last occupied by the Mug Ale House, but those who knew the former tenant will find few of its traces. What they will discover instead are lofty, light and airy dining areas and an inventive kitchen that has the knack of juxtaposing sweet and bitter, hot and cold, soft and crunchy in many of its dishes, to delicious results."
1993-05-02	Third Indian Spot Joins New Haven Block	DEVOTEES of spicy food know there can never be too many Indian restaurants. While Indian cuisine has been slow to catch on in Connecticut, there are now three Indian restaurants on a single block in New Haven. Gandhi Ji is just over two months old and is ensconced in space previously occupied by an Italian restaurant called Hot Tomatoes. Indian artifacts now adorn pink walls, the tablecloths are lavender, chairs are lacquered black, fresh carnations are on each table, and taped Indian music wafts in the background.
1993-04-30	Restaurants	Luxe Luxe is a very good restaurant with a very bad name. Such an elitist label no doubt scares away a significant number of would-be patrons, leaving them deprived of some arresting cosmopolitan cooking at moderate prices. Luxe, which opened in August on East 21st Street near Park Avenue South, is a spacious, urbane space done in gold tones with blue-green banquettes, votive candles on the tables, an expansive bar up front and soft music. The enterprising chef is Rick Laakkonen, formerly of the River Cafe in Brooklyn and Petrossian in midtown Manhattan. His dishes are delightfully innovative, sometimes startlingly so, yet always well thought-out.
1993-04-29	Mastercard In Electronic Bank Venture	In a move beyond plastic credit cards, Mastercard International said that today it would announce a service that would allow bank customers to pay bills and get financial information by telephone and personal computer. The service, called Master Banking, is a joint venture with the Checkfree Corporation, an electronic funds-transfer company. It would allow Mastercard member banks nationwide, which issue Mastercard credit cards, to offer an expanded version of the Checkfree bill-paying service.
1993-04-25	"DINING OUT;
Where It's Dessert That Stands Out"	"THE Sonoma Grill opened seven months ago in East Rutherford to a great deal of expectation, primarily because the owner is John Foy. Mr. Foy's name was at one time synonymous with good food in New Jersey. As the creator of the Tarragon Tree in Meyersville and Le Delice in Whippany, he received kudos from diners and food writers alike.

But his interests changed, and he became more oriented toward wine. He eventually left the restaurant business and began writing and publishing a newsletter called John Foy's Wine Odyssey."
1993-04-25	Where Asian Cuisine Can Be Sampled	IN a travel-mad age, Asian Experience in Westport offers diners a quick culinary tour of Asia, a chance to sample dishes that might be found in 10 countries. To assure a smooth journey are chefs from Thailand, China (Canton), Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia. It is probably no coincidence that most dishes on the large dinner menu are from those countries and from the Philippines, Indonesia and Korea, with a dish apiece from Singapore and Japan. We have always been skeptical of restaurants that attempt too many different cuisines. But Asian Experience's five specialty chefs should insure that those five cuisines at least would be fittingly presented.
1993-04-18	"DINING OUT;
Engaging Dishes With Bargain Prices"	"AT Thai Continental Cuisine, a cheerful shopping-mall restaurant in Egg Harbor Township, 10 miles west of Atlantic City, the enterprising Thai chef-owner is hedging his bets. On one side of typewritten menu is a list of 27 Thai preparations, and on the other side are a dozen Western dishes ranging from shrimp cappellini to salmon in Champagne sauce. 

Although this part of Atlantic County is developing fast, it is still semirural, and there may not be enough adventurous diners to support an exotic Thai restaurant alone, ergo, the split personality of Thai Continental Cuisine. Also, in addition to assisting at his family's restaurant in Bangkok, the chef, Preecha Songprasit, apprenticed in Philadelphia at a couple of French restaurants, including Les Amis."
1993-04-18	A Sleek Bistro for Downtown Hartford	SOMETIMES in life you meet and make friends with the younger members of a family first and later discover how congenial their parents are as well. That's what happened to us with Max on Main in downtown Hartford. We knew its more robust, country-style offspring, Max A Mia in Avon, but only recently became acquainted with the more sophisticated parent. A sizable storefront space has been transformed into a sleekly casual place that would be right at home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, with a stylish menu that punches all the culinary hot buttons. Styling itself a city bistro, the restaurant has looks that are an understated pleasure: Art Deco-style glass bricks in the entrance and in the main dining area, lacquered pine floors, a color scheme of gray, white and black, black lacquer chairs, well-spaced and smartly napped tables, good but subdued lighting and an open kitchen area in the rear where you can watch the cooks at work. Service is quick, informed and gracious. The printed menu is changed daily, so our recommendations may be gone when you visit.
1993-04-11	Cozy Space, Reliable Menu in New Canaan	BLUEWATER CAFE, a pint-size restaurant in New Canaan, has made a success of consistency and thinking small. It begins with a cozy dining room (space for a mere 26 guests) plus a clutch of seats in the partitioned-off bar area. Tables are close together but white walls, mirrors and vases of fresh tulips create an illusion of space. Small extends to the menu, too. Mostly Italian, it is much the same as when Bluewater opened: a few starters, salads, pasta dishes, grilled and baked entrees and a few daily specials. These too are mostly Italian and have shown flashes of imagination, within the framework of nutritious food extremely well-prepared.
1993-04-06	Officer's Death Sets Back Household International	"Household International Inc. said today that its chairman and chief executive, Donald C. Clark, was delaying his planned retirement after the weekend death of Edwin P. Hoffman, the company's president and chief operating officer.

Mr. Hoffman, 50, was to have succeeded Mr. Clark, 62, as chief executive of the $31 billion financial services holding company, which is one the nation's largest issuers of credit cards. Mr. Clark had planned to announce the move at the company's annual meeting on May 12. Household said that it had begun a search for Mr. Hoffman's successor and that Mr. Clark would run the company in the meantime."
1993-04-04	"DINING OUT;
Gourmet Fare in a Pub on Main Street"	"Formerly known as Speaks, the Hudson Cafe has removed the clutter from the delightful interior of this old-fashioned Main Street pub. The charm, however, remains in lovely architectural details around doors and windows and in the old bar, brick walls and pressed-tin ceiling. But don't expect pub food here. Go elsewhere for chicken wings and zucchini sticks; come here for first-rate dining in a casual space and at bargain prices.

Responsible for the inventive and exceptionally fine food is Patrick Thompson, the chef and co-owner, who employs fresh and organic ingredients wherever possible. (Diners will also find him playing guitar in the trio that entertains on weekends.)"
1993-03-29	Consumers Finally Respond To High Credit Card Interest	"After a decade of self-deception, Americans have finally begun to face the truth about how much interest they actually pay on their credit cards. And now, for the first time, many consumers are shopping for a card that will charge them a lower rate. For years, many consumers were drawn to Mastercards and Visa cards issued by banks mainly on the basis of which one offered the highest credit limit. Studies show that the vast majority of card holders simply told themselves that they did not pay any interest, when two-thirds of them did. Thus they were undisturbed by interest rates that stubbornly remained around 19 percent even as other rates fell sharply. 'More Honest With Themselves' ""People used to say to themselves, 'I may pay interest once in a while, but that's not really me because I'm going to pay it it all off next month,' "" said Ruvan N. Cohen, director of card marketing at Citibank, the nation's largest bank and largest issuer of credit cards. ""In the last year people began to be more honest with themselves. They admit they pay interest and have started to read the rate disclosure boxes. We have to respond to that."""
1993-03-28	"DINING OUT;
A Little Bit of Portugal for Big Appetites"	"JUDGING by the number of Portuguese restaurants that have opened recently and by the fact that they are packed on weekends, Portuguese cuisine seems to be riding high on the new wave of culinary tastes reaching the county, particularly on the western border where most of these restaurants are emerging.  The most recent arrival is Seabreeze, a restaurant specializing in seafood, as its name suggests. This focus is not surprising, as about half of Portugal's border lies on the Atlantic Ocean, and the inhabitants' way with sea fare is an ancient and well-studied craft, one that has relocated admirably to North Tarrytown. And, incidentally, this food is a bargain.

Ordinary soft rolls and a bowl of tasty little black olives began the proceedings, as did a house salad of the usual white and pale green variety. The dressing wanted proper mixing, however, in order to avoid the pockets of pure salt or vinegar that coated some of the greens."
1993-03-28	An Elegant Sushi Bar for New Canaan	PLUM TREE is the first Japanese restaurant to open in New Canaan. And what a restaurant it is! As guests descend a flight of stairs they are greeted with banners of samurai warriors. Upon entering Plum Tree one realizes immediately it is no under-capitalized hole-in-the-wall ethnic eatery. An entryway with mirror, murals and Japanese screens leads into a spacious dining room, made to seem even more so by the beige wall and carpet tones, the natural wood tables, chairs and sushi bar. Along one long wall is a bright-colored mural that resembles a blow-up of a serene, ukiyo-e woodblock scene of Japanese life, with kimonoed ladies taking tea on a wide terrace facing a lake.
1993-03-14	"DINING OUT;
Sampling Mexican Flavors in Yonkers"	"Since its opening almost four years ago, Corridos Mexicanos has enjoyed a reputation rare in these parts: one for serving not only authentic Mexican cuisine but also food that has spark and spontaneity. The atmosphere has its own charm in the suggestion of a whitewashed courtyard decorated with a few dignified touches from Mexican life: bright textiles, figurines, cactus plants. And on weekends -- perhaps the best time to come here -- the exuberant songs of strolling musicians add even more cheer.

On recent visits, we've noted some variations on this old scenario. The menu is shorter, but a specials menu compensates, contributing the culinary variety that regular customers might look for. And dishes ordered on a weekend evening made a splendid meal. Gone from one weeknight performance, however, was that vibrancy that set many dishes apart from workaday Mexican items.  While the food is still passable -- certainly appetizers and desserts are top-notch -- we remember more fresh coriander chopped into the dipping salsa; we remember dipping with both blue and golden nachos; we remember tortillas a tad more tender, and we remember prices lower by $2 or $3.  Agreeable entrees can still be found at the lower end of the price range, but at the high end $21 seems excessive for, say, a piece of slightly dry red snapper topped with flaccid slices of zucchini."
1993-03-14	Simply Stated Italian and French Menu	CIBO, a restaurant in Branford that is a block from the beach, is proof that small -- as in space and menu -- can indeed be beautiful. The restaurant has moved into a building formerly occupied by an Italian restaurant called Serino's (which departed for downtown New Haven and later closed). Robert Johnson, Cibo's owner-chef, was Serino's chef (in both locations), which may be what led him back to Branford. The dining room, which seats 35, makes the most of low-ceiling, limited space: a lacquered wood floor, wide windows with blinds and scalloped maroon valances, and sconces like tiny carriage lamps that cast a soft, romantic light.
1993-03-07	"DINING OUT;
Italian Classics and Some Innovations"	"After closing for quick refurbishment and expansion, Il Mondo reopened its doors about four months ago to reveal attractive dining rooms with comfortably spaced tables, silk bouquets and greenery.  Always a festive note, pin lights frame windows, and the symmetry of neatly tied-back curtains gives the place a touch of formality. 

The kitchen has also received some attention. No longer does butter sauce flood the entrees. Preparations are more even, more controlled."
1993-03-07	"DINING OUT;
Where Soups Are a Kitchen's Strength"	"Keeping up with New Jersey's peripatetic chefs and revolving restaurants is like following a gastronomic version of musical chairs. Take Park One Eleven, which is on Ridgewood's main shopping street across from the town square. 

First it was Sonia Rose. Then the Bergen County storefront, with its rustic, brick-walled interior, became Park One Eleven and was operated by Brooks Nicklas and Wendy Farber. When the music stopped again and that young couple left last fall to open Rosemary and Sage in Riverdale, Peter Loria took their place in the kitchen as chef and co-owner. Mr. Loria had been banquet chef at Highlawn Pavilion in West Orange and, before that, had cooked at the Park Avenue Cafe in Rutherford, which has now become an Italian eating place."
1993-03-07	The Man Who Charged Up Mastercard	"A beautiful couple romps on a sunny beach. ""You know those credit card commercials where they tell you to jaunt off to some exotic paradise,"" says a friendly announcer, Rob Morrow of ""Northern Exposure"" television fame. ""This isn't one of them, O.K.? We're taking our Mastercard to the supermarket."" Suddenly, the camera, perched on a shopping cart, careens through the aisles. The point of all this comes when it gets to the checkout counter. ""It's smart to use your monthly statement to keep track of your monthly grocery spending."" Until this Mastercard campaign, credit cards were sold as passports to glamour, luxury and prestige. American Express, through most of the 1980's, sniffed that ""Membership Has Its Privileges."" Visa combed the world for intriguing locales that didn't accept the Amex card, claiming ""Visa. It's Everywhere You Want to Be."" Even Mastercard centered its previous campaign on people who ""Master the Moment"" through not-quite-so-conspicuous consumption."
1993-03-07	Piquant Dishes, Turquoise and Pink Decor	What once seemed a marathon of new Thai restaurants has slowed to a walk. The latest (and first in more than two years) to open in Fairfield County is Siam Rialto in South Norwalk. Ensconced in a fin de siecle building that was once a theater (the Rialto), the restaurant replaces one named Old Rialto. The decor now combines light tones of Thailand with turquoise walls and turquoise-and-pink tablecloths and napkins. A small turquoise fountain bubbles away in the lower dining area, and a brick wall is hung with Thai art and photos of Thai kings. Upstairs is a balcony with additional tables.
1993-03-06	American Express to Sell Bulk of First Data Stake	The American Express Company said yesterday that it planned to sell more than half its majority stake in the First Data Corporation, the data processing concern that handles transactions for the charge cards of Mastercard and Visa as well as those of American Express. This would be the company's first major transaction under Harvey Golub since he replaced James D. Robinson 3d as chief executive in January. It could raise more than $1 billion for American Express as the company tries to rebound from huge losses. And it could help smooth the bumpy management transition that brought Mr. Golub to power and sent Mr. Robinson to retirement.
1993-03-05	Restaurants	In the final analysis, it could be argued that consistency, more than dazzle, is the touchstone of a good restaurant. Many establishments open with a clear concept and noble intentions, and some even reach their goals. But a restaurant's fiber is really tested a year or two down the line, when early exhilaration evolves into a demanding routine. Andiamo, a jazzy Italian restaurant in a theatrical space near Lincoln Center, has been grappling with that problem for several years. It got off to a high-kicking start in 1988 under a talented and versatile chef, Frank Crispo. As is often the case, just as the restaurant had established an enthusiastic clientele, the chef moved on. Two successors failed to rekindle the excitement, and Andiamo was reduced to a gastronomic understudy in this competitive neighborhood.
1993-02-28	"DINING OUT;
Eating Trattoria Style in White Plains"	"THIS stylish, well-organized trattoria, part of a small New England chain, makes a substantial contribution to White Plains dining. The place draws its name from the Italian photographers of the rich and famous. Their photographs are on the walls along with posters with Italian titles for films like ""The Graduate,"" ""Giant"" and ""Gone With the Wind.""

Configured in such a way that it escapes being cavernous, the dining room seats well over 200 diners in various areas, including a charming cafe on the walkway of the sheltered concourse hooking from North Broadway to the plaza adjoining Sears on Main Street. In good weather, an outdoor cafe in front will be in operation."
1993-02-28	200-Year-Old Tavern Offers Improved Menu	SILVERMINE TAVERN in Norwalk is so much an institution -- it's been around for more than 200 years -- that it's easy to overlook, especially given the number of new restaurants that have opened in recent years. Though it has long been easy to dismiss the tavern for fine dining, its marvelous atmosphere -- the uneven brick floors, walls hung with 18th- and 19th-century folk art and native paintings, fireplaces, various cozy dining areas -- make it a great place to bring visitors for cocktails. Warm weather has always been especially inviting, when guests could sit on the deck and watch the swans and waterfall below. And now the food at Silvermine Tavern has improved. Recent visits have confirmed that rumored changes in the kitchen have all been to the good.
1993-02-26	Restaurants	"Given the numbing sameness of so many new restaurants in New York City -- cookie-cutter Italian trattorias, predictable French bistros and how-much-can-you-eat homey American dining rooms -- it is exhilarating to see a venture as original as Vong, the new Thai-inspired restaurant on Third Avenue at 54th Street. Before going there, however, it's best to put aside your notions of New York Thai food. Vong is to Manhattan's mom-and-pop Thai restaurants what the Carnival cruises are to the Circle Line. Big, bold and stagy, Vong holds no claims to culinary verisimilitude. When was the last time you saw foie gras with mangoes in an Eighth Avenue Thai dining room? ""It's my interpretation of French and Thai,"" says Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the chef and owner, whose varied background includes two years of cooking in Bangkok. Given his track record -- four stars at Lafayette and three stars at the mobbed Jo Jo -- no wonder Vong is the hottest ticket in town."
1993-02-25	BUSINESS DIGEST	The Economy The sharp decline in long-term interest rates has prompted corporations, homeowners, states and municipalities to refinance debt, which will save money and help the economy. [ Page A1. ] Congress is expected to approve an economic stimulus by early April. But tax increases and spending cuts will not be voted on conclusively until this summer at the earliest. [ A16. ]
1993-02-25	Mastercard tries to change its image in a campaign by Ammirati.	"SHHHHH. Quiet, please. Dr. Ammirati and Dr. Puris, with a consultation from Dr. Fleischman of ""Northern Exposure,"" are about to attempt a most risky surgical procedure, an advertiser imagectomy. The patient is Mastercard International, which came to Ammirati & Puris in August to seek treatment for serious symptoms developed during the five years it was cared for by Lintas New York. The Mastercard identity had grown sluggish, particularly compared with vibrant images enjoyed by rivals in the intensely competitive credit card market like Visa International and Discover."
1993-02-21	"DINING OUT;
Cajun Food, and It's on the Spicy Side"	"WITH Mardi Gras coming up this week, a visit to an eating place like Michael's Back Street Cafe, with its zesty interpretations of Cajun and soul fare and piped-in jazz music, is a way to catch the carnival spirit.

Opened by Michael and Adrienne Brown four years ago, this funky little Essex County hideaway is in a converted luncheonette down a driveway with off-street parking. Lace curtains on the storefront windows, languid ceiling fans and votive candles lend atmosphere to the dimly lighted, no-frills spot."
1993-02-21	"DINING OUT;
A Cozy Hideaway With a River View"	HOMEY window swags, stained glass, ceramic figures and wreaths are among the little decorative touches that soften the look of this tiny, wood-panel dining room. Strings of lights around the windows echo those tracing the span of the Tappan Zee Bridge in the distance, the focus of this restaurant. A fence across the road does little to detract from the view.  On a recent stormy night a fire in the corner hearth warmed our backs. Ceiling fixtures spotlighted the many delightful preparations that issued from the kitchen. All things considered, the place is a cozy, romantic little hideaway where guests can dine informally but well. The menu is short, appropriate for the small seating capacity of this dining spot.
1993-02-21	Convivial Space, Straightforward Menu	ITALIAN restaurants continue to proliferate. A recent arrival in Stamford is Mona Lisa, which has turned a plain storefront into a noisy, happy space. One exposed brick wall has bricked-in Roman arches; the opposite white wall sports a bevy of framed photographs of the owner with various celebrities.
1993-02-14	"DINING OUT;
Traditional Japanese Fare in White Plains"	"THE tiny space at Fujinoya has recently been reorganized. But for two token chairs, the sushi bar has contracted to make room for a few more tables, small but adequate. The charming clutter remains, however, and under a mobile of paper cranes, and flanked by a collection of fans, framed prints, figurines and knickknacks, diners can enjoy selections from a menu of more than six dozen dishes, most of them based on sparkling fresh seafood. 

The menu consists of an album of photographs with English explanations of the displayed offerings, a presentation that makes ordering easy.  Particularly attractive are the generous number of small dishes on hand; diners can easily make a meal of four or five of them."
1993-02-14	Old-Fashioned Diner, New Style Dishes	BISTRO 55 in Fairfield, a new project of the owners of Cafe de la Plage in Westport, is a landmark diner now attached to a large frame building. The diner retains its old-fashioned white tile floor, long counter and window booths in front. The main dining area (seating 24) is a carpeted, rather dimly lighted interior room with three booths, a few wood tables, black lacquered chairs, a pressed-tin ceiling and lemon and rust painted walls hung with paintings, prints and old photographs of Fairfield. Upstairs, an old-fashioned bar, with a huge stuffed marlin on one wall, has additional tables for dining. The menu contains standbys like clams casino and scampi as well as certain new American concepts, some of which work, others not always with consistency. For instance, a starter of smoked ham and corn fritters in a mango vinaigrette sounded intriguing, but the reality lacked ham and the pool of sauce the fritters rested in tasted more like undiluted orange juice than mango. Despite the absence of smoked ham, the fritters were crisp, golden and tasty -- certainly among the best of the appetizers sampled. The plate also yielded a sharp, fresh-tasting chopped tomato-fennel sauce laced with raspberry vinaigrette. The sauce later surfaced as a garnish for chicken paillard.
1993-02-12	Ford and Citibank Issue Card	Moving to counter the General Motors Corporation's entry into the credit-card business, the Ford Motor Company and Citibank introduced a rival program yesterday. Under terms of the Ford Citibank Visa and Mastercard program, card holders would earn rebates on new Ford, Lincoln or Mercury vehicles equal to 5 percent of their total annual purchases, as much as $700 a year and accumulating for up to five years. That's a faster rebate program than offered by the G.M. card, which allows $500 in rebates a year for up to seven years.
1993-02-10	Mastercard Adopts 'Smart Money' Label	"The new advertising campaign for Mastercard International, due Feb. 28 from its new agency, Ammirati & Puris in New York, will replace the long-running theme ""Master the moment"" with this slogan: ""Mastercard. It's more than a credit card. It's smart money."""
1993-02-07	"Dining Out;
Selections From the Sea, Portuguese Style"	"Lisboa a Noite is a find. Open since last July, the restaurant has already attracted an enthusiastic cadre of neighborhood diners. And with a little more polish in the kitchen and prompt service, Lisboa will be attractive to a wider clientele.

The place even now has a great deal going for it. The unusual and charming decor includes an antique suit of armor standing guard at the entrance, a polished floor reflecting candlelight, greenery softening the corners and old, carved serving stations here and there. Taped music wafts through the room, and a guitarist strums on weekends.  Portions are generous, some of the prices are a bargain, and the food can be sensational."
1993-02-05	Enhanced Mastercard Introduced by G.M.	The General Motors Corporation, basking in the budding popularity of its five-month-old credit card, introduced a gold G.M. Mastercard for more affluent customers. Unlike G.M.'s original Mastercard, which offered relatively small lines of credit with no annual fee, the enhanced version will cost $39 annually and offer a credit line of up to $25,000. Customers of the gold card can earn a rebate equal to 5 percent of their outlays toward the purchase of a G.M. car, to a limit of $7,000 at the end of seven years.
1993-02-05	BUSINESS DIGEST	The Economy The productivity of American workers shot up by 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Along with big gains in January retail sales and record-breaking activity on the stock market, the data suggest that a full-fledged recovery might be under way. [ Page D1. ] The Dow surged 42.95 points, to a record close of 3,416.74. Most other market averages reached new highs and Big Board volume was the seventh highest in history. [ D1. ]
1993-02-05	Restaurants	Brasserie Pascal Brasseries are made for midwinter days, especially those when the wind makes a wool coat feel as porous as a screen door and when it seems that nothing short of a hearty meal and a glass of red wine could thaw your bone marrow.
1993-02-05	Strong January Sales Signal Good Quarter for Retailers	Retail sales roared ahead at a surprising pace in January, with almost every major store chain posting eye-popping gains. What's more, because most merchants managed their inventory so carefully during the holiday season, they were not just getting rid of clearance merchandise last month, a trend that bodes well for their first-quarter profitability.
1993-01-24	"DINING OUT;
The Cuisine Is Bright and Contemporary"	"IT'S in an out-of-the-way Morris County spot north of Wayne, and the little white building beside the road doesn't look like much. Only a pretty sign with the restaurant's new name, Rosemary and Sage, hints that there's more here than meets the eye. 

Still, who would expect to find such cosmopolitan dishes as an appetizer of satiny slices of duck carpaccio fanned around slivers of balsamic-scented pear and accompanied by crisp Cheddar wafers? Or an entree of grilled salmon with orange vinaigrette and peppercorn-flecked pasta, followed by the likes of cranberry bread pudding with apricot creme anglaise? Diners who have followed the culinary trail of Brooks Nicklas and his wife, Wendy Farber, would, that's who."
1993-01-24	Riding the Crest of an Italian Food Wave	WITHIN the last 16 years, a trim little frame house set back from U.S. 1, where Stamford melts into Old Greenwich, has been host to at least three restaurants. Now a fourth has taken possession. Ciaobella! (Hello, Beautiful!) is an elegant looking restaurant riding the crest of the Italian food craze. To the right of the foyer, down a few steps, is a large nonsmoking dining room with walls of pale and dark green ornamented with sleek art, a formal fireplace at the far end, well-spaced tables with stylish chairs and a ficus tree gracing the room's center. A smaller room for diners who smoke, to the left off the foyer and also down several steps, is equally inviting, with its own gas-lit fireplace.
1993-01-18	Qiaotou Journal; Chinese Bet Their Shirts on Buttons and, Bingo!	For a glimpse into China's economic revolution, it is useful to stroll down the main street of this humble little town on the banks of a putrid river in the middle of nowhere. Peasants amble along the dusty pavement, carrying protesting chickens over their shoulders, as rickshaws squeeze by street stalls pressing in on both sides with mounds of bric-a-brac. Yet this remote speck in southeastern China has propelled itself over the last dozen years into the button capital of the world.
1993-01-17	"DINING OUT;
Traditional Indian Cuisine in New Decor"	"The look is brighter at Bengal Tiger these days, the restaurant's fresh sparkle properly matching the many splendid dishes that come forth from this kitchen. Fresh paint, pictures, dramatic carvings -- all newly illuminated under brilliant canopies -- line the walls of the elegant tunnel of a dining room. 

At one end, a glass wall separates diners from the workings at the tandoor, the vertical, cylindrical clay oven that holds long skewers of meats. The delicious elastic bread called nan, one of the best breads here, is also baked in this oven. The patties of dough are slapped onto the tandoor's hot walls and baked until soft and steamy."
1993-01-17	A Rare Oasis of Enjoyment Suffers a Moment of Doubt	"HANGING upside down with her appendages wedged between giant black rubber bands, Astrid Hulse of Wading River called to her son. ""I don't think I'm going to make it to the top, Chet,"" she said. Although parents hate to disappoint their children, there is only so much a 40-year-old mother can do when trapped like a bug in an 18-foot-high web of squiggly rubber. ""We had fun anyway,"" Mrs. Hulse said as she and her son Chestin Henry, 19, exited the Mini-Web, an attraction at the Space Plex Amusement Park in Nesconset."
1993-01-10	A Tiny Chinese Place for New Canaan	NEW CANAAN, which for decades had not a single Chinese restaurant, now has three. The newest is Hunan Taste, which is in a sliver of storefront space that once was part of the Deli-Bake delicatessen next door. The seating in Hunan Taste's narrow space is for 20 at most, with three tables for 4 and four tables for 2. Despite the close quarters, the tiny dining area is neat and cheerful, with good lighting and walls lined with Chinese art works. A waiter dances attendance every time your tea cup is empty. It is somewhat paradoxical that Hunan Taste seems best set up for take-out, yet its eat-in food is infinitely better, perhaps because it comes piping hot right from the kitchen and items that should be crisp arrive as intended.
1993-01-07	Nationsbank Card Features a Savings Plan	Nationsbank Inc., the country's No. 4 bank, said today that it was introducing a credit card that would enable card holders to build their savings when they make purchases. The card program, a joint venture with Start Inc. of Herndon, Va., will provide each holder of a Nationsbank-Start Visa or Mastercard with a tax-deferred annuity administered by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of New York.
1993-01-03	When Exotic Really Is the Right Word	ETHIOPIAN fare is exotic enough but Caffe Adulis in New Haven takes unusual ethnic dining one step farther in offering Eritrean fare as well. Eritrea is part of Ethiopia (on the northeast coast, bordering the Red Sea), and the restaurant is named for an Eritrean port city. Although the restaurant is barely three months old, its popularity was already evident on recent visits there. Caffe Adulis is no hole-in-the-wall, undercapitalized kind of place. Situated diagonally across from the Shubert in downtown New Haven, it has converted a storefront location into an airy, bright, spotless two-level dining space, divided into smoking and nonsmoking sections.
1992-12-27	With the Holiday, More Debt Woes	"THE good news is that consumer spending on Long Island rose for the fifth month in a row, thanks to brisk holiday sales and a rise in consumer confidence. The bad news is that much of the seasonal spree was financed on plastic. 

A result: Thousands of overzealous holiday spenders will usher in the new year with painful debt hangovers."
1992-12-13	Where the Menu Crisscrosses the Map	WHEN the restaurant called Gates first opened its wrought-iron doors in New Canaan in 1979, you could count the restaurants in town on one hand with fingers to spare. Gates became an instant hit, based on a combination of appealing dishes, inviting atmosphere and friendly staff. Today one block of Forest Street and the parallel block on Main Street constitute practically a restaurant row. In light of all the competition, we decided to see how Gates was holding up. On the basis of business on a weekday, weeknight and weekend, it seems evident that Gates continues to do well. Its attached bar (with dining tables) is very much a gathering place. Atmosphere has much to do with a restaurant's success, and in this Gates has exercised a masterly touch. A spacious room, separated into smaller areas by the use of huge terra cotta urns filled with ivy, uses colorful paintings and ceramic plates on cream-colored walls, apple-green checked cloths on glass-topped tables and large white globe lights overhead to provide visual appeal. Two large ficus trees and a skylight over the high ceilinged end of the room add airiness.
1992-12-11	American Express: Substance Over Style?	They couldn't be more different: James D. Robinson 3d, the patrician, Harvard-educated son of a leading Atlanta banking executive who spent a lifetime honing his manners, his image and his physique, and Harvey Golub, the bearish, chain-smoking son of a struggling small-business owner who once flunked out of college but parlayed street smarts, moxie and hands-on dexterity into a career as a corporate repairman, always on call. If Mr. Robinson is the master of the mansion, the sleek personification of American Express, Mr. Golub is the plumber he frantically dials when all the pipes burst in subzero weather at 3 A.M. But now that a once-docile board has decided to usher Mr. Robinson out as chairman and chief executive of the American Express Company, with the stock price and earnings depressed, Mr. Golub, the company's president of 16 months, is the leading candidate to take over the whole estate. The apparent favorite of Mr. Robinson, who is at least nominally leading the search, Mr. Golub has also won the allegiance of Wall Street. Some analysts there are prodding the board to crown him right away instead of implying, by a prolonged search, that Mr. Golub is not quite good enough.
1992-12-11	California Retailer Settles Suit on Customer Privacy	Shoppers at Mervyn's department stores in California may be eligible for nearly $6 million worth of vouchers because of a settlement of a lawsuit that contended that the retailer had violated a privacy statute. Under the proposed settlement, announced on Wednesday, Mervyn's has agreed to pay $6 million to its customers who used Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover credit cards between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 of last year. Mervyn's officials estimated five million transactions had been made with the cards during that period.
1992-12-06	"DINING OUT;
Innovative Food and High Standards"	"JUST before the bridge that crosses the Delaware River from Frenchtown into Pennsylvania, there is an old building on the right called the Frenchtown Inn. Seven years ago, Bob and Holly Long bought the inn and turned it into a mecca for people who enjoy innovative cooking.

At that time, there was a dearth of good restaurants in Hunterdon County. Food lovers flocked to this casual country inn."
1992-12-06	"DINING OUT;
Informal and Cheery Oasis in Mahopac"	"HUNGRY folks weary from walking the shopping plazas and malls of busy Route 6 will find in the area few choices for nourishment other than the usual fast-food spots. Diners who want a little more in the way of ambience, comfort and food will want to remember Marco's. Sandwiched between Routes 6 and 6N in the middle of Mahopac, this little neighborhood restaurant offers a dinner menu that will please most comers. 

It is easy to miss this stark, unprepossessing cinder-block building and its entrance, which hugs Route 6. Once inside, however, diners will find the welcome warm and the dining room an informal and cheery oasis for hearty appetites or tired feet."
1992-12-06	American Express Begins Search to Replace Chief	The American Express Company said yesterday that it had begun to seek a replacement for James D. Robinson 3d, its chairman and chief executive for 15 years. Mr. Robinson is participating in the search for his replacement and will step down when a successor is chosen, perhaps as soon as next year.
1992-12-06	Satisfying a Craving for Sushi or Sashimi	CONSIDERING the proliferation of Japanese restaurants in New York City over the last 20 years, it is surprising that there are still so few Japanese restaurants in Connecticut. The number in the state has held fairly constant for years. Thus when a new one appears, fans of Japanese cuisine (and as one-time brief residents of Japan we are among them) are quick to pay a visit. Mannen, just off Route 35 in Ridgefield, is tucked into a small shopping complex in a free-standing building previously occupied by an Italian restaurant. A clue to finding Mannen (its name means 10,000 years, the ultimate) is the large white globe lantern glowing in the entrance window. The interior decor has echoes of the previous occupant, with dark wainscoting, a long brick wall and wooden booths opposite, and a cast-iron stove in the rear. An attempt has been made to establish a new identity, with oversize gilded paper fans on the walls. Admirers of sushi and sashimi will be pleased to find both specialties on the menu. But it is disappointing to discover that there is no sushi bar. This means that the pleasure of inspecting the various fish available and watching the sushi chef at work is missing. It requires a giant leap of faith to order raw fish unseen. We took the plunge anyhow, with a deluxe sushi. Although the price was reasonable, the selection was mundane for such a label. There were nine pieces of norimaki-zushi and six nigiri-zushi, or hand rolls, all served on a traditional wooden platter. Included were maguro (tuna), ebi (shrimp), ikura (salmon roe) and flying fish roe. Missing were uni (sea urchin), mirugai (giant clam), anago (sea eel), tako (octopus) or ika (squid), which make a deluxe assortment special. Despite the lack of a visible sushi bar, the individual pieces tasted fresh, and a generous amount of wasabe and gare (pickled ginger slices) accompanied the platter. Mannen offers a sizable number of appetizers, which were among the menu highpoints. Tako su (sliced octopus in a light vinegar dressing) was tender and flavorful as was hijiki (cooked seaweed). Age tofu (deep-fried tofu) was another success; the fresh bean curd square was light and supple, the batter sheer and minimal, and the shavings of katsuobushi (dried bonito) atop added a briny flavor. Yakitori (broiled pieces of chicken breast on tiny skewers) was piping hot, tender and well-seasoned. Nasushigi (fried eggplant with sweet miso sauce) might have frightened off the unitiated, it was so lacking in the usual elegant Japanese style of presentation. It was a large, unrecognizable slab covered with a brownish sludge that oozed like a swamp thing over the plate. Despite its looks, the eggplant with its slathering of miso and sprinkle of sesame seeds on top was surprisingly tasty. Among the entrees, the most intriguing choice was shoga yaki, consisting of several fingers of chicken or pork in a mild ginger sauce. Beef negimaki was also competently prepared: slices of tender beef wrapped around scallions, which provided a sharp taste and textural contrast. Our biggest disappointment was shrimp tempura (all-vegetable or a vegetable-shrimp mixture were also options). The portion was generous but the flabby, doughy batter surrounding each shrimp bore no resemblance to a traditional wispy, crispy tempura batter, and the tempura sauce lacked the zap of grated ginger. Desserts are limited. Green tea ice cream was bland but refreshing, while the ginger ice cream needed more of a ginger snap. An unusual dish called kan-ten was described as seaweed jello with apple juice. It was an apple-flavor mixture with the consistency of soupy applesauce, decidedly an acquired taste. Dinner for two -- three courses each -- was $33 before tax, tip and drinks. There is a full bar, and two brands of Japanese beer (as well as other beers) are available. Mannen Satisfactory 11 Danbury Road (Girolmetti Court, Route 35), Ridgefield. 438-8727.

1992-11-29	"DINING OUT;
Italian, Manhattan Style, in Mount Kisco"	"DINERS yearning for the hustle, bustle and cozy seating arrangements of Manhattan eateries will certainly be satisfied with the pace and closeness in this sleek, stylish, informal trattoria. Tables are crowded into the small space left by the open kitchen (with its wood-burning oven), which, with the tiny two- or three-stool bar (really a service counter), occupies fully half the room. Serving staff and folks waiting for takeout orders occupy any remaining inches. Everything is in full view, and most things perform the function of being decorative while being stored: a stuffed rooster casts a glassy eye over the cheery jumble of ropes of peppers and garlic, crates of eggs, baskets of breadsticks, bottles and cases of wine, quarts of olive oil, trays of desserts and chefs cooking madly.

An animated clientele seems to enjoy the closeness and the informality, which, to be sure, discourages intimate conversation but instead allows diners to participate in the discussions of absolute strangers. Most of our accidental neighbors have been delightful, but this kind of camaraderie will probably not please everyone."
1992-11-29	"DINING OUT;
Homey, Inventive Food at a Lively Bistro"	"AS rewarding as it is to discover new restaurants, it's just as satisfying to find that an established place that has kept its edge. Ruga, a casually smart American bistro at the western edge of Bergen County, still has the convivial buzz of success and, judging from a couple of recent visits, has even improved since it was reviewed four years ago. 

Both the homey yet inventive food and alert, good-natured service at this Oakland restaurant are watched over by Charles Nuzzo and Terry Earl, the co-owners. There's one trait here, however, that could do with a change: the main courses, while generously portioned and often good, are still not up to the level of the enticing appetizers and desserts."
1992-11-24	American Express Sets A 1-2 Punch	ONLY a month after unexpectedly turning its agency lineup upside-down, the American Express Company is aggressively intensifying advertising for its charge cards as its agency, Ogilvy & Mather New York, delivers to consumers and retailers a sharply competitive one-two punch. One punch comes from the first major endorsement by the comedian Jerry Seinfeld, star of the eponymous sitcom on NBC. In commercials that began running Saturday in seven large markets, including Los Angeles and New York, Mr. Seinfeld, in his characteristic edgy persona as a commentator on life's irksome annoyances, mocks rival credit cards, like Visa, issued by banks.
1992-11-22	Brightening the Season With Adobe Style	"SAGEBRUSH CAFE in Georgetown has such sunny, Southwestern decor -- desert pink and turquoise walls, matching bentwood chairs, clever murals stretching over the entire long wall in three dining areas -- that after a few minutes there, a guest almost involuntarily starts dropping g's and drawling ""Howdy, pardner."" The cafe occupies space that formerly featured another type ethnic restaurant, the Indian Kismet. Ample space has been sectioned into three comfortable dining areas, and a small bar called Tequila Sheila's, which is cheerfully wholesome despite its desperado-like name. The murals bear such titles as the Jackalope Stampede, Mojave Mirage and Renowned Red Rocks and cover entire walls."
1992-11-15	"DINING OUT;
Tantalizing Hong Kong-Style Cantonese"	"THANKS to the influx of Hong Kong-style restaurants in northern New Jersey, lovers of Cantonese food no longer have to trek into Chinatown for platters of steamed seafood plucked fresh from fish tanks and for subtly seasoned casseroles.

A recent addition to the Bergen County scene is Sing Ya, which opened six months ago in the former Ming Palace location in Englewood Cliffs.  Operated by Tommy Young, whose family also owns Jade Ho in Denville, this bright, sprawling restaurant is decorated in cool tones of jade green with a few Oriental touches. Some tables are in a narrow, airy greenhouse addition overlooking the parking lot. By the entrance, a pocket-sized Oriental rock garden is accented with craggy boulders imported from China at a cost, Mr. Young said, of $10,000."
1992-11-15	New American Cuisine Plus 40's Tunes	BAGDON'S site in New Haven has seen four successive restaurants (three of them very good) over the last dozen years. One hopes that this, the latest, survives. For style, quality and culinary skills it certainly deserves to stay and thrive. Bagdon's (named for the owner, Jon Bagdon), a high-ceilinged, ground-floor space in a brick corner building, has been transformed into a stylish place to dine. White brick walls, unobtrusive gray carpeting, black chairs, white-napped tables (luxuriously spaced) and indirect wall lighting create a handsome atmosphere enhanced by background tapes of pop favorites of the 1940's. The short menu offers several popular dishes of New American cooking, adding to the restaurant's style. As is often the case, the appetizers are among the most enticing items on the menu. A major hit was oysters with champagne sauce: five plump oysters in a luscious champagne-edged cream sauce augmented by a julienne of carrots and leeks.
1992-11-13	BUSINESS DIGEST	The Economy Bank lending to businesses has edged upward at a 1 percent annual rate in the last two months after a two-year decline. Bankers say that loan demand, though still anemic, is improving, and corporate borrowers say banks are more eager to lend.

1992-11-13	Sears to Test Use of Other Credit Cards	"Giving a long overdue nod to nearly four decades of consumer finance, Sears, Roebuck & Company said yesterday that it would begin accepting Visa, Mastercard and American Express credit cards in 140 stores in six markets on a test basis. ""In today's competitive credit climate, we need to be as responsive and accommodating to our customers as possible,"" said Peter Fisher, executive vice president at Sears Credit. A Break With Tradition The test is tantamount to heresy at the nation's third-largest retailer, which introduced store credit to America in 1911 when it offered installment payment plans to farmers who could not obtain bank loans to pay for big-ticket items in its catalogues. That payment system evolved into a revolving charge account program in 1953."
1992-11-11	Help a Mail-Order Company: Send Food	"AT a recent conference of people who sell things by mail, there was much moaning and groaning among those who sell food. ""There hasn't been real growth,"" said William Dean, who is a consultant in the catalogue industry. Mr. Dean, who with Hannah Bruce publishes the Bruce Report, a catalogue trade journal, says the industry has no one but itself to blame, because it hasn't been responsive to consumer demands. ""People are much more price-value oriented,"" he said, ""and in all segments of mail order -- clothes, equipment -- there is a very definite move downward toward more moderate prices. But not in food. I haven't seen any reaction from them and they need to look at their margins."""
1992-11-08	"DINING OUT;
On This Menu, Variety Is the Spice"	"ABOUT two miles West of exit 8A on the New Jersey Turnpike is a two-year-old Middlesex County restaurant called Lark's Cafe. The restaurant, which is named for the 10-year-old daughter of the chef and owner, Stanley Sudol, is a simply decorated storefront offering unusual dishes at reasonable prices.

It would be difficult to find an eating place with a wider range of types of food. Where, for instance, would one go for an African-inspired dish called piri piri (shrimp with African spices served with basmati rice), or escargots with pasta, or chicken soup with matzoh balls? Three different restaurants, probably, unless one knew about Lark's, where all these dishes, and more, are available.  Mr. Sudol, who was executive chef at Blake's and Huxley's, two restaurants in Rockefeller Center, is interested in exploring dishes from various cultures. His next menu will also feature some dishes low in sodium and fat, which will be marked as such."
1992-11-06	Judge Rules Against Visa In Sears Suit	Sears, Roebuck & Company won a battle yesterday in its efforts to expand its credit card business by issuing Visa cards, when a Federal court jury in Salt Lake City ruled that Visa U.S.A. was violating antitrust laws by excluding Sears. The lawsuit charging antitrust violations was filed by Dean Witter Financial Services, a unit of Sears that issues the Discover Card but wants to issue Visa cards as well.
1992-11-01	A Country Inn's Restaurant in Revival	FANS of the Inn at Chester will be happy to learn that it has reopened, under new ownership, with a revival of its restaurant as well. This time around, the restaurant has a new name, The Post and Beam, which aptly describes the room's interior construction. Much is the same as before: the weathered barn atmosphere with a 20-foot ceiling and a vast stone fireplace at one end (stacked with birch logs), a balcony at the other, and a narrow glass-enclosed greenhouse along the exterior wall. Light from a handsome Colonial-style pewter chandelier and wall sconces add a romantic aura to the room. Simple white Syracuse china and fresh flowers on each table project both simplicity and elegance. If the dining room conveys a sense of antiquity, the menu decidedly does not. This is no old-fashioned New England inn menu; there's not a cut-glass dish of cottage cheese, corn relish or Indian pudding in sight. It is a menu of the 1990's in spirit, in its use of fresh ingredients and food combinations. The current menu breathes the winds of autumn, with several fall vegetables (butternut squash, sweet potatoes and the like) and game and red meat dishes.
1992-11-01	Selecting Specials From the TV Screen	TUTTO PAZZO is enlivening the Huntington Harbor area. No, this new spot in Halesite is not part of the burgeoning bar scene that has made Huntington Village a late-night mecca for the Island's youth. Rather, it is a snappy, bright, casual pasta cafe with multigenerational appeal. There is action in the bar, but it centers on devouring complimentary hors d'oeuvres and viewing the antipasto and dessert gustatory floor show displayed nearby.
1992-10-31	It Pays to Stick to Basics in Credit Cards	With competition rising in the credit card business and more enticements being offered almost every week, consumers should weigh carefully whether the cards they now have are serving their needs at the lowest cost. A switch might save them money. But it is no easy task tracking all the wrinkles of some cards. The GE Capital Corporation's Mastercard, introduced in September, offers discount coupons and rebates from 24 companies, including Kmart, Macy's and Northwest Airlines. To profit from these deals, consumers must use them to offset the higher costs of the card itself -- a $25 annual fee and an interest rate set at 12.4 percentage points above the prime rate, for a current total of 18.4 percent.
1992-10-25	"DINING OUT;
Town of Many Charms Gets a New One"	"AMONG Lambertville's many charms are its antiques shops and restaurants, which are often tucked away on the little side streets of this delightful Hunterdon County town. This year has been busy for local restaurants; two closed, three opened and one moved.  One of the newest, just four months old, goes by the heady name La Dolce Vita -- the sweet life.

It is a new venture for the owner, James Babey, a real-estate developer. But he brought in experts to help him. Robert Edmondson, the chef, used to be at La Padella in Philadelphia, and the general manager, Jerry Kovac, came from La Cucina in Somerville."
1992-10-25	French Fare in a Little White Farmhouse	"A LITTLE white clapboard farmhouse with front porch, roosting quietly on a tree-sheltered hilltop: What better place to open a good, caring restaurant? That seems to have been the guiding principle that led at least three restaurateurs to the shaded hills along Route 202 north of New Milford. The third and latest to occupy the modest but appealing site is Le Marmiton with an attractive sign reading ""Cuisine Francaise."" Up the steps, along the homey front porch, into the two tiny dining rooms, the configuration looks much the same as during its previous tenancy as Carol Peck's. There have been changes in decor, however."
1992-10-18	"DINING OUT;
Traditional Italian Cuisine in Armonk"	"Onda Blu, open just two years, fills its niche tidily. Here diners can partake of traditional Italian cuisine served in a serene, low-key space done in cool, contemporary colors, a pleasant change from fake brick and mock oil paintings.

Although some features of this restaurant are to be admired, some of our earlier old complaints still hold. The menu is overly long, heavy with the predictable offerings of most Italian restaurants.  In addition, it could be more informative. We suspect that, like us, most diners would appreciate written descriptions of the kitchen's special efforts -- dishes called alla Nicola, Joseph, Fortunato, and so forth -- creations that could possibly take the menu out of the doldrums."
1992-10-16	SEARS CUTS RATE FOR SOME DISCOVER CARD CLIENTS	Sears, Roebuck & Company said yesterday that it would cut the interest rate on its Discover Card for some customers from 19.8 percent, to 15.9 percent or 17.9 percent, depending on how much they charge. Discover, the most widely held general purpose credit card in the country, said customers whose annual purchases with the card exceeded $1,000 would be eligible for the 15.9 percent rate beginning next year. Those who purchased more than $500 would be set at 17.9 percent. A spokesman for Sears's Discover operation said purchases averaged about $1,000 per card, but the company did not know how many of its 41 million accounts would be eligible for the lower rates. The lower rate will help Discover compete with banks and other companies, like A.T.& T., that have been lifting their shares of the credit card market by issuing Visa and Mastercard with lower interest rates.
1992-10-11	Early Salvos in the War To Capture People's Minds	"After World War I and the Russian Revolution, visual images came to the forefront in the war for people's minds. George Bernard Shaw said, ""Next to torture, art persuades most,"" but photography had taken art's place. Lenin called for the new Soviet state to create ""a political and social journalism infused with images,"" and in 1926 the Russian artist El Lissitzky wrote: ""The invention of easel-pictures produced great works of art, but their effectiveness has been lost. The cinema and the weekly magazine have triumphed."" They triumphed everywhere. Though the Soviet Union led the world in the politicization of images, some of its ideas immediately caught on elsewhere. In Germany in the 1920's, Communists founded the worker-photography movement, a bold attempt to teach workers how to photograph -- and in so doing politicize the proletariat and give it control of its own image."
1992-10-11	Everyone's Favorite Food From Italy	"DE ROSA'S, a popular local restaurant, now has De Rosa's Brick Oven Pizza at the Firehouse. The new place, with a name that telegraphs its essence, is indeed situated in a handsomely restored firehouse, the Vigilant Hose Company No. 3 (Westport's first firehouse), just off U.S. 1. To accentuate the building's origins, there are axes, a rolled-up hose and firemen's coats and helmets hanging on the brick walls of the compact dining area, which seats 38. A black ceiling, with pin lights and hanging lanterns, sets off the red brick simply and attractively. To the right of the entrance a fire burns in the large brick oven, while pizza chefs use huge wood piels to place and remove the pies over the fire. The decor is spare and so is the menu. There are 18 types of toppings for the pizza, 4 fillings for calzones, 2 salads and 2 breads, focaccia and bruschetta. Occasionally desserts are also on the menu. Actually the pizzas are so generous, there's not much need for anything else. A shared spinach salad, too generous for two, was a welcome mixture of large spinach leaves, warm bacon squares, fresh mushroom slices, hard-boiled egg halves, strips of Swiss cheese and canned black olives, with a creamy peppercorn dressing (which was on the bland side). We intended to order different small pizzas and share them, but our waiter said, ""One is really enough for two."" He was right. Even at that, the 14-inch pizza, which was listed as small on the menu, meant bagging three slices to take home. (The large pizza is 18 inches.) We were encouraged to order half one kind, half another, so we tried the Whitey Valiante and the pizza alla cioppino, both with seafood toppings that seemed compatible. The undistinguished crust had the thinness of a cracker with a cracker-like crunchiness, but was piled high on one half (the Whitey) with clams (tasty but chewy) that rang with the flavor of garlic, oregano and olive oil, with a layer of melted mozzarella. The cioppino half combined calamari and clams over a thin layer of mildly seasoned fra diavolo sauce, then topped with Romano and Parmesan cheeses. Mussels were supposed to be included as well, but were missing. Even so, the notable factor in both pizza halves was the sheer abundance of ingredients. Unlike some pizza parlors, where skimpy ingredients are concealed under an avalanche of molten cheese, the De Rosa pizzas were piled generously with the menu-listed ingredients and minimal tomato sauce and cheese. A nice change. The same lavishness prevailed on other days in a split pizza: half firefighter Dominic Zeoli (pomodori, mozzarella and a plethora of bacon and sauteed onion slices) and pizza alla Palma (profusions of sliced fresh mushrooms, Italian sausage chunks, green and red pepper strips and the expected pomodori and mozzarella). In this instance, the crust was thicker and more bread-like. In every instance, whichever pizza we ordered, the key ingredients dominated the pie, sprinkled throughout with great magnanimity. For 50 cents extra each, 11 different ingredients are available as additions, but we wonder how the thin crust could bear any additional weight. Pizzerias abound these days, in Westport and elsewhere, and some feature unusually imaginative topping combinations. At De Rosa's Brick Oven Pizza at the Firehouse, the pies are more traditional, but what gives this small place its signature is its generosity, both in the size of pizzas and the abundance of ingredients used. There is no liquor license but there are a few wines by the glass and a small beer selection that includes the New Haven-produced Elm City beer. A La Carte Anyone who thinks Japanese cuisine consists mostly of sushi, sashimi, tempura, sukiyaki and teriyaki, should drop by Kotobuki (457 Summer Street, Stamford; 359-4747). The growing number of Japanese people living in and around Fairfield County area has led Kotobuki to expand its menu. Most of the new items are appetizers like dobin mushi (a broth with mushrooms that is served in a tiny teapot), haze (small white fish and vegetable tempura), yanagawa nobe (an eel dish with burdick root), tiny cooked octopus, marinated bream in boiled sake, nabe yaki udon (noodles with shrimp tempura), mozuku (a kind of seaweed) and age nasu (Japanese eggplant). The day's specials are posted on a blackboard. De Rosa's Brick Oven Pizza At the Firehouse Good 6 Wilton Road (between U.S. 1 and Kings Highway), Westport; 221-1769.

1992-10-09	G.M. Issues Millionth Card	The General Motors Corporation said today that it had signed its millionth credit card account this week, less than a month after introducing its G.M. Mastercard on Sept. 9.
1992-10-04	"DINING OUT;
Some Pleasant Memories in Tuckahoe"	"DINERS hankering for the kind of clean, New Wave American cooking Mamaroneck's defunct American Bistro delivered in its heyday can experience a pleasant deja vu not too far away in Tuckahoe. In close quarters reminiscent of those in Mamaroneck, Robert Horton, one of the chefs at the old place, now re-creates many of the dishes once so very popular there -- and then. But it seems that without periodic refreshening and re-evaluating, yesterday's cutting edge can easily become today's butter knife. That is to say, although the food here is fresh, attractively presented and, for the most part, competently prepared -- as of old -- we wish the kitchen had, somewhere along the way, grown a bit and developed a few culinary surprises.

Look among the specials for a particularly delectable starter of grilled shrimp with creamy spinach and roasted peppers slippery with good olive oil. Less engaging were the beer-batter shrimp on the regular menu, the taut shrimp encased in batter crisped without but still slightly raw at center. Tart cherries relieved the honey-mustard dipping sauce of some of its excessive sweetness. A superb cream of squash soup redolent of fresh sweet basil was the soup of the day."
1992-10-04	"DINING OUT;
A Legion of Standards and Variations"	"""NO man is lonely while eating spaghetti,"" Robert Morley is quoted as saying. That might have been inspired by Bellissimo's, a most popular neighborhood ristorante in a Passaic County shopping strip just south of the Willowbrook Mall.

This is an unassuming storefront sandwiched between a delicatessen and a Roy Rogers outlet. Yet on week nights, the tables usually turn at least once, and the line of waiting diners on weekends often fills up the tiny foyer and backs out onto the sidewalk."
1992-10-04	In Riverside, Specialties of North India	AN annex to a Howard Johnson's on U.S.1 in Riverside may seem an unlikely place to find an Indian restaurant, especially one with a Sikh in turban as a doorman. But guests enter Taj Mahal (past the uniformed Sikh) via a long canopy-covered walkway, bordered by flowers in full bloom. The spacious dining room is artfully separated into several areas, with generously spaced tables. One table in the rear is isolated under an appliqued Gujerat canopy. White wicker settees and chairs, brass Indian sculptures, puppets, wall hangings and taped Indian music all create an atmospheric backdrop for delicious North Indian specialties. We began with bhel poori, a cold appetizer rarely found on Indian menus in the area. It consisted of a melange of rice, peas, onions, chopped tomatoes and generous bits of fresh coriander laced with a sweet-sour tamarind sauce that tickled the palate as a starter should. Almost as lively was dahi aloo poori, another salad-like cold dish of potato chunks and onions, with similar tamarind verve, in a tangy yogurt bath.
1992-10-03	How Thieves Try to Horn In On Your Credit-Card Accounts	Howard Greene, a New York executive, had reason to be livid earlier this year. One of his credit cards had been rejected by a store clerk. The next day, his wife, who had another credit card, received a letter from the issuer asking her to confirm that she had changed her address. Both the Greenes were victims of fraud. After many weeks of frustration, Mr. Greene, who always pays his bills on time, discovered that the account on the first credit card was delinquent because a thief had persuaded the issuer to provide an additional card and to send all bills to another address. A similar operation was under way with his wife's account, but it was unsuccessful because the issuer took the time and trouble to confirm the request before mailing a new card.
1992-10-02	Easy Diner's Road Map to the Hudson Valley	"IN the 1954 film ""The Wild One,"" Marlon Brando, the leader of a rowdy motorcycle gang, roars into a small town, takes a shine to a cafe waitress, eventually smashes up the place and terrorizes the citizens, then high-tails it out of town. In my less confrontational 1992 fantasy, I bomb into small towns in a gang of one, drop into restaurants with nerdy helmet-flattened hair and wind-blown clothes (no cafe Casanova, to be sure), eat as much as possible while surreptitiously scribbling notes, then careen down the road considerably heavier than I arrived. Hardly movie fodder, but it's great fun."
1992-09-30	SEARS SHIFTING AIM BACK TO RETAILING	Sears, Roebuck & Company said yesterday that it planned to dispose of its securities business, Discover credit card and real estate operations and to sell up to 20 percent of its Allstate insurance subsidiary in a public stock offering. The broad thrust of the announcement represented the final burial of the decade-old Sears vision of providing middle-class consumers with almost every conceivable type of banking, investment and real estate service in addition to the clothes, appliances and other goods that had made the company a retailing legend in more than a century of business.
1992-09-27	A Small Menu Mostly From the Grill	RIDING the crest of the trend for grilled dishes is Chop Chop American Grill in Westport. The word grill in a restaurant's name suggests not only fresh foods simply prepared but also telegraphs casual and informal, which suggests economical dining as well -- a suggestion not always borne out in the pricing. Chop Chop American Grill is in a free-standing building that has housed several other restaurants in recent years (most recently Checkers). A fence-enclosed outside dining area has been added in front, which is very pleasant as long as the weather remains cooperative. Inside the rather dark, medium-small main dining area (there's a second dining room upstairs) the decor is simple, with creamy-tone stucco walls, velveteen cafe curtains, matching wall hangings and area separators, appliqued with patches of patterned fabric suggesting stylized cows. We're not sure whether this free association is valid, though steaks are on the menu.
1992-09-27	Bank Robbers' Latest Weapon: Social Security Numbers	"WILLIE SUTTON robbed banks, the story goes, because ""that's where the money is."" But a new breed of thieves is finding that the easiest access to a bank's money is not through the vault but through the customer. As thievery progresses from the stick-up to more subtle ploys, one increasingly common tactic is as simple as using a depositor's Social Security number to pilfer a bank account. For example, the thief might call the bank to change the address of a victim's account and order new checks, which are then used for cash withdrawals."
1992-09-27	Authentic Taste of Thailand in Bay Shore	SIAM LOTUS proves once again that good things often come in small packages. The tiny Bay Shore storefront startles bored palates with some of the best Thai food on Long Island. The winning formula at this restaurant is a familiar one. The owners are on the spot. The husband is in the front and the wife in the kitchen. He is a gracious host and waiter, and she is a talented chef.
1992-09-20	Sandy Weill, Takeover Prince, Goes on the Prowl Again	"Sanford I. Weill is a picture of concentration, staring at the sea of stock prices and business headlines rolling across the Quotron in his top-floor office in midtown Manhattan. Now and then, his eyes narrow and he nods in silent recognition. Has the chairman and chief executive of the Primerica Corporation spotted a new takeover target? Perhaps. Many seasoned Weill-watchers say that one of corporate America's most prolific dealmakers is once again eager to pounce.

""Sandy is on the prowl,"" said Perrin Long, an analyst for the First of Michigan Corporation."
1992-09-20	From Fast Food to a Roadside Garden	A GARDEN CAFE in Riverside offers a very appealing place to eat along the Boston Post Road. Taking a small freestanding, roadside fast food dispensary and turning it into an attractive restaurant would have been challenge enough. Add to that an unpromising, noisy location facing the Post Road and the problems might have seemed insurmountable. But the owners of Duval Catering have covered all the windows with airy matchstick blinds that let light in, but keep noise and kitchen distractions out. The tables in the L-shaped interior have summery, floral-patterned cloths topped with glass and pink paper place mats and napkins. Lighting is soft but not dim and the net effect is modest but pleasing. The major achievement, though, is outside, where an exuberant garden of zinnias, rose of Sharon, mallows, snapdragons, petunias, chrysanthemums and 7-to-10-ft-high cosmos are blooming, planted thick enough to form a hedge that successfully screens out the sight and most of the traffic noise from the Post Road just beyond. Three large tables are outdoors, surrounded by the luxurious blooms. Near one table a parakeet twitters in a cage. In spirit, one could be in the countryside, miles from traffic of any kind.
1992-09-20	A Touch of the Farm in Suburban Roslyn	FRIEND OF A FARMER turns a Roslyn storefront into a farmhouse kitchen. Stacks of homey baked goods greet diners. Other edible first impressions are the baskets and bins of farmstand-fresh vegetables and fruit. The restaurant is reassuringly rural with its brick and wide-plank floors, rustic barn beams, hanging lanterns, stone fireplaces and shelves of preserves and canning jars filled with the harvest's bounty. In the background is a mural of a picturesque farm complete with barns, fields and cows.
1992-09-18	A.T.& T. SAYS IT HAS 10 MILLION UNIVERSAL CARD ACCOUNTS	A.T.& T. said its Universal credit card now had more than 10 million accounts. The company also announced that it was cutting the interest rate on the card to 14.9 percent from 15.4 percent. The announcements, on Wednesday, held little surprise for industry analysts, who had expected some breast beating from A.T.& T. to counter the widespread news coverage in the last two weeks of new credit cards from General Electric and General Motors.
1992-09-16	Symbols That Win, or Lose, Consumers' Seal of Approval	WHAT'S in a name? Never mind, it's what's in a logo that matters. According to a survey by the Schechter Group, a New York corporate-identity consultant, consumer attitudes about brands and the companies marketing them are significantly influenced by logo design, color and other components.
1992-09-13	Raising the Stakes In a War of Plastic	The plastic thicket of credit cards has grown denser in the last two weeks with announcements from General Motors and General Electric that they will market new cards. More junk mail can be disorienting for anyone trying to find the best terms available, but the new cards are nevertheless welcome news for consumers. Taken together, they provide a good indication of how the growing competition in the business has forced credit-card issuers, including a growing number of companies that are not banks, to offer better terms to attract or hold on to customers.
1992-09-10	G.M.'s Bold Move Into Credit Cards	The credit card introduced yesterday by the General Motors Corporation brandishes a long list of features that make it, some industry analysts say, the most important new national card since A.T.& T. introduced its Universal card in March 1990. Good news for consumers, bad news for competitors. The features are a sign that consumers stand to benefit from the growing competition among banks and nonbanks for trustworthy credit risks. G.M.'s card, whose primary mission is to help the auto maker sell cars by building brand loyalty through offering rebates, is likely to take a toll on some smaller players and continue the consolidation under way among credit card companies. In the last five years, the market share of the top 10 card issuers has increased to 51.5 percent from 37 percent.
1992-09-09	G.M. Expected to Announce Details of New Credit Card	Think of it as a frequent drivers card. The General Motors Corporation is expected to make a widely anticipated announcement today that it will issue a new Mastercard and possibly a Visa credit card designed to build loyalty among car buyers.
1992-09-06	Where Pork Is the Highlight of the Menu	EARLY in 1991 a new barbecue restaurant in Stamford opened and in a few months was replaced by another, using much the same decor, some of the original ownership and a menu with some of the same items, but many new ones as well. Thus Stick to Your Ribs became Circle J Texas Pit Barbeque and American Grille. The first sight to meet your eyes on opening the door in the entry is a large, colorful mural of a cowboy on a rearing horse against a Texas landscape. Inside, stainless steel equipment and take-out counter are on the left. To the right is a small dining area with a bar in the rear and a flight of stairs in the middle, leading up to a larger dining room, where on weekend evenings there is live music. In the early part of the week that roomy upstairs area is roped off.
1992-09-05	Credit Cards on the Rise in High Schools	"When Saskia Herz, a 16-year-old high school student, needed to buy some expensive supplies this summer for a photography class, she didn't bring along her mother. She brought along a credit card. ""I don't use it that much,"" said Ms. Herz, who has had a credit card since she was 13. ""Because when I do, I have to pay it back out of my allowance."""
1992-09-03	New Credit Card From G.E. To Offer Merchant Coupons	The GE Capital Corporation introduced a new credit card yesterday that offers discount coupons and rebates from 24 large companies, including Kmart, Macy's, Northwest Airlines, Sprint and Hertz. At a time when competition in the credit card industry is intensifying as banks reduce interest rates and cut annual fees, GE Capital, a unit of the General Electric Company, and its merchant partners are offering a card that is not as cheap as many others, but which offers sizable benefits to those who use it.
1992-08-30	Seafood Plus Italian and Japanese Fare	A LETTER from a reader led us recently to Clearwaters, a restaurant less than a year old, situated in a small roadside shopping center in Monroe. (Though C.I.A. -- Culinary Intelligence Apparatus -- is not 100 percent reliable, in this case it served us well.) Modest looking from the outside, Clearwaters does not instantly compel you to enter the premises. Once inside, there is nothing especially riveting about the decor. There are two dining areas: smoking in the front facing the windows and a larger nonsmoking dining room in the rear. Both are studies in pastels. In the back room, pale robin's-egg blue walls are hung with framed prints, wreaths of dried flowers and strands of garlic. There is oak wainscoting around much of the room, and the dark blue-green padding of the Art Deco chairs echoes the wall color. The tone is pleasantly low-key. Adding a welcoming touch is the friendliness of staff members, who are attentive and seem anxious to please.
1992-08-28	Restaurants	Steak Frites Four-month-old Steak Frites, a clamorous, no-frills bistro near Union Square that produces better than average food, often has the appearance of a place that is nearly out of control. The impression begins with your arrival. On two of four visits, no one was at the reception desk. We lingered. A short time later, a woman lunged back to her post and looked up at the growing backlog of patrons with a startled expression befitting a tax delinquent confronted by a team of Internal Revenue Service agents. On a preliminary visit to Steak Frites three weeks after it opened, I must have been served by the best waiter in the place, for more recent experiences bordered on the chaotic. The staff mixed up drink orders or never brought them at all, served dishes to the wrong parties and allowed meals to drag on, especially at lunch, when the pace should be prompt. At lunch one day, to my amazement, a table of three was served two wrong appetizers. One of our orders, we learned almost 30 minutes after ordering, was not even available that day.
1992-08-25	Mastercard Picks Ammirati To Energize Lagging Effort	MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL said yesterday that it had selected Ammirati & Puris Inc. in New York to handle the creative portion of its United States account, estimated at $60 million. The decision ended a six-month search by the bank credit card issuer for an agency to reinvigorate its advertising and marketing efforts, which have been perceived as too sluggish and unfocused for its intensely competitive market. The decision on the closely watched review, which began Feb. 25, went down to the wire, as executives from the two finalist shops -- Ammirati and Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis -- met yesterday in New York for one more time with Mastercard's top management and a committee of executives from Mastercard member banks.
1992-08-25	BUSINESS DIGEST	The Economy Rochester's model health care system is being studied by the G.A.O. for a report to Congress. Close cooperation -- in contrast to fierce competition nationally -- among physicians, hospitals and local businesses, has kept medical costs 25 percent lower per capita than national levels, and most people are insured. The city's doctors are conservative in medical practice. [ Page A1. ] Five diet companies petitioned the F.T.C. to set standards and regulations for fair advertising in the $33 billion industry, which has been under Federal investigation. Critics called the petition a delaying tactic. The companies are Jenny Craig, NutriSystem, Physician's Weight Loss, Diet Center and Weight Watchers. [ D1. ] International The dollar plunged 2 percent against the German mark, to a new low of 1.4015, despite central bank intervention. The mark is attractive because of high German interest rates. [ D1. ]
1992-08-24	News Involving 2 Accounts Puts Some Pep Into August	DOG days on Madison Avenue? Hardly. A burst of activity last week involving two accounts totaling about $45 million in billings belied the notion that nothing happens in advertising in August. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. said Friday that it had parted ways with Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. in New York, 20 months after Shearson, a division of the American Express Company, moved its estimated $20 million account there from Ally & Gargano.
1992-08-23	Casual and Overlooking Lake Montauk	WATER views abound on Long Island, but restaurants have been slow to take advantage of them. This year, things are changing, for 1992 may be the year of the nautical view. In the spring, Starr Boggs moved his Westhampton restaurant to the beach, and diners have been enjoying meals accompanied by crashing surf and smashing sunsets. On the North Shore, the Crescent restaurant in Bayville has been wowing crowds with its picture-postcard beach vistas. The latest winning water views are at the new Waterfront on Lake Montauk in Montauk. Go at dusk, when lights start popping on around the shore.
1992-08-21	Restaurants	City Cafe In many respects, City Cafe is a prototypical summer-in-the-city restaurant: cool and casual, with whitewashed walls, white tiles, servers in white aprons, an outdoor cafe and an Upper East Side clientele that appears to spend a significant percentage of its seasonal income on Bain de Soleil. Moreover, the food is quite good. One could not make such a statement about the cooking several years ago, when City Cafe was just another stylish space turning out shaky American fare. Earlier this year, however, the owners, Eric and Cathy Miller, signed on an enterprising new chef, Marc Salonsky. Mr. Salonsky has spent time at several leading Manhattan restaurants, including the former Maurice in the Parker-Meridien Hotel on West 57th Street and Petrossian on Seventh Avenue. Judging by the food at City Cafe, Mr. Salonsky seems more comfortable, indeed happier, in this less rarefied setting.
1992-08-16	Italian Food, Sunny Style, Moderate Prices	THE quarters of the New Orleans-style Bourbon Street in Stamford has been taken over, with relatively few decorating changes, by Vicolo's Ristorante Italiano. Inside is a large room with brass railings, cane-back chairs and frosted-glass panels separating tiered dining areas. What used to be a raw bar in front has been replaced by a pizza oven. Seemingly unchanged is the sunny greenhouse in the rear (facing the parking lot), which is especially pleasant for lunch.
1992-08-16	The Latest in Buzzwords: Mailed From America	After celebrating morning mass at the Good Shepherd Church near his modest brick flat in Morecambe, a seaside resort in Lancashire, England, the Rev. Michael J. Smith eagerly watches for a little green van that more and more often is pulling up to his front door. The van signals the arrival of yet another product he has ordered by mail from the United States. Since he first saw an advertisement for mail-order shopping direct from the United States in a computer magazine about two years ago, Father Smith reckons he has spent more than $4,000, mostly on computer software.
1992-08-07	Restaurants	La Topiaire The Broadway theater district can never have too many moderately priced, dependable restaurants, and La Topiaire, a 10-month-old effort on West 45th Street, promises to be a crowd pleaser. In four visits, however, there were scarcely any crowds to please. Such is the precarious restaurant business today. La Topiaire is owned by Joel Benjamin, a native of Brittany who worked at Lutece for 11 years before going out on his own, and his wife, Danuta, who runs the dining room. The foliage theme is represented by miniature sculptured trees lining an overhead balcony, by more trees on the tables and by black-and-white photos on the walls. The white-walled ground-floor dining room is comfortable and pleasant; to reach the second level one ascends two flights of stairs, passing an isolated table on the landing. It would be a great perch up there if there were something to see other than monochromatic West 45th Street. Moreover, in certain chairs, the overhead pinpoint lighting can make a police interrogation room appear soothing.
1992-08-07	Diner's Journal	Scandinavian and Casual The number of Scandinavian restaurants in Manhattan doubled last month -- from one to two -- with the opening of Snaps on Park Avenue at 46th Street, a rakish, casual cousin of Aquavit on West 54th Street. The airy setting in the Helmsley Building is sunny yellow and has a long marble-topped bar, bent-cane chairs and, moored on overhead crossbeams, a representation of a Viking longboat. Waiters, who have yet to get their sea legs, wear snazzy brown and green shirts with ties that are about as subtle as the walls. Fans of Aquavit will recognize some of the herring, venison and salmon dishes. A starter of salmon ravioli with dill sauce was leathery and thick, although the sauce was refreshing ($6). Gravlax is the real thing here, not merely salmon with some dill tossed on it, as you find in so many restaurants ($7). I could do with half the sauce they slather over it, though. The same good gravlax can be ordered with a plump potato cake ($7). Tuna carpaccio ($7) is served warm and half-cooked on the hot plate, which is a surprise. Moreover, it is served under an avalanche of mild Scandinavian cheese, which all but obscures it.
1992-08-02	"DINING OUT;
Romance and History in Dover Plains"	"OLD DROVERS INN is unusual in that it is one of the few inns operating continuously since Colonial times. What's even more unusual, the place has escaped the acoustical tiles and formica of modernization. Loving care has preserved the head-grazing 18th-century beams, uneven floors, pewter mugs, yawning fireplaces -- all illuminated by the candlelight flickering behind lovely hurricane lamps -- and has kept the inn a fascinating historical place as well as indisputedly romantic one.

Part of the menu is rooted solidly in the past: sturdy cheese soups and corn chowders, mashed parsnips and red wine oxtail sauce, turkey hash and double cut lamb chops, food that no doubt sustained the eponymous drover on his way to New York City with his herds of cattle and swine. But along with other items on the menu, these rib-stickers are prepared with a light and inventive touch, showing the kitchen to be as savvy about the dietary requirements of the 1990's as it is about the nourishment of the past."
1992-07-26	"DINING OUT;
By the River, a Japanese Change of Pace"	"WHEN Chinzan-So in Edgewater closed its doors last winter, aficionados of refined Japanese dining and big spenders alike were disappointed. That spectacular-looking restaurant, perched on the Hudson River south of Fort Lee behind the Yaohan Plaza shopping center, catered especially to Japanese businessmen with expense accounts.

But Chinzan-So's formality and elaborate multicourse menus were more suited to the extravagant 1980's than today's economic climate, and even the Japanese are evidently cutting back."
1992-07-26	"DINING OUT;
A View of the Tappan Zee From Piermont"	"WHETHER lingering under umbrellas on the cement patio that sweeps out from this round, glass-enclosed Rockland restaurant or sitting in the dining room itself, diners clearly come here for the joy of the view. Perched at the tip of a spit of land that juts into the Hudson River, the Mooring looks beyond the bosky shoreline and buildings of Nyack to the Tappan Zee Bridge (sparkling at night) and the immensity of the great river and its curves to the north. 

Close to hand, small boats and cruisers sway at anchor, and invariably, as diners watch, a boat will detach itself from the marina's dock onto the sunlit waterway. The flow of human travel is everywhere. Autos and trucks move, it seems with great leisure, across the bridge; boats skim, curl and zigzag to a weekend captain's whimsy, and across the river the silvery length of a Hudson Line train follows the river to Tarrytown. It's too bad one can't eat the scenery."
1992-07-26	New Thai Place Offers Welcome Variety	A NEW restaurant called Fork and Spoon recently opened its doors on Main Street in Danbury. Like the restaurant that previously occupied the storefront space, this, too, is Thai, with just a handful of Chinese dishes on the menu. The name Fork and Spoon is a reminder not to ask for chopsticks: Thais mainly use spoons, with forks as backup. The medium-size storefront space has been nicely rejuvenated. Freshly painted apricot-color walls are hung with a few Thai plaques and shelves displaying blue and white ginger jars, cheerful floral-pattern tablecloths (under glass) match draperies at the front windows, and a muted blue carpet is on the floor. It is obvious that an effort is being made.
1992-07-24	Restaurants	Often when a restaurant changes its name, its decor and its cuisine, one can liken the effort to fussing with the mainsail while water gushes in through the galley. Not so in the case of Hosteria Fiorella (formerly just Fiorella), a winsome Italian seafood grill that has made both cosmetic and substantive improvements. Not only is the setting cheerful and appealing, but also the food is sparkling fresh and prepared with verve. One doesn't grasp the scope of the refurbishment from the street, where all that's visible is the bar and reception area. Upon first glance the smaller of the two dining rooms has a peculiar design motif: inside what look like giant translucent blocks of ice mounted on the walls are dozens of hand-painted wooden fish. In contrast, the long, rectangular main dining rooms are done in a Conran's-goes-to-Vermont theme, an amalgam of mismatched blond wood tables, rustic murals, mirrors, quilts and a (fake) fireplace with an electric log. The overall effort works, however, creating a relaxed, informal feeling.
1992-07-19	"DINING OUT;
Where Dishes Reflect a Personal Flair"	"THOSE who are tired of run-of-the-mill restaurants may well find that Pierre's, a four-month-old bistro in Morristown, between the town green and the Morris County Courthouse, is the answer. 

The tiny bistro is owned by Michael Peters and his wife, Marybeth. They recently returned from a four-year stint in Ireland, where they ran a highly acclaimed restaurant that was in the wrong area for financial success. Before that, they were the originators of a bare-bones restaurant, the Brass Rail, which was above a bar in Hoboken. At that time, it was one of the most exciting restaurants around, in part because of its surprising location, and also because the food that emanated from Mr. Peters's kitchen was delightful and reasonably priced."
1992-07-12	"DINING OUT;
A Seasonal Menu With Eclectic Choices"	"IN Cape May, the gingerbread watering hole at the southern tip of the Shore, the crop of engaging restaurants is fertile enough to keep an adventurous diner happily eating out for a week. 

The latest addition to the resort's offerings is Peaches at Sunset, in a charmingly converted old house on the west side of town. It is an offshoot of the Peaches Cafe, a sidewalk eating place on Carpenter's Lane. Both places are namesakes of George Pechin, nicknamed Peach, who is the chef and, with Craig Needles, co-owner of this three-month-old dining spot."
1992-07-12	Darien Gets a New Chinese Restaurant	THE economy may stumble but chances are there will always be a new Chinese restaurant opening. One of the most attractive to do so in recent months is Li's Brothers Inn in Darien. The restaurant, which occupies a large space in the Good Wives Shopping Center, is obviously a serious enterprise, not a neighborhood chop suey parlor. Frosted glass panels at the entrance lead into a spacious dining room with a pale plum patterned wallpaper, Chinese art and lacquered wainscoting. A green and rose carpet, well-spaced tables with comfortable high-back chairs and tapes of soft Chinese music add to the dining experience, which is enhanced considerably by an unusually considerate and well-trained staff.
1992-07-10	Restaurants	Josephina is Manhattan's newest and most ambitious health-oriented restaurant -- well, sort of. True, the kitchen does not fry, eschews most dairy products and serves mountains of crunchy greens and grains that act as little snowplows of the arteries. Yet you can still get a hamburger at lunch, a fatty Long Island duck at dinner and egg-thickened creme brulee anytime. One of the agreeable aspects of this sprawling restaurant on Broadway at 63d Street, just across from Lincoln Center, is that the owners do not bludgeon customers with the club of nutrition. The chef, Louis Lanza, tries to keep cardiovascular bogymen away from the door, but not at the expense of flavor. Moreover, the upbeat, easygoing staff minimizes the perception that you are doing something good for yourself.
1992-07-05	On the Road, Three Places for Lunch	PLACES that are popular with local people for reliable fare in agreeable, casual surroundings are difficult for out-of-towners to find. Here, then, for travelers around the state are three places where a pleasant meal can be enjoyed without ado. The most popular spot in Pomfret for casual eating is the VANILLA BEAN CAFE. The building, a restored 19th-century barn, is hard to miss, even though it is set back from the road. In front is a large gravel parking area with a few umbrella tables.
1992-07-01	Consumers Hesitant in the Heartland	After several years of profound economic malaise, businesses and consumers in much of the country appear to be emerging, at last, from the recession. But while they say they are more hopeful than they were a few months ago, most people are by no means convinced that their woes are past. The recovery has yet to take hold in the Northeast or in California. But in interviews in and around Salt Lake City, Omaha and here in Centralia in the last week, dozens of people provided evidence that the economic recovery remained spotty and that even in areas of relative strength, faith in the recovery was thin. Consumers and businesses hold dampened expectations and neither group is likely to shed the caution adopted over the last several years. 'Depends on Who You Are'
1992-06-28	"DINING OUT;
Stopping Off en Route to the Berkshires"	"AS Route 22 winds past antique shops and toward concert sites and idyllic vacation areas in the Berkshires, travelers seeking a decent eating spot have the Fine Foods Cafe in Pawling. If we were to take a visitor from abroad to a restaurant emblematic of American cuisine in the 90's, we'd come here. The young partners -- Shannon McKinney and Brian Doyle -- have brought to this enterprise all the skill, good taste and humor that have long been hallmarks of their Corner Bakery. Every preparation is executed with wit, ingenuity and a brilliant juxtaposition of colors, flavors and textures.

A New England tidiness surrounds the engaging restaurant set in Pawling's center. Down the street old clapboard homes still absorb splashes from the road they were meant to be near; the renowned views and rolling farms of Dutchess County are moments away. Inside, lovely exposed-brick walls are covered with botanical and architectural prints; old-fashioned wooden booths line the walls, and well-polished dining tables and chairs fill the center of the oak-floor room."
1992-06-28	"DINING OUT;
Stylish Versions of Regional Italian Fare"	"WHETHER their teams are winning or not, sports fans at the Meadowlands have cause to cheer the arrival of a with-it new trattoria in nearby Wood-Ridge. For those who want to have a good meal before or after the game, Assagia turns out stylish versions of regional Italian dishes at reasonable prices.

Open since October, the casually smart double storefront sports a bright blue and yellow awning that stands out in the working-class Bergen County neighborhood. The proprietor, Ciro Santoro, who was formerly maitre d'hotel at Bouley in Manhattan, is usually on hand to greet arrivals and to keep an eye on the service."
1992-06-28	Thai Food in the Heart of New Haven	IN the late 1980's, Thai restaurants seemed to open with alacrity, but the pace has slowed over the last couple of years. That probably has as much to do with economics as with any possibility that the public is sated with the delicate yet fiery cuisine. Nevertheless, a new Thai restaurant, Bangkok Gardens, has opened smack in the center of New Haven, near the Yale University campus and across the street from the Yale Repertory Theater.
1992-06-23	BUSINESS DIGEST	International BMW is expected to announce Spartanburg, S.C., will be the site of its new assembly plant. It would put the German maker of motorcycles, sports cars and sedans in a league with the big Japanese auto makers that have set up assembly operations in the United States and led in low-cost mass production. [ Page D1. ] Leaders in South Carolina cited the state's location and harbors, its quality of life and its pro-business climate as lures. [ D6. ] Establishing American plants is attractive because of the size of the vehicle market, growing protectionist sentiment and the weakening dollar. [ D7. ]
1992-06-23	DEAN WITTER LOSES BID TO ISSUE MASTERCARDS	"Mastercard has rejected a request by the Dean Witter Financial Services Group to become an issuer of Mastercards. Dean Witter, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company, already issues the Discover credit card, and Mastercard said Discover, which is also owned by Sears, was a direct competitor. ""Discover wants to both compete with and participate in the Mastercard franchise,"" said Peter S. P. Dimsey, head of Mastercard's American business. ""They can't have it both ways."""
1992-06-14	"DINING OUT;
Eclectic 5-Course Dinners in a Small Inn"	"AT the Shore, where tank tops and flip-flops are typical attire and fried seafood the usual fare, the refined little Green Gables Inn and Restaurant is a real find.  Long Beach Island insiders know that the quaint Victorian bed-and-breakfast offers inventive five-course set dinners to the public, but only by reservation. That's because this Ocean County inn has only seven tables in its two intimate dining rooms, plus a few more on the porch. 

Open the year round, the converted 1880's house is owned by Rita and Adolfo DeMartino, who decorated it themselves and opened it to guests three summers ago. Though it is only half a block from the main street, not far from Kapler Pharmacy, the setting has a small-town feel."
1992-06-14	An Italian Restaurant That's Aged Well	WHEN we first visited Da Pietro in Westport in 1988, we found it very good indeed. Unlike all too many restaurants, it has improved with age. For one thing, desserts were negligible then; now they are skillful creations that provide the proper exclamation point to the meal. While the menu hasn't changed dramatically, the culinary skills seem ever more authoritative. Sauces and combinations work as never before. The simple, minuscule storefront looks the same: white-washed walls hung with tapestry banners; a floral-printed, comfortable banquette along one wall; ladderback chairs with cushions to match the banquette; a gleaming copper bain-marie with a fresh flower display in a partition separating kitchen from dining space.
1992-06-07	"DINING OUT;
A Personal Style in International Dishes"	"THE Cummings International Cuisine Restaurant, which opened almost a year ago in a former root beer stand on Englishtown Road in the Middlesex County town of Old Bridge, is somewhat unusual. With all the grills and bistros that are popping up, along comes a small and very individual restaurant that serves dishes from all over the world.

Tatiana Cummings (who is half Chinese, half Russian) met her husband, Daniel (half German, half American), in Belgium, where they were both studying for master's degrees in languages and where they later owned restaurants specializing in Eurasian food."
1992-06-07	Where the Wine List Alone Is Worth a Trip	ROSELAND COTTAGE, the Henry Bowen house in Woodstock (in the northeast corner of the state), makes a delightful attraction for anyone interested in architecture and history. And for day-trippers, the discovery of a good restaurant nearby adds considerably to an outing. Though the Harvest at Bald Hill in South Woodstock is in a sprawling red barn-like building at the junction of Routes 169 and 171, the restaurant inside is not barnlike at all. Its dark brown wood-panel walls and dark ceiling would be gloomy if not enhanced by ample windows, clever lighting from lampshade-shape wall sconces and table lights. A tiny string of lights looped along the draperies at the end of a succession of cozy dining areas adds a festive look. In warm weather a screened porch makes a pleasant place for dining, especially at lunch. Overflow dining is also possible in the separate bar.
1992-05-31	Food as Lure or Accessory to Gambling	RECENTLY we decided to have a firsthand look at the Foxwoods Casino that opened in February on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation, near Ledyard Center. We discovered four restaurants on the premises, one of which, the Pequot Grill, seemed a notch above the mass feeding expected in such establishments, so we decided to give it a try. The casino, a long building in the tan and beige tones of the Southwest rather than the Northeast, is tucked into piney woods. It is completely unobtrusive in the peaceful countryside: no neon, no billboards, no Las Vegas glitz. To find Foxwoods, a driver follows small signs with a discreet turquoise and coral logo.
1992-05-24	"DINING OUT;
Best Choices: Appetizers and Desserts"	"THE menu is usually a good indication of the quality of a restaurant, but sometimes the menu may surpass the cooking. This is the case at the Milestone Restaurant, a nine-month-old establishment in the Urban Farms Shopping Center in the Bergen County community of Franklin Lakes.

The attractive but simply decorated storefront restaurant has a menu that sounds exciting in its scope. It ranges from simple dishes to more exotic ones, like duck breast with port wine sauce, or venison or wild boar (served Friday and Saturday). But the reality of the dishes doesn't live up to the expectation created by the menu."
1992-05-24	Where Patrons Can Design Their Own Pizza	IMAGINE walking into a restaurant for the second time and finding that everything looks the same -- except the name. It's about what happened to us in New Canaan recently when we strolled down the brick walkway leading to the back of the building on Main Street that housed the Sunrise Pizza Cafe, which had opened to much praise last summer. But in its place was another pizza parlor called Tom E Toes (as in tomatoes), which utilizes the identical low-key decor (a stylized rendering of a map of Italy on the stairwell, posters and signs in the main, second-floor dining space). Like its predecessor, Tom E Toes also serves the Norwalk-made Atlantic Amber beer as well as Italian wines. Even our waiter looked familiar; he had survived the change in ownership.
1992-05-19	Say It With Plastic: 'I Love New York'	"New York City could raise additional revenue yearly -- arguably at least $5 million -- and make life easier for residents by issuing a credit card.

Collaborating with a major bank, the city could develop and market an ""I Love New York"" Visa and Mastercard, say, with a Big Apple hologram on the plastic card."
1992-05-17	English-Style Inn With Ambitious Menu	WHAT began as a boys' school in 1894 in Washington evolved into the Mayflower Inn in 1920. Mild modifications were made with each change of ownership, but massive renovations by the current owners, Adriana and Robert Mnuchin, have transformed the low-key inn into a bona fide country hotel, with echoes of England in each wood-paneled, comfortably furnished public room. The main dining room is no exception. A spacious, carpeted room overlooks the lawn and a Shakespeare garden in progress, and is furnished with comfortably padded chairs, tables set with silver candlesticks and walls hung with traditional paintings. The formal style of the well-lighted room is warmed by the friendly staff. Two smaller dining areas open off the main room.
1992-05-06	NBC in a CBS Promotion? Well, It's Not That NBC	CBS will join forces with NBC to promote the CBS lineup of prime-time programs for the 1992-93 season. But before the Justice Department gets inquisitive, in this instance the initials stand for the Nabisco Biscuit Company. At a news conference in New York this morning, CBS will announce that Nabisco Biscuit, part of the Nabisco Foods Group of RJR Nabisco Inc., will replace the Kmart Corporation as the lead partner in the network's fourth annual consumer promotion tied to its fall-season series.
1992-05-05	Mastercard and Visa in a Debit-Card Battle	Visa and Mastercard are fighting a heated battle to sign up banks to issue their debit cards -- the next generation of plastic competing for space in American wallets. With debit cards, the costs of purchases are deducted immediately from consumers' checking accounts. Merchants accepting debit cards -- primarily those with high volumes like supermarkets and gas stations -- thus receive immediate payment with consumers' funds, and consumers do not receive monthly bills.
1992-05-03	"DINING OUT;
Early American Touch in Cold Spring"	"THE season for lingering out of doors is just a tulip away, and one of the most pleasant places for dawdling is Cold Spring. With its history, antiques shops and waterfront, this charming village has something for everyone. It is these very characteristics that make Hudson House such an attractive dining destination.

Poised at the river's edge, the place is ""the second oldest inn in continuous operation in New York State,"" according to the brief history on the back of the menu, and wide-plank floors, bright blue chairs and touches of pewter against plain white walls contribute to the Early American look.  Visitors unable to tear themselves away can stay in one of the inn's 15 rooms. Don't worry about not having fancy clothing; informality is definitely the style here."
1992-05-03	In New Milford, Reminders of Tastes Past	WALKING from the street into Charles Bistro in New Milford is like stepping into a time warp. This is a French restaurant like those remembered from 20 to 30 years ago in Manhattan. Even the cutout figure of a French chef outside the door is a reminder of times past. The decor contributes to a sense of welcome and homeyness: dark green wainscoting, floral pattern wallpaper with a deep rose-red background, pine floors, crisply starched white tablecloths, a rear cupboard full of colorful pottery plates, old-fashioned glass wall sconces with a soft glow, gleaming copper pots clustered above the small service bar. Even the plants hanging above the lace-curtains in the front windows and lining the window ledge are familiar touches.
1992-04-26	Italian, French and New American Menu	"CHEF MARTIN (named for chef-owner Martin Corso) is a new restaurant in Branford. It's easy to pass by -- an unprepossessing one-story white building along a commercial strip. But inside the gaily decorated dining room exudes good cheer, an intangible feeling enhanced by a friendly, eager young staff who have the enthusiasm one associates with 1930's musicals (""Hey gang, let's put on a show""). The one-room dining space has a motley charm, with dark green wainscoting, white wood walls, trapezoidal brick wall panels, cerise wood booths and trim, and a wood planter in the center of the room filled with a small ficus tree and other plantings. Pale blue tablecloths under glass tops and a candle stuck in a whole artichoke on each table complete the scene."
1992-04-24	Executive Must Sell Stores on Debit Cards	After years of false starts, Arthur D. Kranzley, the newly named president and chief executive of Maestro U.S.A., says the day is fast approaching when consumers will routinely pay merchants with plastic debit cards -- ones bearing the Maestro name, he hopes. Mr. Kranzley, 41 years old, spent seven years helping to develop a global network of automatic teller machines that accept Mastercard, which owns Maestro, and he guided the early experiments with debit cards.
1992-04-22	Sears Makes Changes In Catalogue Division	Sears, Roebuck & Company said yesterday that it would shave another 4,900 jobs from its retail operations next month by closing the counters in 860 stores in the United States where customers can pick up merchandise ordered from the company's catalogues. Customers will still be able to pick up large items like appliances at Sears stores, but smaller items will be mailed, the company said.
1992-04-19	"DINING OUT;
Japanese Cuisine With Western Touches"	"IT is always a pleasure to return to a restaurant three years after its opening to find the place humming and the food as good as ever. We are happy to report such is the case at Satsuma-ya. This new-wave Japanese restaurant has endeared itself to the community by serving not only traditional Japanese food but also delightful hybrids employing familiar Western ingredients like mashed potatoes, olive oil and cheese. Surprisingly, it all works beautifully. 

Satsuma-ya gives variety to its comprehensive basic menu by adding a number of seasonal items, and they are worth noting. For example, freshwater speckled brown trout (from the Catskills) and the first vegetables of spring have recently replaced the venison and game birds of winter."
1992-04-19	Bit of an English Pub Flavor in Bethel	HAPPILY, not just bad pennies keep turning up; good ones occasionally do, too. Such is the case with MacKenzie's Old Ale House in Bethel. Earlier MacKenzie's were in Darien, Stamford and, briefly, in New Canaan. The current and only MacKenzie's enterprise is in a building formerly occupied by a French (La Plume) and then an Italian (Pappagallo) restaurant. Fortunately, the premises -- an old frame house in Victorian Italianate style -- adapts well to the pub-like atmosphere of this MacKenzie's. Two small, dark dining rooms (with a third upstairs) and a taproom (with tables for dining) and an adjoining bar all have a cozy feel enhanced by dark green walls, wainscoting, pine floors, gilt-frame English engravings and old Colonial brass chandeliers. All that's needed is better background sound than the intrusively repetitive radio music that rattled on endlessly during our meals.
1992-04-19	F.T.C. Accuses Phone Solicitors Of Deception	"Several Daytona Beach, Fla., companies and their owners have been charged by the Federal Trade Commission with deceptively marketing travel packages to consumers nationwide through a network of telephone salesrooms. The Florida Attorney General, Robert A. Butterworth, also has filed charges against the companies. According to the F.T.C., people were told by postcard that they had won a vacation to Florida or the Bahamas. To take the trip, however, the consumer had to purchase a package for about $400, spend ""a substantial amount of money"" beyond the package cost and comply with many conditions not disclosed by telephone salespeople. The callers obtained consumers' credit card numbers, the trade commission says, by asserting that card numbers would be used only to verify credit standings. In fact, the consumers' accounts were billed for the cost of the travel package."
1992-04-17	Citibank's Credit Card Rates To Be Cut for Best Customers	Citibank, defending its position as the leading issuer of bank credit cards, said yesterday that it would reduce interest rates for nine million of its best card customers at the end of the month. The banking company is also planning other features, including a card that bears a photograph of its holder, to bolster its business. The moves by Citibank, with more than 30 million credit card customers, come when competition is rising and interest rates are generally declining. That has led many other card issuers to reduce their interest rates, cut or eliminate annual fees and offer extra benefits.
1992-04-12	"DINING OUT;
Italian Fare at Renamed Spot in Armonk"	"IN the pretty space last known as Covington, Bambina takes over with an Italian menu designed to suit all comers. Diners can choose dishes from among six categories, mixing and matching large and small items to satisfy hunger for anything from snacks to full-course meals: spuntini (or snacks that can also serve as appetizers); generous, hearty salads; pasta in half or whole orders; small pizzas; sandwiches and burgers; entrees.

The second-floor dining room remains virtually untouched, still engaging with its muted colors and intimate dining nooks. Only the decor on the first floor has been rethought, and its contemporary Italian look echoes the menu. The elaborate Victorian bar has been replaced with a sleeker model. Black metal chairs stand out against white marble-like floors. Every table bears a bottle of virgin olive oil, a carafe of ice water stoppered with a whole lemon (a charming touch), and a bowl of olives and chunks of garlic in olive oil, a tasty sop for the bread. At the entrance, a chic receptionist sits at a desk, checking reservations, and coats are taken to a check room. The stage, however, seems set for another play."
1992-04-12	"THE VIEW FROM: THE COUNTY PARKS DEPARTMENT;
Golf Courses and Playland in the Age of Computerization"	"DON'T go looking for robots just yet, but the County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation is swinging into automated gear.

A long debated proposal to establish a computerized system for making reservations at county-run golf courses will be discussed at a public meeting of the department on Wednesday at 6 P.M. at the County Center in White Plains."
1992-04-12	You Can't Tell a Restaurant by Its Name	THE Long Island Seafood Dumpling House in Stamford has a few anomalies in its name. Immediately putting aside that it's in Connecticut, not Long Island, the word dumpling suggests dim sum, yet there are very few dim sum (appetizer-like tidbits), on the menu. And while seafood represents about half the menu choices, most of these dishes are either shrimp or scallops. Then, too, the restaurant's name suggests a certain informality, while the place itself is one of the most elegant-looking Chinese restaurants in Fairfield County, with five handsome dining rooms done in pastel colors, well-spaced tables and banquettes, and walls decorated with delicate Chinese watercolors.
1992-04-10	Mastercard Sales Up	Mastercard International said sales increased by 12.5 percent, to $220.9 billion, in 1991, and its cards in circulation rose by 6.8 percent, to 171.8 million. The credit card company, which oversees operations for its members that issue the cards, said the number of locations that accept the cards grew by 7.6 percent, to 9.8 million. The Mastercard-Cirrus network expanded to more than 77,000 automated teller machines, and Mastercard traveler's checks had $10 billion in sales.
1992-04-05	"DINING OUT;
Two Spots Where Pizza Is the Specialty"	"MOST people who love to eat out have a dream that one day they will happen upon that culinary diamond in the rough, the shabby restaurant that serves haute cuisine at diner prices. This dream, we suspect, accounts for the fact that for more than a decade the name Muscoot has been whispered to us, slipped to us, pressed into our palm -- the shibboleth of the self-proclaimed culinary underground. 

The light of reality is, unfortunately, harsher. Over the years we've given Muscoot in Katonah a try and found nothing to write home about, or anywhere else for that matter. But Muscoot North in Hopewell Junction is now in full operation. A discreet stone's throw from the Taconic Parkway -- barren for miles of anything else by way of nourishment -- the location of this sister restaurant warrants a closer look at this time."
1992-04-05	"DINING OUT;
A Tempting Menu and Hearty Portions"	"FROM the outside, it doesn't look like much -- a modest storefront tucked into an unprepossessing block of downtown Long Branch. And inside, the casual setting with exposed brick walls and what look like thrift-shop finds for decorations could never be called chic. So why do the paper-covered tables at Joe & Maggie's Bistro on Broadway seem to be constantly filled with a convivial crowd of insiders?

A glance at the tempting, au courant menu and a sampling of the large portions of hearty yet inventive fare that issue from the partly open kitchen provide the answer. And given the quality of the ingredients and of the knowledgeable, solicitous service, prices are not out of line. A three-course dinner, not counting tax, tip or drinks, averages $28."
1992-04-03	Back in Style: Supper Clubs Are Reviving 40's Glamour	"ONE of the great gifts of life in New York City is the ever-present possibility of glamour. Longtime New Yorkers may scoff because the city is not what it was, they say; but a scan of the literature suggests that all cities have always been busy not being what they once were, at least according to their denizens at the time.

In any case, those of us who came here from large suburbs masquerading as cities can perhaps more readily see that in 1992 Manhattan, there are still plenty of glamorous thrills to be had, depending on how much time and money you want to spend: a glance at the Chrysler Building, a walk across Grand Central Terminal's now gloriously Kodak-signless concourse, shopping at Bergdorf Goodman, drinks at Bemelmans Bar, dinner at Bouley."
1992-03-29	"DINING OUT;
A Broad Japanese Menu in White Plains"	"IN its small size and extensive offerings both on the menu and posted on the walls, Ajiyoshi resembles the popular neighborhood restaurants one finds all over Japan. These eating spots offer, in addition to sushi, a great number of small dishes -- called appetizers on Ajiyoshi's menu. A popular way of having a Japanese meal both at home and at these neighborhood places is to assemble a selection of the small dishes, according to appetite. For less than $20 Ajiyoshi has a combination dinner (varying from day to day) with a nice selection of these little delicacies and some sushi.

Diners can eat very well here; in fact, when the best dishes are served pleasantly and willingly, dining could not be better. Uneven preparations occasionally hit the lows as well as the highs, however, and once service seemed to reflect some of this variation when, for example, our generally rude and grudging waiter insisted that the shrimp tempura he brought was the breaded and fried shrimp, ebi fry, we had ordered. Diners have little control over waiting staff, but with some know-how they can assemble a highly satisfying meal."
1992-03-29	Where the Chef Is Serious About the Food	DESPITE its name, Miche Mache is no hodgepodge of a place. Michael (Miche) Nischan, the chef-owner of the new South Norwalk restaurant (in space formerly occupied by Portofino), knows exactly what he's doing and does it with elan. There is whimsy, too, in the pricing ($4.93, $6.02, $11.74 and so forth), and in the clay garden pots used on each table to hold fresh flowers, table lights and delicious pepper-and-oregano-scented foccacia and Portuguese rolls.
1992-03-28	Sharing of Credit Card Numbers by Merchants Brings New Fears of Fraud	Each day, millions of Americans entrust their credit card numbers to businesses when they make purchases by telephone or mail. But now some businesses are selling the numbers or providing access to them without their customers' knowledge. That is creating both a new invasion of consumer privacy and fertile ground for fraud, regulators in several states say. The regulators say scores of people across the country have been charged for products and services they did not want or never received, after their credit card numbers were provided by marketing companies to other businesses. The officials say they are alarmed by the development because they see no legitimate reason to sell such information; this month, bills to prohibit sales of credit card numbers were introduced in Connecticut and New York State.
1992-03-22	"DINING OUT;
In Harrison: Italian Fare for Families"	"CLEARLY a popular establishment that is run by family for families and anyone else who happens to be in the neighborhood, That's Amore is an informal Italian restaurant serving at least acceptable food with a few bright spots. 

Renditions tend to be generous and heavy, weighty mostly with cheese -- mozzarella, Parmesan -- used recklessly wherever it appears. But for all its mass and density, the food is good of its kind. Large, convivial groups are obviously familiar with the size of the portions, and a great deal of sharing and passing the large platters of food family style seemed to be going on during all our visits. And as for prices, no one needed to run to a cash machine."
1992-03-22	"DINING OUT;
A Bistro That Plays to Packed Crowds"	"At Amanda's, a lively Hoboken bistro, the stylish, muted decor in its three intimate rooms gets more kudos, alas, than either the food or the service. But that doesn't seem to deter the city's trendy diners who squeeze into the elbow-to-elbow seats on busy weekend evenings. They come, no doubt, for the moderately priced eclectic menu, which runs the gamut from chicken nuggets to veal Marsala. 

Handsomely sponged and faux-finished walls, high ceilings and a polished wood bar backed with mirrors give the storefront a timeless charm, while white paper covering the tablecloths, the collegiate help and jazzy taped music keep it casual. A tiny room in back that seats 12 and is available for parties is fetchingly lined with a leafy mural."
1992-03-22	Kebab Offers Invitation to Afghan Cuisine	THOUGH Afghan food is unknown to many Americans, shish kebab is a staple in many places, so calling an Afghan restaurant in Hartford Shish Kebab House of Afghanistan is good marketing. Diners have a choice of several quiet areas, each decorated attractively with Afghan artifacts and clusters of greenery. Under each glass-top table is a woven mat, and the entire look is simple but immaculate.
1992-03-21	Debit vs. Credit Cards: Pay Now, or Later	"A year ago, Susan Frankowski, a Reading, Pa., lawyer, applied for and received a Visa debit card from the Meridian Bank of Reading, where she has a checking account. ""I don't write half as many checks as I used to,"" she said. ""And it saves time in balancing my statement."" Previously, she said, she used credit cards to pay for many purchases."
1992-03-15	"DINING OUT;
A View on the Waterfront in Peekskill"	"CRYSTAL BAY doesn't just have a wonderful view of the water; the place presides over the waterfront like an imperial presence. Wooden walkways and decks evoke the piers of seaside resorts once clustered along south Atlantic strands; even through the dark of a midwinter night, we can call up midsummer and imagine the broad deck scattered with loungers awaiting their indoor tables, sipping cool drinks and admiring the sunset and the river. 

Once a Fleischmann distillery, this impressive and respectful factory reclamation houses the restaurant on its second floor (the National Maritime Historical Society is on the ground floor). A massive fireplace punctuates the dining room done in lovely honeyed shades of oak, and a ribbon of windows overlooks the river and the M.B.M. Marina. Imposing aged brick extends into half and full walls, straight and handsomely curved, the work reminiscent of an earlier time when such craftsmanship was both expected and respected. The memory is appropriate: passageways and a gallery display local artists' renditions of local history and fascinating old photographs, maps, prints and postcards of the construction of the Croton Dam and the men who built it (their names catalogued and posted on the wall). Crystal Bay is an ambitious undertaking carried off splendidly."
1992-03-15	An Italian Menu With Intriguing Spins	EVERY town deserves at least one really good Italian restaurant. Fortunately Avon now has Max A Mia. An offshoot of the popular Max on Main in Hartford, Max A Mia has converted a triangular corner storefront into a lively, inviting dining space with enlarged, tinted photographs of Italian scenes. One mustard-color wall is lined with booths; the opposite brick wall, behind the bar area, has a wood-burning pizza oven and is decorated with strands of garlic bulbs and wooden piels used for removing pizza from the oven. Despite a no-reservations policy (except for six or more), with consequent inconvenience for potential customers, the staff is a welcoming one, and service, once we were seated, was brisk and helpful.
1992-03-08	"DINING OUT;
Italian Vitality and Freshness in Armonk"	"ALTHOUGH it is now firmly established on Armonk's Main Street, La Scala exudes a vitality and spontaneity that make it seem fresh and new. Responsible for turning this unpretentious little restaurant into a winner would seem to be the teamwork of the owner and the chef. Salvatore Anastasi, the gracious owner, is usually on hand with a warm, solicitous welcome, ready to whisk away coats and to see that big slices of good bread piled high with a mixture of tomato, garlic, parsley and olive oil (a version of bruschetta) are served to every table. And the food is carefully prepared. The kitchen uses little salt and instead employs -- with delicious abandon where appropriate -- herbs and luscious hunks of sweet fresh garlic, which the Calabrian chef insists is ""good for the blood."" We don't need a reason.

That generosity of ingredients brought to particular perfection a dish of homemade gnocchi and broccoli, the excellent potato dumpling rolled and cut home style. Also satisfyingly chewy, perciatelli filetto di pomodoro arrived with a simple but superb sauce of tomatoes, onion, garlic and hunks of pancetta. Both dishes were hard acts to follow and stole some of the thunder from, under other circumstances, a more than adequate capellini primavera, topped with lovely vegetables, and fettuccine Alfredo, a triumph, the creamy cheese sauce merely gilding, not drowning, the flat noodles. Only linguine puttanesca fell short of expectations, heavy tomato sauce an intrusive addition."
1992-03-03	Lintas Creative Chief Rising To Mastercard's Challenge	SINCE arriving at Lintas New York 14 months ago to become executive creative director, Tony DeGregorio has supervised the introduction of reformulated advertising for Diet Coke, as well as Lintas's first work for a new client, Maybelline. And he helped the shop land the Bacardi Imports account after a lengthy and competitive review. Now, Mr. DeGregorio confronts his most challenging task to date, defending Lintas's estimated $60 million Mastercard International account in a long-expected review announced last week.
1992-03-03	BUSINESS DIGEST	Companies Kaye, Scholer and its former managing partner were sued by the U.S. for their role in representing Charles Keating. The suit is the largest ever brought against an adviser to a failed saving institution by the Government, which also moved to freeze the New York law firm's assets. [ Page A1. ] Until his affiliation with Keating and Lincoln Savings, Peter M. Fishbein led a very charmed legal career as head of Kaye, Scholer.

1992-03-02	American Express Gold For Mexico	Betting on free trade in North America and a boom in the consumer credit market here, the American Express Company and Mexico's largest bank have joined in a new partnership to provide financial services in Mexico. With considerable fanfare, American Express and Banco Nacional de Mexico S.A. on Friday announced a relatively modest first venture: the issuance through Banamex, as the bank is known, of American Express gold cards.
1992-03-01	A Passage to Indian Food in New London	INDIAN restaurants are still so rare in Connecticut that those who love the cuisine are willing to travel miles to try a new one. And Raj Mahal, a short distance from Interstate 95 in New London, is the kind of place (in quality and price) for which devotees may be willing to make such a journey. From the outside Raj Mahal is simply a modest storefront. Inside, the limited space has been made into two small dining areas separated by a divider with plants blossoming along the top. Cream-color walls are hung with a few pictures of India. Despite signs of undercapitalization, the tables look cheerful, with burgundy over tan cloths, burgundy cloth napkins to match and a red rose on each table.
1992-02-27	Mastercard Account Is Under Review	After months of speculation that it would put its estimated $60 million account into review, Mastercard International notified Lintas New York, its agency since 1987, that a review was forthcoming. The announcement was made on Tuesday by Peter Dimsey, president of Mastercard's United States operation, who said the company was seeking to broaden its creative options. Lintas accepted an invitation to take part in the review. The remaining contenders will be selected by Mastercard with the assistance of Morgan Anderson & Company, a consulting firm in New York.
1992-02-23	"DINING OUT;
Up-to-Date Fare in an Unexpected Place"	"THE industrial neighborhood surrounding the Riverfront Cafe in Harrison is so gritty that there ought to be a sign out on the road saying, ""Come on in -- the food's really good.""

Who would expect to find up-to-date, satisfying fare in a little bistro tucked among warehouses and a truck depot? Dishes like grilled vegetables and prosciutto glossed with roasted garlic sauce, tasty pastas and rosy venison medallions with the chef's venison sausage are not exactly truck-stop fare.  Nor are desserts like creme caramel laced with coffee, or flourless chocolate cake in a puddle of champagne sabayon."
1992-02-16	"DINING OUT;
Congenial, Homey Comfort in Mt. Kisco"	"THIS congenial destination, in a rambling little house set back from busy Lexington Avenue, has been a popular neighborhood eating spot and watering hole from its inception 10 years ago. It is comfortable and pretty in a homey way, cluttered with this and that -- the whole kit and caboodle. Alternating with cream walls, Ralph Lauren wallpaper, a street-scene mural of simpler days and many engaging, framed 19th- and early-20th-century graphics supply eye-catching details.

In a way, the place is obvious; as is the menu listing such items as Cajun sea scallops, potato skins, Buffalo chicken wings and steaks. But in its attractive presentations, the use of nuts to enhance texture, a generous supply of dewy vegetables, subtle spicing and marination, Kit 'n' Caboodle manages to deliver the unexpected often enough to sustain the interest of regular diners."
1992-02-16	Can There Ever Be Too Much Italian Food?	FAIRFIELD COUNTY may be awash in a tidal wave of Italian restaurant openings, but you'll hear nary a complaint from us -- not when they're the quality of Terra. The Greenwich restaurant's very name suggests what it is about: honest food of the earth, natural and real, expertly prepared in a straightforward way. Esthetically, Terra is a gem. A small, narrow storefront now has a touch of Tuscany, with pale apricot walls, pin-spot lighting and a terrazzo floor. In front, rounded arches and charming lunettes are painted with delicate scenes; in the rear are a natural wood ceiling, bar and wood-fired oven that create an even more casual mood.
1992-02-13	Big Profits From Risky Customers	"Mail-order shopping is largely a pursuit of the affluent, with companies like J. Peterman offering a $33 leather-brimmed baseball hat described as a ""treasure."" But the Fingerhut Companies is making large profits pursuing customers that most cataloguers would not waste postage on. In fact, Fingerhut has grown into the nation's fourth-largest mail-order company by serving customers who on average have a household income of $24,000, about $5,000 less than the national average."
1992-02-09	Business Diary	ECONOMY Mr. Bush on Health Care
1992-02-08	Please Don't Squeeze the Bar Code, Sir	President Bush, something of a stranger at the local A.&P., was recently amazed by a trade-show exhibit of modern supermarket technology, with its laser scanners and electronically identifiable soup cans. But the latest wrinkle in grocery buying might positively baffle the Consumer in Chief: shopperless supermarkets. A new kind of telephone system, called Scanfone, lets harried shoppers buy groceries at home from a catalogue and have the purchases delivered at convenient times. The catalogue lists the products and gives their bar codes, the identification stripes that most packaged goods now carry. The phone has a light pen that reads the codes.
1992-02-07	Down-to-Earth Dining? Try Brooklyn	OF the 10,000 or so sit-down restaurants peppered through the neighborhoods of New York City, few achieve world-class greatness. Many just charge as if they do. Many more are fast-food joints that squeeze out prefabricated dishes. But there are exceptions. This column is intended to celebrate those working stiffs of the restaurant world where, for $25 and under, a person can eat lavishly, not stinting on appetizers, main courses or desserts. Take the Greene Avenue Grill. In the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, this intimate spot nourishes the film makers, musicians, artists and young professionals who are giving new life to this patch of battered brownstones adjacent to Fort Greene Park. Louis Armstrong beams down from one white wall of the simple, angular main room; Miles Davis glowers from another. But it is the food that gives the place its beat.
1992-02-06	Optima Credit Card to Charge Higher Rates to Riskier Holders	The American Express Company is trying to revive the fortunes of its Optima credit card by reducing interest rates for its best customers and raising rates for those most likely to become delinquent or to default. The strategy comes after American Express discovered that its four-year-old Optima operation had lost about $150 million in 1991. The change is similar to what other credit card issuers have done to make more distinctions between their best customers and others.
1992-02-04	American Express Plan To Get Cash	Hoping to build up its financial cushion, the American Express Company announced yesterday that it planned to sell to the public a minority stake in its profitable information-services company. American Express said it would sell up to 45 percent of its Information Services Corporation in an initial public offering. The company did not say how much the offering would raise, although analysts estimated it could be up to $800 million.
1992-02-02	A Cheerful New Spot in Ridgefield	"THE name Sam's Grill may evoke images of a smoky bar a la Bogart, Bergman and ""Casablanca,"" but nothing could be further from the reality of this cheerful, inviting new restaurant in Ridgefield. Sam's Grill is in the cozy, romantic premises formerly occupied by a French restaurant called Le Coq Hardi. The credo of Sam's Grill seems to be serving moderately priced light dishes, simply prepared without rich and heavy saucing, in a warm and casual atmosphere. Even the cellar setting has been lightened. The stone walls and post-and-beam construction have been painted white, other walls have salmon-patterned paper, and there is a profusion of live plants and artful silk flower arrangements."
1992-02-02	State Moves Against '900' Number Schemes	"WHEN Sherry Haggerty of Newton received a notice in the mail telling her that she had been pre-approved for a gold credit card, she was initially somewhat skeptical. The presence of the familiar Visa and Mastercard logos, however, quelled her skepticism. She called the ""900"" telephone number printed on the notice. A short time later, she received a catalogue and a gold plastic card. ""The gold card was nothing like a Visa or Mastercard,"" Ms. Haggerty said. In fact, she said, the card was good only for ordering merchandise from the catalogue itself. And even though she ordered nothing, Ms. Haggerty was nevertheless charged for the card."
1992-01-31	Restaurants	Chelsea Central Larry McIntyre, the owner of Chelsea Central on 10th Avenue, must sometimes feel like the coach of a successful minor-league baseball team: the better his team, the greater the chance his best slugger will be drafted up to the big leagues. Of course, in the restaurant game the cleanup hitter is the chef, and in the last five years Mr. McIntyre has seen some prize players come and go. In 1987, Richard Moonan was recruited to create a refined American menu; he later moved to the River Cafe in Brooklyn. Then came Tom Valenti, another ace with American cuisine, who left for Alison on Dominick Street in SoHo. After him came Stephen Meyers from Le Bernardin and the Sign of the Dove. He stayed until last July, when he was tapped by the Century Cafe in midtown Manhattan. The current chef, Paul Zweben, who was a sous-chef at the River Cafe, follows an impressive roster of alumni. Chelsea Central has a turn-of-the-century charm, with its long mahogany bar, stamped tin ceiling, tile floor, stained glass trim, Art Deco posters and cafe tables with bentwood chairs. Tulip sconces diffuse soft light on the brick walls and white napery. It's the kind of place you can go wearing anything from blue jeans to a business suit and feel comfortable. Mr. Zweben's menu combines traditional American fare and colorful contemporary creations, plus a couple of curve balls like duck confit egg rolls. These crisp, light cylinders hold rich duck confit, scallions and ginger bound with a chicken mousse, all are moistened with a rice-wine vinaigrette. Iced Pine Island oysters are an enticing way to start, as is the sweet-tinged onion soup. Hummus, the Middle Eastern chickpea puree, is prepared here with white beans and garlic. While the flavor is pleasing, this unnecessary modification leaves the puree mushy like potatoes, rather than faintly grainy as with chickpeas. Little cornmeal-encrusted crab cakes are all crust and little crab. But the garnishes -- salsa made of corn, fennel and basil, and basil-tomato oil -- are delicious. Chelsea Central has a very well-rounded wine selection, with prices that match the food tab. Among whites, you would do well with the sharp, clean 1989 sauvignon blanc from Silverado Vineyards ($19), or the 1990 Muscadet from Domaine de l'Alouette ($16). Two of the many reds to consider are a 1989 Dolcetto d'Alba Cantina del Glicine ($20) and the 1988 petite sirah from Guenoc Vineyards ($20). The restaurant's servers are casual but attentive. The pace of a meal here is agreeable, too, never rushed or laggard. Chelsea Central is the sort of pub environment in which you would want to have a steaming shepherd's pie. My experiences with it were mixed. On a first sampling, it was a rough, clumsy assembly of lamb chunks and carrots in a lackluster sauce. A fellow diner ordered it on a second visit, against my advice. This time it was totally different, with tender slices of lamb and carrots in a rich, well-seasoned lamb stock and sealed with chive-flecked mashed potatoes. A third sampling (I'm tenacious when it comes to shepherd's pie) also was superior. Take your chances. One of the most consistently good dishes is grilled duck breast and buttery confit of the legs, with a cabernet sauvignon sauce. A meaty sauteed pork chop comes with tasty red-pepper polenta, zucchini and sauteed escarole, while a nicely blackened Black Angus steak that is wonderfully beefy is served with golden-brown spatzle and spinach. Red snapper is prepared several ways; in one, the fillet is seared until crisp and set over a bright mixture of bok choy, pickled ginger and portobello mushrooms. Fruitwood-grilled salmon is enhanced with corn, black beans and potato pancakes. Some desserts sound as if they were ordered for a birthday party at summer camp. Peanut butter chocolate pie with chocolate sauce is recommended only for those who still have a peanut-butter-and-jelly habit. Pumpkin ice cream in a chocolate coating is a diverting combination, and cappuccino creme brulee (I've had three at various restaurants in the last month, which makes it as a trend) is harder to swallow conceptually than literally. The creamy coffee flavor is not bad at all. Rounding it out are two winners: pear and apple crisp with vanilla ice cream, and a fudgelike flourless chocolate cake with creme anglaise. One needs a score card to keep track of chefs at Chelsea Central. But as long as Mr. Zweben is in control, one can be assured of solid American fare that is thoughtfully conceived and prepared with generosity of spirit. Indochine When Indochine was last reviewed, in 1988, I noted that at this Southeast Asian hot spot in Greenwich Village one could expect a colorful downtown crowd, long waits for tables, indifferent service and provocative food. Recent visits require some modification: few crowds, no wait for tables, languid service and still-invigorating food. Despite its attitude problem, Indochine remains the best bet for authentic and lightsome Vietnamese and Cambodian cooking. Like so many restaurants that have had long, successful runs, Indochine has let down its guard. No one appears to be in charge of the dining room, certainly not the sullen hostess dressed in black who spent most of the evening leaning against the bar. Servers were only slightly more attentive. The long rectangular room has a tentative tropical theme, with palm fronds painted on the walls, greenery scattered here and there, dark green banquettes and white tablecloths. Now that the dining room is not crowded -- at least not on the January evenings I was there -- noise is not a major concern. Those who have been to Indochine in the last two, four or six years will recognize most dishes on the menu. It rarely changes, which must be monotonous for repeat customers with inquisitive palates. One standard that remains compelling is the sweet-and-sour shrimp in a sweet pineapple-and-tomato broth seasoned with tamarind. This multi-dimensional creation strikes first with the sweetness of the pineapple, then yields to the sour elements, finally leaving the palate with an earthy tamarind sensation. Another is fillet of gray sole, steamed in a banana leaf with sweet coconut milk and citric lemon grass. Banh cuon are steamed Vietnamese ravioli, three big ones, stuffed with minced chicken, black mushrooms and bean sprouts, then garnished with more chicken and bean sprouts. The ravioli are not particularly tasty by themselves, but they come alive when dipped in nuoc cham, the Vietnamese condiment made with salted anchovies and vinegar. A light, satisfying starter is a simple salad of chopped chicken breast, cabbage and basil with a dressing of fermented fish sauce, sugar, lime juice and sweet pepper. Everyone at my table attacked the sprightly little shrimp-filled dumplings that are wrapped in mint and lettuce leaves, then dipped in a sweet sauce. The shrimp have some fire in them that is tamed by the soothing mint. In contrast, rouleaux de printemps, or spring rolls, are a cool combination of rice paper rolled around vermicelli, bean sprouts, and mint with a peanut sauce for dipping. A house special for many years has been the deep-fried boned chicken wings stuffed with vermicelli, bean sprouts, carrots, lemon grass, galangal (in the ginger family) and diced chicken. The texture is delightful, but the stuffing could use more seasoning. Once again a dipping sauce came to the rescue. Another special is terrific roast duck, the meat juicy and the skin brittle, in an assertive ginger sauce. Ginger also brightens cubes of grilled chicken breast sprinkled with sesame seeds. It was difficult to detect any lemon grass in the sweet little pork spare ribs, but the house rice with it, studded with peas and shrimp, was hard to stop eating. Indochine has a small, moderately priced wine selection that marries well with this complex food. Prices are right, too. The Vietnamese are not big dessert-eaters, although they do make some sweet fruit puddings and soups. I doubt that one would find lemon tart and hazelnut mousse cake on a Vietnamese table. Verisimilitude aside, Indochine's lemon tart is better than average, and its mousse cake is outstanding. Fruit sorbets and ice creams are well made, too. It is not so easy to recommend Indochine these days. Those who enjoy a lively and affable setting might well be put off by the somber staff; on the other hand, diners who care primarily about the food might love it. For now, it gets the benefit of the doubt, and the hope that the service shapes up. Chelsea Central ** 227 10th Avenue, at 23d Street, Manhattan, (212) 620-0230.

1992-01-25	White Collars and Mortarboards Are No Shield in This Recession	The recession loitering in the region for three years now has been paying surprise visits to the homes of many people who had always thought that blue-chip educations and white-collar jobs made them immune to cutbacks and unemployment. For these people, the economics of the slump have brought home a hard truth: recessions that used to spell trouble mostly for factory workers are now also disrupting the lives of the educated and the professional elite.

After a bitter period of losses, layoffs, cost cutting and slower growth in many American markets, Citicorp is hoping that rapid growth and high profits overseas will enable it to rebuild its financial strength and stature.

Italian Food Teams Up With Organic"	"""WE'VE had to go more mainstream,"" said David Walters, the co-owner, about the change of name and the new Italian-oriented menu at the little Morris County restaurant he operates with David Silverthorne. What only a few days earlier had been an engaging health food restaurant, the Diamond Spring Organic Cafe, greeted the new year as Cafe Metro.

The owners, the cooks and the pleasantly simple setting in a Victorian house all remain the same.  But now offered alongside the eclectic vegetarian fare are dishes like insalata Metro and linguine puttanesca."
1992-01-08	Serving Workers on the Road With Data to Go	Just as cellular telephone technology vaulted car telephones from rare curiosities to mass-market products, a new generation of nationwide data networks is making it possible for both large and small companies to extend their office computer systems to employees on the road. Mastercard International plans to use such a network for wireless credit-card verification terminals at county fairs or merchants' sidewalk kiosks. Otis Elevator uses a mobile data network to dispatch repair technicians around the country from a single office in Connecticut and to receive back their reports. Another emerging group of converts to the mobile office: insurance claims adjusters, who shuttle between the scenes of accidents and disasters, trying to estimate the costs of repairing a car or replacing a roof.
1992-01-05	Tacos, Salsas and More for the Family	"SU CASA, a Mexican restaurant near Exit 55 of Interstate 95 in Branford, has had an 18-year run. Efficient and welcoming service, cozy dining areas decorated with Mexican artworks, and decently cooked, predictable food, all explain why. The menu isn't extensive but it touches all the familiar Tex-Mex bases. For a newcomer to Mexican food there is a concise, helpful description beneath each listing, sometimes with a comment. Macho Nachos are described, for example, as ""tortilla chips topped with lots of sauce, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions and melted cheese. Not for men only."""
1992-01-05	Getting Off to a Fast Start in Great Neck	THE six-week-old North Street Grill in Great Neck is the Island's hottest new restaurant. It has the look, ownership expertise and exciting menu that make it the last word in 1990's dining. The multi-level restaurant that has emerged on the site of the old Maude Craig's is a stunner. It is earthy, sturdy and southwestern, yet light, airy and modern.
1991-12-29	"DINING OUT;
Huge Portions of Robust Italian Food"	"ROBUST, well-prepared Italian dishes at non-larcenous prices coupled with friendly, professional service are what keep LuNello's packed. It's surely not the cramped dining room with a decor that could be called motel Art Deco, and an even snugger bar, that keeps them coming back to the converted pizza parlor in a commercial strip of Totowa's Union Boulevard.

But there's a success energy at the two-year-old Passaic County establishment, with table-hopping regulars greeting one another around the room. On weekends, there's often a crush at the bar since reservations are not accepted for small groups."
1991-12-29	A Bustling Bistro Turns 100% Italian	GOODBYE, Fabio's. Hello, Pomodoro. The Brazilian-Italian hybrid at 62 Stewart Avenue in Huntington Village is no more. In its place is a 100 percent Italian restaurant under the same ownership. Gone are the black beans and the white baby-grand piano, along with the parrots and the aquamarine-tropical decor. Now, the red, white and green of the Italian flag color Pomodoro Ristorante Italiano, leaving no doubt about this newcomer's lineage. Helping make a bold Italian statement are the center-stage antipasto display, the red-and-white checked tablecloths, murals of Italy and wall hangings depicting bountiful Italian feasts.
1991-12-23	American Express Cuts Off Retailer	In the latest flare-up over the fees it charges businesses that accept its charge card, the American Express Company has cut its ties with Laura Ashley Holdings P.L.C., after the retailer tried to discourage customers from using the card. American Express learned of Laura Ashley's effort last weekend, when an American Express executive was buying Christmas presents at a Laura Ashley store in the New York area. When the executive tried to pay for the gifts with an American Express card, the sales clerk tried to persuade her to use another card.
1991-12-22	Dean Witter, Proving Itself at Retail	DEAN WITTER seemed to be left behind by the hectic 80's. While the company sought to control costs, many of its competitors spent freely. While it tended to individual investors, others courted giant institutional customers. But now, Dean Witter executives are smiling. So are executives at the parent, Sears, Roebuck and Company, to which Dean Witter contributed profits of $260 million in the first three quarters of this year, a robust 48 percent above year-earlier totals.
1991-12-22	Country French Inn Reopens to Italian Fare	FANS of good food feel pangs of sadness on learning that a good restaurant has departed. Such was our feeling when L'Hotellerie des Bois closed its doors in West Redding. We were not terribly reassured to learn that a casual Italian restaurant had taken over the space across from the West Redding railroad station. After all, it was created in the style of a French country inn, with white lace curtains at the glass doors of the small dining room, terra cotta floor, a low-beamed ceiling and a fireplace. We wondered what would happen to this beautiful, romantic-looking place.
1991-12-22	When Those Desserts Become Spoilers	RESTAURANTS have personalities, and Sherry's Place in Babylon is a rugged individualist. This one-of-a-kind spot defies easy labeling. One diner at our table tried to peg it as a sprouts-and-seeds place. In fact, both are found in the house salad. Other health-food signposts are the brown rice, which comes with all entrees; the full-page sushi menu, and the nonalcoholic beers and wines, which are the strongest brews offered. To avoid confusion, a second Sherry's Place, also in Babylon, is indeed a health-food store.
1991-12-15	Where 'Inventive' Gets New Meaning	"DINING OUT

IT helps to be both well rested and ravenous before tackling a meal at Mumfords', a convivial cafe-restaurant in the Monmouth County town of Long Branch.

First of all, reservations are accepted only for large groups in the casually attractive second-floor restaurant, and it is so popular that during the summer there can be as much as a two-hour wait in the downstairs holding pen for a table. Off season is the time to come."
1991-12-13	Robert W. Brooks, Bank Executive, 56	Robert W. Brooks, a managing director at Chemical Bank, died Tuesday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 56 years old and lived in Chatham, N.J. He died of Hodgkin's disease, said Charles Salmans, a spokesman for the bank.
1991-12-08	Yes, Yet Another New Italian Place!	AFTER months of finding that the only new restaurants to review were Italian, we were ready to head for the nearest barbecue house for a change of pace. But discovering Spazzi, a self-styled trattoria in a small shopping complex called the Brick Walk in Fairfield, stopped us. At first we were overwhelmed by the noise and hyperactivity -- staff dashing here and there, patrons waiting for tables, cooks working full throttle at the brick oven and wood-fired grill on full display in the open kitchen, the intrusive beat of taped music. To add to the confusion, multiple television screens blinked incessantly at the rear bar. But once seated, we were charmed by the wit of the minimal decor, with trompe l'oeil renderings of Italian ruins and Roman columns, and by the menu, which was intriguing.
1991-12-04	Visa to Open Card System	Visa USA announced plans on Monday to change its membership rules to make it easier for companies other than banks, like department stores, to issue Visa cards. Although Visa, the leading general-purpose credit card company, has not announced the specific rules governing such companies, it said that next week it would end a 13- month moratorium on accepting new members owned by companies that are not banks.
1991-12-03	Visa Widens Right to Offer Credit Card	Visa USA announced plans yesterday to change its membership rules to make it easier for companies other than banks, like department stores, to issue Visa cards. Although Visa, the leading general-purpose credit card company, has not announced the specific rules governing such companies, it said it would end a 13-month moratorium next week on accepting new members owned by companies that are not banks. The move by Visa also makes it more competitive with Mastercard, which has been gaining market share because it has been more willing to allow non-banking companies to join its system.
1991-12-01	"DINING OUT;
Authentic Renditions of Turkish Cuisine"	"IT'S easy to ignore the drab neighborhood when the reward is authentic renditions of Turkey's fragrant fare in a smartly spruced- up little storefront. For even the unadventurous diner, there are enough simple grilled dishes at the Turkish Kitchen to comprise a likable meal. 

The restaurant, which is in the Hudson County town of Weehawken, has been open for only six months, and yet it is already drawing a few aficionados from Manhattan. They appreciate not only its proximity to the Lincoln Tunnel but also, no doubt, the bargain menu prices and slightly bohemian ambience."
1991-12-01	11 Kinds of Pizza in Cheerful Atmosphere	A NEW restaurant, the Bricks, has opened in Norwalk -- and, surprise, it's Italian. As far as we know, no law has been passed to prohibit restaurateurs from opening anything but Italian establishments, but there has been many a sip of chianti since we have seen any other kind of ethnic restaurant opening its doors. You can tell what the Bricks is about the minute you enter. In one corner of the dining room a brick pizza oven spouts flames from its wood fire; in front of it, behind a counter, three pizza bakers are tossing, catching and stretching dough. White walls with hunter green trim; natural wood floors, chairs and tables, and green plants atop the room divider all add to the light, cheerful family atmosphere (as does the high decibel level). As seating is on a first-come, first-served basis, there is a small bar in the rear, where diners can have a drink (and nibble some good garlic-marinated olives) while they wait.
1991-11-29	Restaurants	The bistro stampede in New York City continues unabated. It's only natural, really, since this homespun, unaffected genre offers just what cash- starved diners want today. Wholesome food at a good price in a familiar environment. It's a great time to be in the checkered tablecloth business. In many ways, Quatorze has been a paradigm since it opened in 1984 on West 14th Street along a strip of bodegas, open-air clothing emporiums and bilingual driving schools. The owners, Peter Meltzer and Mark DiGiulio, often visit France and bring back ideas to fine-tune their restaurant. The setting, like the food, is simple and unstudied.
1991-11-24	Making a Difference; The 9.5% Credit Card Bank	A week or so ago, big banks -- and Wall Street -- screamed in pain and panic when the Senate considered putting a 14 percent cap on credit card interest rates. How's a bank supposed to make a living, much less a profit, without charging the more typical 18, 19, 20 percent? Simple, says Robert C. Dill, executive vice president and marketing director of Simmons First National Bank of Pine Bluff, Ark., one of the banks that regularly appears at the top of lists of low-interest cards.
1991-11-24	High Credit Card Rates: A Luxurious Necessity?	AS a matter of principle, Ralph Nader has no credit cards. He says they encourage reckless spending, raise prices and permit the creation of data banks that could lead to invasion of privacy. He may be right. But few other people would accept the inconvenience of life without plastic. For the person with no credit cards, it is difficult if not impossible to rent a car, reserve tickets to the theater or sports events, travel without a dangerous wad of cash or engage in many other routine activities of modern society. Mr. Nader, in fact, caused a ruckus in a Princeton, N.J., hotel last week when he arrived to check in and could not produce a credit card.
1991-11-24	Artful Simplicity, Tuscan-Inn Style	FAIRFIELD COUNTY is doubly blessed with the opening within weeks of each other of two excellent Italian restaurants. (Bella Luna, in Greenwich, was reviewed here Oct. 3.) Now, Sole e Luna has opened in Westport. To add to the pleasure, each has created the warm, welcoming atmosphere of a Tuscan farmhouse or inn. Sole e Luna, which calls itself a ristorante Toscano, sets the tone with a whimsically decorated oven, visible through a large window as you enter. To spark one's appetite, a table of vegetable dishes (a tavola fredda or cold table) is at the entrance to the large dining room. Natural wood floors, post-and-beam construction, rush-bottom chairs and white walls add to the Tuscan inn look. Sole e Luna's hallmarks are freshness and simplicity, not lavish saucing or ornately complex creations. The best dishes are the most straightforward. For instance, as a starter nothing surpassed portobello alla griglia, a fresh, meaty grilled portobello mushroom that covered the entire plate was drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil. It sufficed -- exquisitely. A grilled fillet of pearly white swordfish (spada griglia alla benedetta) with garlic and sage, was accompanied by three perfect asparagus spears. Again, the union of first-rate ingredients prepared with expert simplicity triumphed. The triumph continued with the tavola fredda, eight vegetables served at room temperature: paper-thin slices of pleasingly charred eggplant, grill-brushed cauliflower, red and yellow peppers, olives scented with bay leaf, rosemary and garlic, fire-etched onion wedges, white beans, marinated beet and elegant whole green beans with slivers of red pepper.
1991-11-23	Credit Cards: Variable Rates Don't Always Help	Congressional efforts to cap interest rates on credit cards have ground to a halt amid fears that banks might revoke millions of credit cards and drive the economy deeper into recession. Consumers who want good deals -- low interest rates and low annual fees (or none at all) -- will have to continue shopping around. Some will no doubt be attracted to variable-rate credit cards, which account for about 10 percent of all cards issued, according to Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer advocacy group in Herndon, Va.
1991-11-22	Restaurants	Add to the community of dining spots that call themselves Mediterranean -- that sunny amalgam of Greek, southern Italian and North African cuisines -- the East Side spot Mimosa. Unlike many similar restaurants, Mimosa has been hotter than harissa since opening day in September, largely because of the accomplished young chef, Marilyn Frobuccino. Ms. Frobuccino most recently stoked the campfires at Arizona 206, another popular establishment that packs them in daily. The move to Mimosa allows her the freedom to expand beyond a limited regional cuisine. Like a child set loose for summer vacation, Ms. Frobuccino sometimes lets her ebullience get the better of her common sense. More often than not, though, her creations sparkle with the vigorous Mediterranean flavors of olives, rosemary, garlic and tomatoes.
1991-11-20	The Senate's Credit Card Blunder	The Senate's hasty reaction to President Bush's call for lower interest on credit cards is a model of how not to govern. The President's exhortation was harmless jawboning. But the Senate's overwhelming approval of an interest-rate cap barely 24 hours later was populist folly. Price controls, whether on goods or the cost of credit, are a bad idea except in a genuine emergency. They distort economic activity, and the eventual process of decontrol is always painful. Nonetheless, with no public hearings and only 30 minutes of floor discussion, 73 senators agreed with Senator Alfonse D'Amato's rash proposal to chop most credit card rates immediately.
1991-11-19	New Mastercard Post To Experienced Banker	Mastercard International Inc. said yesterday that it had named William T. Sandalls, vice chairman and chief financial officer of Bay Banks Inc., Boston, to the new position of chief operating officer. The company, which said that Mr. Sandalls would join Mastercard in December, added that he would have responsibility for the company's global payment system and would report directly to Alex W. Hart, the company's president and chief executive.
1991-11-19	Banks Uneasy at Focus on Credit Cards	The debate in Congress that led to consideration of a cap on credit card interest rates subsided yesterday, but it turned an unwelcome spotlight on one of the banking industry's richest businesses at a time when the industry can least afford the attention. As many of the nation's largest banks struggle with losses from commercial real estate loans, the credit card business was one of the industry's few bright spots. It accounted for a quarter of all bank profits and generated returns that have been double the amount banks strive to earn on their loans.
1991-11-17	New Small-Town Place Has Big-City Look	THE latest beachhead of the tidal wave of Italian restaurants is Prezzo (the name means prize in Italian), a smart-looking place with a big-city look, in little New Canaan. Along one pale-pink entrance wall is a row of black sconces, reminiscent of the torches illuminating a castle wall. Greeting your eyes is the room's major decorative object, an upended black Ducati motorcycle (shades of the Hard Rock Cafe), along with handsome pinpoint lights over each table. Almost everything else has a shiny black patent-leather look -- chairs, beveled-edge tables and a black-and-white tile floor. A dark glass wall separates the dining area from a small, similarly decorated bar. The hard-edged look is matched by a hard-edged noise level. While Prezzo's look promises sophisticated dining, the reality is more casual. The menu and long business hours invite grazing with many rewarding choices, including a number of pizza combinations. This may explain why the place is hopping with families and young people.
1991-11-15	Credit Card Rate Caps Draw Fire	Bankers warned yesterday that a measure approved by the Senate to limit credit card interest rates to 14 percent would bring a sharp reduction in the availability of credit cards that would disrupt the economy. Although the credit card business has been highly lucrative for several years, the bankers said the profit margin was not so great that they could afford to cut interest rates to 14 percent from the current average of 18 percent or 19 percent and still earn a profit.
1991-11-14	An Ethnic Push In Credit Cards	A Connecticut bank and a Spanish-language television network are embarking on a nationwide effort to market credit cards to Hispanic customers. People's Bank, based in Bridgeport, began offering the cards today through a special toll-free number, and will make applications and monthly statements available in Spanish and English.
1991-11-10	"DINING OUT;
Spotlight on Pasta Dishes in Larchmont"	"NOW in its 14th year, La Riserva, like some wines, seems to improve with age. It wouldn't be surprising to come across in grander dining rooms and at higher prices dishes of the quality now served here. To find this food offered in modest surroundings and at reasonable cost certainly makes La Riserva a restaurant for the 90's. Eating well in a recession is the best revenge, especially when one can do it within a budget. 

Whether ordered for a first course or for an entree, La Riserva's pasta dishes are a must. We haven't met a pasta here we haven't liked. Heading the list of farinaceous accomplishments was a simple dish that, oddly enough, few places make properly -- linguine with clam sauce. No soupy liquid dolloping over the rim of the pasta bowl here. Instead, chunky pieces of clam, huge slices of fresh garlic and a dusting of oregano mingled with linguine shimmering with sauce."
1991-11-10	New Haven Gets Second Thai Restaurant	A NEW restaurant called Cha-Da Thai has doubled New Haven's supply of Thai restaurants just by opening its doors. Considering the city's rich cultural diversity, it is no surprise to find another ethnic dining establishment in the city center, down the street from the Yale Art Gallery and Yale Repertory Theater. Anyone long acquainted with New Haven will immediately recognize Cha-Da Thai's cellar premises as the site of the Old Heidelberg, a landmark for several generations. The configuration remains much the same, with a bar (with a few tables) to the left of the entrance and the larger dining room on the right. At the entrance are several glittery, golden Siamese dance headdresses (known as cha-da, hence the restaurant name) used as wall decorations. Less festive are the black pressed-tin ceiling, plywood-panel walls painted gray-black, and cardinal-red plastic booths and banquettes, all of which are more reminiscent of an old-style Italian restaurant than a new Thai one.
1991-11-09	Guidepost; Last-Ditch Credit	For those with damaged credit or no credit history at all, a secured bank credit card may be a good idea. Consumers who may not qualify for an ordinary card -- those hurt by the recession, divorce, bankruptcy or layoffs -- can often get a secured Visa or Mastercard issued by a reputable bank. But the secured cards require a money deposit as collateral. The higher the deposit, the higher the credit limit. A secured credit card offers a chance to repair a credit history, or start one, since card behavior is reported to the major credit bureaus. For a list of issuers of secured credit cards, send $4 to Bankcard Holders of America, 560 Parkway, Herndon, Pa. 22070; telephone (703) 481-1110. Here are some pointers on secured cards. Minimum deposit: From $250 to $500, usually earning 4 percent to 5.25 percent interest. The deposit cannot be withdrawn while the card is held, and the money is kept on deposit for at least 45 days after the account is closed to allow all charges to clear. Finance charge: Depending on the bank, the rate will range from 19 percent to 22 percent. Annual fee: $25 to $35 Restrictions: Some banks require applicants to have a checking or savings account, with store and other accounts not seriously overdue, and bankruptcy disputes settled.

1991-11-08	American Express Demotes Ogilvy	"Ogilvy & Mather New York, which since 1962 has created such memorable advertising lines for American Express as ""Don't leave home without it"" and ""Membership has its privileges,"" yesterday lost the most prestigious part of that account to Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. in New York. The loss, which involves the creation and execution of advertising ideas for the green charge card, is an unexpected blow to Ogilvy New York and its parent, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. It was especially unwelcome news to their corporate parent in London, the financially pressed WPP Group, because American Express's annual ad spending on the green card totals $60 million."
1991-11-08	Restaurants	Montrachet It was an audacious move when Montrachet opened its doors in 1985 on a drab block south of Canal Street. It may be hard to imagine today, but back then fine restaurants in TriBeCa were as scarce as yacht clubs. Montrachet, owned by a former maitre d'hotel at La Grenouille in Manhattan, Drew Nieporent, began as an uptown restaurant that dared diners to venture into distant, darkest TriBeCa.
1991-11-03	"DINING OUT;
A Lively, Casual Place for Italian Food"	"CELLA LUNA, a contraction of the Italian for ""There's the moon,"" is the name of a lively and with-it new place on Hoboken's restaurant row. Although few of the dishes offered here are likely to send diners over the moon, the young-spirited atmosphere and moderate prices for generous portions can make for a diverting meal. The food is a cross between trendy Tuscan grills and the old red-sauce-on-everything school.

By the entrance is a small take-out section with pastas, vinegars and a handful of prepared dishes.  Behind that are a long bar and a wide, open dining room that resembles a European cafe-brasserie.  Unless you like overhearing your neighbors' conversation at the tight little tables in the bar, opt to sit in the dining room, preferably at a booth along the wall."
1991-11-03	A Taste for the Old West in Ridgefield	FANS of Hay Day, the produce and food market in Greenwich and Westport, will welcome a new branch in Ridgefield that has the added attraction of a restaurant called the Hay Day Cafe. As one-third of a complex that includes the Hay Day Country Farm Market and wine shop, the cafe resembles a turn-of-the-century Western hotel or train-station restaurant. High ceilings, potted palms and ficus, mottled wallpaper, lace curtains, wood floors and wainscoting plus bentwood chairs all recreate another time.
1991-11-03	THE CLASSICS REVISITED	"In Cooking, as in art and music, new is a dubious term. From the time humans learned to harness fire and held the first barbecue, virtually everything in cooking has been derivative. The best of today's brash young chefs, who dazzle the public with creations of astounding colors, textures and flavors, are invariably nourished by the roots of classical cuisine. ""We all read the classic books and start that way,"" says Alfred Portale, the highly acclaimed American-born chef of Gotham Bar and Grill in Manhattan. ""Personally, I am much more confident working from a traditional base."""
1991-10-26	Court Says Holders' States May Bar Charge-Card Fees	In a victory for holders of bank credit cards, a Federal court in Boston has ruled that banks issuing cards may not charge fees to customers in states that prohibit such fees, even if the fees are allowed under the laws of the state where the bank is based. States vary widely in the amount of fees they allow card issuers to charge for late payments, annual renewals and bounced checks. Bankers worry that the court ruling, if not overturned, will require them to adjust their prices for each state, or perhaps charge higher interest rates to compensate for fees they would no longer be allowed to collect.
1991-10-20	Cantonese, and Seafood Is a Specialty	REFLECTING the current desire for Cantonese fare in northern New Jersey, the former Chan's Garden in Livingston changed both its name and its focus last November. A new chef and three cooks, all Hong Kong-trained, were brought in to offer typical dishes like salt-baked chicken, seafood casseroles and steamed fish so fresh they are plucked live from tanks at the back of the bright open dining room. Outstanding dim sum, the bite-sized snacks, are also a specialty here on weekends. With a clean-lined new decor -- there's not a red lantern or dragon in sight -- and shaped-up service, North Sea Village is developing into one of the state's better Chinese restaurants. It is still owned by Hai-Kan Chan, of the family who also operates several other places including Chan's Garden in Dunellen. This Essex County restaurant is usually crowded with predominantly Chinese diners, often a reassuring sign both that the food is authentic and the prices not out of line. A three-course meal, not counting tip, tax and drinks (there's no liquor license), runs about $20.
1991-10-13	"DINING OUT;
Combining Flavors in an Afghan Setting"	"PAMIR, a two-year-old Afghan restaurant not far from the courthouse in Morristown, is an offshoot of the highly rated Pamir restaurant in New York, which is owned by the Bayat brothers. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only restaurant serving Afghan food in New Jersey. 

The simple storefront, which is owned and managed by Bassir Bayat, is on a block that includes a pizza parlor and an Indian restaurant. But the inside has been turned into a darkly exotic and perhaps even romantic meeting place."
1991-10-13	The Accent Is French, Mon Cheri, but . . .	A NEW French restaurant opening on Long Island is as rare as taking a dip in the Sound on Columbus Day. Neither is unknown, but both are infrequent enough to be events. Alouette took the plunge six weeks ago, when it opened in a tiny strip shopping center in Melville, specifically in quarters that previously housed La Sorbonne. This mere slip of a restaurant has a European family air. The owner-chef is in the kitchen, his wife is in the dining room, and on weekends their young son serves baskets of bread and glasses of water.
1991-10-11	Restaurants	"Sandro's In his leaner days, Sandro Fioriti might have been a soccer goalie, thrashing his towering frame in front of the net while deflecting leather cannonballs. Today his goal is less perilous but equally challenging: endearing New Yorkers to the multifaceted cuisine of his native region around Rome. Sandro's cadre of regular patrons offers proof that to some extent he is succeeding. Six-year-old Sandro's is not the kind of place you stumble upon. It is well concealed in the lobby of a high-rise apartment building on far East 59th Street, hard under the rumbling 59th Street Bridge. The big, casual dining room has a terra-cotta floor, palm trees and walls covered with framed posters of Italian food products. In such a neighborhood setting, captains in black tie seem incongruous. Upon being seated, you are presented a basket of terrific rosemary bread and ""dare you to eat just one"" sage-and-rosemary breadsticks. You will find that the wine list is strongest among Italian reds and whites, with a smattering of American labels, all on the moderate to high side. As we were discussing the wine and other matters, a captain barged in -- a common and annoying occurrence -- and recited his daily specials. When we wanted him, though, he was nowhere to be found. Another captain took the wine order and, a mere 20 minutes later, returned with it. Service in general was maladroit. The amiable Mr. Fioriti, though, was a most cordial host, stopping by every table to ask how the food turned out. We had no complaints about the ravioli filled with spinach and ricotta afloat in a beautifully balanced tomato-cream sauce, nor with the crisply fried artichokes, their dark golden leaves as brittle as puff pastry. The most compelling pasta dish was ravioli filled with sea urchin roe in a subtle tomato sauce studded with minced baby scallops. The oceanic sea urchin flavor burst through with every bite, and the light tomato sauce allowed it to shine. Quality pancetta and pecorino cheese were the foundation of a dish recommended by our captain, but the sauce was not integrated and the pasta was unevenly sauced. Spaghetti with clams on the half shell, a touch of tomato and herbs had a lusty shellfish flavor. Penne tossed with mild Italian sausage and cream was too timorous and lacking pepper for my taste. Among nonpasta starters, tender sauteed baby calamari with radicchio and tomato had everything going for it but flavor. Garlic or hot pepper would have helped. Ice cold carpaccio with olive oil and slices of Parmesan was hard to judge until it warmed on the plate. Then it was pleasing. Main courses here could sustain a pair of soccer players for the day. The roast suckling pig, a special, has a wonderful burnished skin concealing a thin layer of fat that adds moisture to the succulent meat. Equally good, if not better, was roasted baby lamb with a blackened crust and aroma of rosemary. One of the house favorites seems to be straccetti, grilled slices of beef that had been coated in olive oil, garlic and lemon. The vibrantly flavored meat is exceptionally tender. Fennel sausages with bitter broccoli were a fine combination, too. Butterflied Cornish hen, though, which can be savory when grilled, is fried here, which leaves it a bit heavy and bland. Among the seafood, salt cod cooked with potatoes, onions and tomatoes is firm and flavorful, reminiscent of traditional Portuguese recipes. Grilled swordfish, a special, was lustrous in a pool of white wine sauce scented with lemon and basil. It came with grilled endive. Only grouper braised with artichokes in a lemony wine sauce came out flat and one-dimensional. Another one of Mr. Fioriti's regional dishes is the polenta pudding with raspberry sauce. Surprisingly, the pudding was ultra-smooth with no grain detected. We later learned that a fine grade of polenta, almost flourlike, is used. Chocolate mousse cake is relatively light and intense with good bittersweet chocolate. And chocolate-dusted tartuffo is a special treat, as is granita of expresso (although granita of lemon is watered down). The first time we visited the restaurant, we were victims of Mr. Fioriti's puckish sense of humor. Toward the end of our main courses, he came by and insisted we try a platter of his favorite pasta. We groaned. As we finished our desserts, he came over holding a platter over his head. ""Pasta, Pasta!"" he announced as we all cringed. He then placed in front of us a platter of warm sugar cookies. Then came a selection of his homemade fruit grappas. Peach was our favorite. Sandro Fioriti is the type of host who makes sure you never leave hungry. And if you order wisely, you'll leave happy, too. Pamir Afghan food, which not long ago was as obscure as it was exotic, has moved into the dining mainstream in major cities. In New York City, for example, diners can choose from more than a half-dozen serious Afghan restaurants and many more living-room-size family cafes. Pamir, a congenial spot on Second Avenue in Manhattan, has always been one of my favorites. Afghan food is a melange of Middle Eastern cuisine with some spicy Indian accents tossed in. Lamb, chicken, rice and vegetables are the primary ingredients. Exotic herbs and spices give the food its allure. Pamir's dining room is a long, shadowy expanse with a bar at one end. Oriental rugs, assorted wall hangings and soft Eastern music contribute to its mysterious feeling. Candlelit tables are tightly arranged to accommodate the enthusiastic nightly crowds. Over the course of three visits, I found that service is not as sharp as it used to be. Orders are occasionally confused and servers are not always as diligent about getting drinks, bread, water and the like. The menu rarely changes, so it takes only one visit to become familiar with the specialties. Starters include sambosa goushti, triangles of greaseless fried pastry stuffed with a mixture of ground beef and chickpeas redolent of cinnamon and cumin; bulanee gandana, thin, blistered turnovers filled with scallions and herbs that are eaten with a tart yogurt sauce; bulanee kachalou, another turnover, stuffed with mashed potatoes, onions and spices, and aushak, crisp flat scallion-filled raviolis under a lovely yogurt sauce with ground meat and mint. All of the turnovers go well with some fiery cumin and coriander sauce. Beer is probably the most suitable beverage with this tangy food, although certain full-bodied red wines from the perfunctory list might stand up to the spices. Oddly enough, Pamir has a menu of tropical cocktails. The barman makes a mean margarita, although I wouldn't try it with a spicy yogurt sauce. Two popular main-course dishes are badenjan chalaw, a spicy mixture of cubed lamb, eggplant, tomatoes and onions, and sabsi-chalaw, lamb in a mellow spinach sauce flavored with onions and garlic. A daily special was a winner, too: zardak chalaw, stewed lamb with carrots, onions, garlic and ginger. One of my favorites has always been a colorful creation called norange palaw, a circular mound of saffron rice laced with almonds, pistachios and thin strips of orange zest. Beneath the rice is an aromatic lamb stew that, when mixed with the rice, can yield a complex and subtle melange of flavors and textures. A recent sampling, however, was woefully unbalanced. The rice was overloaded with sweet orange zest and cloying with rosewater. Quabilli palaw, a similar lamb dish made with brown rice, almonds, pistachios, raisins and carrot strips instead of orange, was better balanced, but some of the lamb was mushy from overmarination. Among meat entrees, there is only one escape from lamb. Kabab-e-murgh features skewered marinated chicken cubes with vegetables. On two samplings, the chicken was dryish, ameliorated somewhat by the coriander dipping sauce. Side dishes to consider are sabsi, a puree of spinach with onions and assorted spices (ours arrived at room temperature); buranee kadu, sauteed chunks of pumpkin topped with yogurt and ground beef, and buranee badenjan, delicious sauteed eggplant with a garnish of the same yogurt meat sauce. Desserts take some getting used to. Firnee is a firm, semisweet pudding studded with almonds and pistachios. Baghlawa is a form of baklava, made with brittle layers of pastry and sweetened walnuts. Gosh-e-feel is the most exotic, a pizza-size piece of fried dough dusted with cardamon, pistachios and confectioners' sugar. While Pamir still has exotic (and economic) appeal, the lapses in service and food merit a reduction from two stars, which it received in 1987, to one star.

Stylish Little Menu With Modest Prices"	"CHEAP and cheerful is what the English call casual eating places like Out to Eat, with its moderate menu prices, friendly staff and plain-Jane storefront setting.  Since the watchword these days is value for the dining dollar, restaurants like this one on Boonton's hilly Main Street hold a good deal of appeal.

But what is unexpected is the generally well-prepared, up-to-date food that is whisked out of the little one-man kitchen out back."

1991-10-03	American Express Sets Reserve for Card Losses	With many of its once-affluent customers driven into bankruptcy by the recession, the American Express Company yesterday took its most striking action to date to protect its business from a ballooning number of defaults on its credit cards. The company said it was setting aside $265 million for the expected defaults and to pay for a reorganization of its flagship charge-card business, including the loss of 1,700 jobs.

1991-09-22	"DINING OUT;
Sister Restaurants Offer Pasta and Salad"	"WITH so many diners concerned about health and the food they eat, it seems good business for a restaurant to offer a menu listing little else but those dishes the public demands at the moment. These days the diet of choice includes, generally speaking, vegetable oils, carbohydrates, vegetables, seafood and, perhaps, a bit of chicken. The Primi Piatti restaurants plan to deliver the goods.

The menu (identical at both spots) consists of 9 salads, 9 individual pizzas and at least 18 pasta dishes. Full- or snack-size dishes invite mixing and matching. But a good idea has gone haywire. The restaurants are out of their depth, particularly in Scarsdale where inept management matched amateurish preparations (the food is somewhat better in Larchmont). These are fast-food productions that offered no threat to Italian restaurants serving the real McCoy at similar prices."
1991-09-22	"DINING OUT;
Northern Italian in a Casual Chic Setting"	"AFTER several years in a tiny storefront in nearby Little Silver, Cucina di Roma moved last winter into a warmly attractive new space just off Red Bank's main shopping street. With walls painted a deep melon color and dotted with paintings and art objects, a divider providing intimacy, and attractively set tables with fresh flowers and good-looking service plates, the restaurant now has a casual chic. 

But while the satisfying, mostly northern Italian food has traveled well, the service has not kept up with the Monmouth County restaurant's more ""uptown"" setting. A meal here can be an endurance contest, making one wish that the pretty millefleurs-patterned dining chairs had more padding in the seat to cushion the long, long pauses between courses. At both lunch and dinner recently, one waiter, who was literally dashing, tried to serve far too many tables in the main dining room."
1991-09-22	An Ambitious Menu Plus Funky Style	SWEET PEA'S in Shelton is a low-key, funky little restaurant with several good things going for it: a limited, inventive menu, daily specials written on wall blackboards, trained and upbeat servers, and an atmosphere that is simple and sprightly with an edge of wit. You have to have some humor to put a 1929 Glenwood gas stove in a room and dub it the Glenwood Room. Even the restaurant's name suggests an offbeat personality at work. Sweet Pea's has two storefront dining rooms, side by side and similar, with exposed brick walls, mismatched white chairs and hunter-green tablecloths under glass tops. The first room features a white piano as centerpiece, the second has the stove. There is nothing fancy about the decor, but it is serviceable and has a certain charm.

The reason is simple: pleasing and moderately priced pastas, salads and seafood in a congenial setting. It's no wonder there is a wait for tables -- usually a short one, though -- virtually every night. Contrapunto has not changed noticeably since the first time it was reviewed in 1984, in either strengths or weaknesses. The all-white, tightly assembled dining room with an open kitchen and spotlighted tables can be clamorous at times, but rarely overwhelming. The young servers keep on top of things with relative success, but don't expect refined service (table-cleaning, wine-pouring, knowing who gets what). You start with slabs of moist, chewy country bread with good olive oil for dipping and marinated black olives. The sourdough loaves make excellent crostini when toasted and heaped with a mixture of broccoli, roasted peppers, onions and sun-dried tomatoes. The kitchen knows how to dress a salad, too, something so many restaurants neglect. The arugula salad with radicchio and goat cheese is a sprightly example, as is the house salad with mixed organic greens, balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Spongy fresh mozzarella goes well with translucent sheets of prosciutto, olives and chives, although the combination needed more olive oil, and pepper. Salty dried ricotta is a snappy match for roasted red peppers and tomatoes. The a la minute cooking technique for pasta works with certain ingredients, particularly seafood, but occasionally the rushed method is insufficient to create a cohesive, flavorful sauce. For instance, the tagliatelle tossed with marinated olives, tomato, basil, crushed red peppers, garlic, Parmesan and olive oil was not at all integrated; you tasted only what you happened to be chewing. The same problem diminished the tagliarini forte, tossed with arugula, pancetta, tomatoes, jalapenos and Parmesan. Yet more dishes succeed than fail. One example is the tagliarini conga d'oro, with sweet peppers, zucchini, eggplant, tomato, lots of garlic and olive oil. One reason this worked is that all the ingredients were finely chopped and then cooked evenly and thoroughly. Other winners were rigatoni with a concentrated tomato sauce, tart dried ricotta, eggplant and basil; fettuccine aragosta, with lobster, sage and butter, and fusilli pollo, with moist pieces of chicken breast, carrots, radicchio, onions and Parmesan. Both non-pasta dishes I sampled excelled: a nicely browned broiled veal chop with roasted red potatoes and braised escarole, and a split, broiled Cornish hen with sliced garlic and a delicious broth of lemon juice, olive oil, white wine and butter. Contapunto's limited wine list could be better selected to match the prices of the food. Nine of 14 whites and eight of 12 reds are $25 or over. Desserts here have never been special in my experience; nor are they now. Blueberry crumb pie with vanilla ice cream was the best sampled. Chocolate spice cake was a bland Gibraltar devoid of spice, and instead of bitter-orange ice cream, we received coconut. When I pointed this out to the waiter, he replied: ""They all look alike back there. Probably somebody mixed them up."" He then walked away. Five minutes later, a dish of nondescript orange ice cream was plunked on our table by a waitress, with no apology, no explanation. Contrapunto continues to serve a high-profile function in this vibrant neighborhood. With just a little refinement, its reputation could soar beyond Bloomiesland. Arcadia It's not easy in these financially difficult times to charge $55 for a prix-fixe dinner, especially at a restaurant with a relatively small menu, a limited wine list, and a charming but not sumptuous setting. Yet Arcadia manages to fill the house nightly with well-heeled fans of the contemporary all-American cooking of Anne Rosenzweig, the chef and owner. And, it is interesting to note, the prix fixe has not changed since the restaurant was last reviewed, in 1988. The 40-seat main dining room is indeed enchanting, with its bucolic wraparound mural, soft peripheral lighting and comfortable banquettes. The bar area can be intimate at off hours, tumultuous when patrons are coming and going en masse. You can savor a bit of the waning summer with an appetizer of fresh tomato soup, ripe and concentrated, served with little sandwiches of goat cheese on warm brioche. Vichyssoise, though, was watery and tasteless. A salad of field greens was beautiful to look at but inadequately dressed, and Arcadian Caesar salad with arugula and brioche croutons suffered the same problem. A sublime starter is foie gras over slices of brioche toast with a white raisin chutney. Creme fraiche and caviar are scintillating, too, served with thick, moist corn cakes. Pasta appetizers change frequently, but the two that I sampled were unexciting: ribbon pasta with tomatoes, olives and basil desperately needed seasoning, especially salt, and fettuccine with buckwheat, greens and a compote of figs was so bullied by the buckwheat that I tasted nothing else. Arcadia's wine list features quality labels, some of them uncommon finds, but bargains are as rare as free parking outside the restaurant. Among the better deals in whites are the 1988 Schleret riesling, herbal and crisp ($28), and the fresh, tart Frog's Leap 1990 sauvignon blanc ($24). In reds, a 1988 Gigondas, Domaine du Gour de Chaule, is elegant and full of fruit ($25), as is the 1988 Bridgehampton merlot ($26). The waiters at Arcadia are sharper now than the last time the restaurant was reviewed. Even at peak hours, dinner moves at a comfortable, leisurely pace. The best main courses are the most straightforward ones. Roast boneless chicken, a special, had a thin, brittle skin and came with potato pancakes and delicious crinkly kale. Grilled duck breast was pink and flavorful, served with grilled slivers of sweet potatoes and well-seasoned spinach. One of Ms. Rosenzweig's signature dishes is called chimney-smoked lobster, in which smoked lobster meat is served in the shell, along with a tasty layered noodle cake and zucchini. The lobster, which appeared to be only about a one-pounder, was fresh and perfectly cooked. But to my mind it did not merit a $7 supplement to the $55 menu. A special one evening was seared tuna over a zesty mix of black beans, white beans, tomato and herbs. It was garnished with buckwheat-coated oysters, which could have been wrapped in burlap for all the oyster flavor that came through. Poached salmon, though, was nicely executed with a saffron beurre blanc and sugar snap peas. The whimsical soft-shell crab ""club"" is not really a sandwich, but rather a tower of small, deep-fried soft-shell crabs over a sprightly corn-and-tomato relish with crunchy fried plantains scattered around the plate. Another fish on the menu, sauteed breaded blackfish, was well cooked but bland. The first-rate desserts are as all-American as a George M. Cohan medley: warm peach crumble with blueberry ice cream; sweet ripe cherries with cherry-almond ice cream over a light biscuit; strawberry shortcake with strawberry ice cream and blueberry garnish, and apricot tart on a phyllo dough crust. Arcadia is one of those institutions that endear regular patrons with homespun beguilements. That it slips up occasionally doesn't really matter. For them, Arcadia is like home.

1991-09-13	Restaurants	Contrapunto Nine-year-old Contrapunto, the vibrant pasta palace across Lexington Avenue from Bloomingdale's in the middle of the East Side cinema district, has more energy than an Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller.

1991-09-08	"DINING OUT;
An Ambitious Menu in an Unlikely Place"	"A SHOPPING-CENTER restaurant next to a Radio Shack outlet is not the usual place to find such chic dishes as a moist, ginger-scented galette of lump crabmeat in warm shallot vinaigrette, or buttery medallions of veal with wild mushrooms. But then eight-month-old Le Rendez-Vous in Burlington County is not the run-of-the-mill storefront eating place. 

To many people, Mount Laurel is better known for a court order on affordable housing than for fine dining, but this is one of a couple of intriguing new restraurants that have sprung up on the town's developing northern fringe."
1991-09-06	Restaurants	When Eldorado Petit opened on West 55th Street in Manhattan last year, it promised to introduce the distinctive and little-known seafood-based cuisine of Catalonia. It certainly had an impressive family lineage: Eldorado Petit in Barcelona, one of the city's most distinguished restaurants, and its namesake in nearby San Feliu de Guixols, are run by the second and third generations of the Cruanyas family. Looking to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona and the hoopla over the anniversary of Columbus's epochal first voyage, the Cruanyas family decided the time was ripe to expand its empire to the New World. My early visits to the restaurant found the setting to be smashing; the undistinguished Continental fare, though, generated little excitement. Eldorado Petit seemed to be taking the condescending and potentially disastrous attitude that ethnic food must be tempered for American tastes. Then two months ago, just as I was about to give up on the place, things turned around dramatically, and for the better. The highly capable chef, Antonio Buendia, formerly of the now-defunct Internacionale, steered the menu back to undiluted Catalan.
1991-09-05	Chase Issuing Certificates Backed by Card Receivables	A $750 million issue of asset-backed certificates being sold through a Chase Manhattan Credit Card Master Trust Series, 1991-2, was priced yesterday by a group of underwriters led by Chase Securities Inc. The securities, which are collateralized by Visa and Mastercard receivables sold to the trust by Chase Manhattan Bank, have a weighted average life of about four years and carry a 7.65 percent coupon. They are priced at 99.842 and yield 7.732 percent, or about 76 basis points more than the combination of yields on the three-year and five-year Treasury notes. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
1991-08-28	Phone-Service Theft Surges at Companies	A growing epidemic of telephone fraud is leaving companies and other organizations with bills for hundreds of thousands of dollars of calls they did not make, and is forcing the users of sophisticated phone equipment to scramble for better ways to lock out high-technology phone thieves. The industry has long been plagued by sophisticated users who found ways to tap into phone company lines or people who used stolen credit card numbers to make calls without paying for them.
1991-08-26	Using Credit Cards, Students Learn a Hard Lesson	As a freshman at the University of Houston, Alicia Perez signed up for classes and, in the cafeteria, for credit cards. She had no job and no credit history, but she soon had three Visa cards, a Sears card, a Discover card, two gasoline company cards and a local department store card. Today, Ms. Perez, a junior, has no cards but $6,800 worth of credit card debt.
1991-08-25	"DINING OUT;
Variety and Informality in Scarsdale"	"THE locals have already made their call on this eating spot. On a weekday evening, diners were being turned away, and it is easy to see why this place is popular. The attractive yet informal dining room, prettily arranged platters, an interesting menu of both small and large dishes and a children's menu -- all at moderate prices -- would be welcome in any community. 

Although at worst quite decent, the kitchen can be uneven. The food on our first visit was so impressive that we thought a higher rating was in the cards. But that sterling performance was not repeated uniformly again. Yet Trio's is still young, and all signs point to an even brighter future.  Credit must be given for some innovative touches in garnishes and accompaniments, brilliant strokes that added sparkle and spontaneity. Certainly all dishes profited in both color and flavor from the skillful use of vegetables, whether they appeared diced with herbs or delicately julienned and simply strewn atop a dish or fried into a nest, tempura style."
1991-08-25	Where Nostalgia Plays an Underlying Role	PRIMAVERA'S Italian accent is evident the minute you step into the main dining room of the new restaurant in New Canaan. Dominating the cozy room is a trompe l'oeil painting of ruins, arches and stones that covers an entire wall. Framed etchings of Italian scenes are clustered on other walls, which are covered with striped and marbleized wallpaper in varying shades of rose and dubonnet. In many ways Primavera's decor is more ambitious than its menu, which is mostly of a homey nature, suggesting the kind of old-fashioned, neighborhood Italian restaurant in almost everyone's memory. In fact, Primavera's most successful dishes are those that play the nostalgia theme.
1991-08-18	"DINING OUT;
Putnam View, German Flavor and More"	"ON a road well traveled by concertgoers and antiques hunters, Jagerhaus is a convenient place to have a bite to eat and to get a second wind. Certainly we can think of no more attractive German-style restaurant in this part of Putnam County. In summer, when the sun lingers, diners have a splendid view of the farmlands stretching to the Dutchess hills.  In winter, the cozy, rustic charm of the place is brightened by a cheery, glowing fire. Christmas garlands and pin lights in evidence the year round seem to suggest that whatever the month, at Jagerhaus the season for rib-sticking food is now. 

While less than fabulous, the food was acceptable, with non-Germanic preparations often the better choices. A few light dishes -- chicken breast, shrimp, pasta, salmon -- reminded us that it was summer. But the main thrust of the menu was in robust food, as plain as steaks and as fancy as stuffed pheasant. Considering the restaurant's name, which means hunter's lodge, the game offerings were appropriate, and such items as buffalo steak, venison and duck were listed among conventional veal, pork and beef schnitzels and bratens."
1991-08-18	Free Air Miles To Be Linked To Shopping	By early next year, consumers will be able to earn free air travel by purchasing products from businesses participating in a program called Air Miles. A similar plan has been operating in Britain since 1988 and includes such businesses as Shell Oil, I.B.M., Toshiba, National Westminster Bank, Visa and Mastercard. Sponsors for the North American Air Miles program will be announced in November, according to Loyalty Management Group, a marketing firm that is operating the program in North America. It says they will include fast-food restaurants, credit cards, oil companies, sellers of packaged goods, grocery chains and retail and department stores. Participating airlines so far are American, United and Air Canada. The marketing group says two more major carriers are expected to join the plan.
1991-08-18	It's Italian, but Not Awash in Red Sauce	SUMMER came early this year, and East End restaurants also were blossoming well before Memorial Day. One late bloomer was 1 Ocean Road in Bridgehampton, which made its debut closer to Independence Day than Decoration Day. Things got off to a rocky start. The restaurant was packed on opening night when a fire broke out, driving the hordes of diners into the street. Yet, no evidence of that initial disaster remains at this high, wide, sparkling-white newcomer.
1991-08-11	Ms. Krutan Weds Stephen J. Bartell	Diane Sue Krutan, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Krutan of Edison, N.J., was married in New York last evening to Stephen Jay Bartell, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Bartell of San Diego. Rabbi A. Bruce Goldman performed the ceremony in Central Park. Mrs. Bartell, 35 years old, is a vice president at Ally & Gargano Advertising in New York. She graduated from Rutgers University. Her father is a vice president and the director of merchandising at Botany 500, the clothing company, in New York. Her mother, Ruth Krutan, designs jewelry.
1991-08-09	Restaurants	Onda Among the scores of restaurateurs who are trying to reel in elusive patrons with the alluring bait of economy, Len Allison and Karen Hubert may be the most eccentric. The former owners of Huberts on Park Avenue, which closed last year, moved downtown to smaller and less costly quarters, hired a bare-bones staff and opened a restaurant that defies a simple label. What do you call a place that on one menu offers shrimp with radish pudding and Chinese sausage, goat cheese lasagna, Indonesian-style veal-shank stew, and roast chicken with lemon -- the United Nations? They call it Onda. The mahogany-lined rectangular dining room is as offbeat as the food. Bronze candle sconces and little religious paintings line the walls while the Shirelles coo over the sound system. Well-spaced tables are draped in paper, reinforcing the relaxed theme. Servers are casually attired, taking a cue from the gregarious manager, who comes to your table wearing a plaid sport shirt, a nascent beard and a little gold fish dangling from one ear. Hey, this place could be fun. And it is fun if you order the right dishes, but doing that takes some investigation. Many of the menu items have two prices, one as an appetizer, one as a main course. This is a good idea for those who like to mix and match. An appetizer of sauteed tenderloin of pork is pleasing, the thin slices of meat served on skewers with a spicy peanut sauce and a cooling cucumber salad. Roasted peanuts resurface in a melange of Chinese rice-stick noodles with butterflied shrimp, tofu and bean sprouts. It's a lively combination, on the sweet side, with good textural contrast. The sweet tooth is sated again in the soft-shell crabs with a sweet-hot sauce of fish stock, sake, red pepper and chili pepper. A nice communal munchie is the crisply fried baby calamari with pungent tamarind sauce. Pastas also can be a starter or a main course. Lasagna with sun-dried tomatoes, bound with a mortar of dense goat cheese, was too heavy and assertive. You might instead try the pansotti, a Ligurian ravioli that is filled with spinach and enlivened with a pastelike sauce of ground walnuts and herbs. Onda has a small but well-selected wine inventory. Prices are very modest across the board. You might try the fruity, dry 1988 Chinon from Domaine de la Chapellerie ($19) with succulent roasted quails that are oddly paired with a Chinatown-style egg roll filled with cabbage, carrots and Chinese greens. Roasted chicken with a parsley puree under the skin, asparagus and lemon garnish is deftly done. It is crisp outside and moist within, sitting in a clear lemony broth. Another good choice is a twist on osso buco, sinewy but tender veal shank with a rich, sweetish caramelized onion sauce and toasted polenta sticks. The indelicate Indonesian veal-shank stew, however, is overpowered by coconut milk. The Chinese-style roasted duck is probably the best effort of all, served with bok choy and water chestnuts. Seafood does not fare so well. Fried red snapper Thai style with scallops and roasted sweet pepper is colorful but bland, and the highly perfumed steamed flounder with ginger and scallion has nothing over what might be served at a run-of-the-mill Cantonese restaurant. The ingenuous summer desserts are more fun than throwing your sister into a swimming pool. The banana splits reminded me of my teen-age pigouts on a Jersey Shore boardwalk, and the hot fudge sundae is just as excessive, sans bananas. Chocolate rum espresso cheesecake is every bit as iniquitous as it sounds. Lemon pound cake was crumbly dry on one tasting, better the next time. Onda's funky international approach to budget dining may not be to everyone's taste. But if the idea of a culinary Cook's Tour intrigues you, it can be recommended. Andiamo When Andiamo opened in 1987, it was the biggest thing to hit the Lincoln Center area since Luciano Pavarotti first strolled up to the footlights. This stagy northern Italian restaurant boasted a first-rate chef, an energetic staff and a stylish loft setting. Nearly four years later, it is still going at a relatively brisk pace. The original chef, Frank Crispo, moved on last year and was replaced by his second, Gregory Godon. Mr. Godon's menu is similar in style to his predecesor's, if perhaps just a little less consistent. Andiamo is hidden down a corridor behind a casual streetfront spot called Cafe Bel Canto, under the same ownership. At the entrance is a soaring loft with a balcony reached by an iron staircase. Track lights illuminate abstract paintings, and a papier-mache saloon pianist is frozen in mid-song on a wide platform at the back of the room. Tables are generously separated, and conversation tends to float away in this soaring space. Nonsmokers may be pleased to know that smoking is prohibited anywhere in the restaurant. Two upbeat starters are the mussels steamed in a subtle tomato-cream broth, and the mild, beefy-tasting venison carpaccio, which is seared outside, then sliced and served with tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and provolone. Fried calamari, served over mixed greens and deep-fried spinach, would have been fine had they not lingered backstage too long, arriving flaccid. One dish could not be passed up, for it sounded too outlandish: prosciutto, fresh figs and peach-flavored whipped cream with mint garnish. After sampling it, my table of four voted 3 to 1 in favor. (I was in the majority.) While the whipped cream was superfluous, the combination wasn't bad at all: minimally sweet, with a hint of peaches. Agnolotti filled with lobster and porcini and served in a mushroom-cream sauce sounded like a sure winner, but the filling could have been bread crumbs for all the flavor of mushrooms and lobster that came through. The sauce was the best part. A rich, fork-tender duck confit is served on greens and beets. Andiamo's wine list is rich in selections from virtually all over Italy. A good selection of American chardonnays is available, as is a sampling of red Bordeaux. Prices are about average. The service staff is still knowledgeable and hard-working. Pastas are uneven. A formidable-looking mountain of penne with pesto and sliced almonds has a snowcap of deep-fried leeks. Underneath all this was hidden a fillet of salmon. The whole assembly was like one of those Pentagon test missiles that do expensive swan dives into the ocean: both are made of quality parts, but when assembled they just don't fly. Whole-wheat pappardelle came with flabby, unappetizing sweetbreads in a shiitake cream sauce, and the chef's variation on spaghetti puttanesca, with sausages and tomato, was overwhelmed by salty black and green olives. One of the best pastas sampled was angel hair with briny clams and shrimp and scallops in a good shellfish broth tinged with saffron. Among seafood offerings, a special of red snapper over spinach with a sauce of lobster broth was delicate and flavorful. Sauteed halibut steak, another special, was perfectly cooked and accompanied by roasted corn and fresh peas. Tuna encrusted with sesame seeds, fennel seeds and crushed red pepper over couscous and a sesame oil vinaigrette was overpowering; the tuna was lost amid the fireworks. Lamb chops, served with white beans, tomato and green beans, are nicely done, as is a grilled sirloin steak with garlic, black peppercorns and roasted vegetables. If you crave something sweet before the opera or symphony, chocolate layer cake on a chocolate-latticed plate with coconut ice cream should do the trick. Creme brulee with raspberries is pleasing, better than the undistinguished gelati and pallid fruit sorbets. Fried banana slices come with walnuts and Jack Daniels gelato, which is boozy but unbalanced. Instead, try the tuile cone filled with gelatin-thickened Marsala cream and ringed with fresh fruit. While not so harmonious as it once was, Andiamo is still worth noting when you look for dinner before or after Lincoln Center performances.

1991-08-04	Style, Sustenance and Value in Bridgeport	"ON a reader's tip, we went to downtown Bridgeport looking for a Haitian restaurant -- only to discover that the scrawled word ""Haitian"" was really ""Italian."" When we entered Ralph 'n' Rich's, we suspected we had made another mistake: the dark bar seemed just for drinking rather than dining as well. But as we started to slide into an upholstered booth in the rear, a waitress appeared and asked if we wouldn't prefer the dining room. ""Of course,"" we all but shouted. Past the bar and the kitchen, we found a stylishly modern, high-ceilinged dining room. Large Art Deco mirrors faced each other on opposite walls; beneath them were banquettes upholstered in soft blue fabric. Wainscoting and trim painted a delicate orchid, with a plum-colored carpet on the floor, well-napped and well-spaced tables, and curtained windows facing a side street, all bore signs of a caring management."
1991-07-28	A Talent for Grilling Steaks and Chops	HAMPTONITES who know restaurants know Carol's. Prominently situated on Route 27 in Southampton, it opened a dozen or so years ago as a fancy French spot. Seven years ago, Carol Rosenwald switched from haute cuisine to down home and renamed her restaurant Carol's Great Hampton Chicken and Rib Company.
1991-07-21	"DINING OUT;
Italian Cuisine, and the Setting Is Casual"	"PAT and Carol Piccolo, owners of the well-regarded Italian restaurant in Pine Brook that bears their name, recently opened a casual 34-seat Italian cafe in Morristown. Settebello, which is a few doors down from Macy's parking lot, occupies the second-floor space that used to be Savannah's, an eating place that specialized in home-style Southern cooking. 

The tiny dining room has been totally redone, so that now there are terra-cotta tiles on the floor, the tables have malachite-colored tile tops surrounded by wood, and the chairs are bentwood. Mr. Piccolo has already bought the rest of the historic building, and when the town lifts its sewer ban (it is in the process of building a new one), Mr. and Mrs. Piccolo intend to expand the restaurant and include outdoor dining in the courtyard."
1991-07-21	"DINING OUT;
A Serious Menu Set in Country Charm"	"OPEN since September, Les Bons Copains is Rockland's latest contender in the serious cuisine class, but it is the lovely country charm of the place that sets the tone, which is not at all solemn. 

The ubiquitous country style in restaurant decoration has undergone a transfusion here. These generous dining rooms are country the way aristocratic country manors are country -- with high ceilings, touches of dark carved woods, a luxury of ample tables, flowers in profusion, lovely William Morris-style wallpapers and trim, both leaded and etched glass, French lace curtains and comfortable wooden-slat chairs with seatcovers done in a needlepoint floral design."
1991-07-21	A Caribbean Corner in Litchfield County	CARIBBEAN cuisine is rare in Connecticut, and finding an inn featuring such fare on a quiet road in the state's northwest corner is even more surprising. The Salisbury Inn, between Salisbury and Canaan, looks like a typical white clapboard New England farmhouse, with a motel-style building to one side. The house's interior -- a small, completely modern dining room with one mirrored wall, wood floors, well-spaced tables, armless Windsor chairs and soft lighting -- does not reveal the inn's double identity. Only ceiling fans, an accent of hanging greenery and tiny red parrots stenciled in corners of the white walls offer clues.
1991-07-07	"DINING OUT;
Spicy Seafood and Pasta in Purchase"	"Soon to celebrate its fourth birthday, Cobble Creek Cafe remains one of the charming restaurants in the area. The dew is still there -- in the physical space, the service, the kitchen. And newly in charge of that kitchen is Joseph Sasso, whose creations we enjoyed at the Gallery Restaurant in Tarrytown, which has since closed. 

Although Mr. Sasso seems to be performing under some constriction here -- garnishes and embellishments (one of this chef's strengths) lack the wit and flamboyance he has exhibited in the past -- most of his work is admirable nontheless."
1991-07-06	'Gold' Cards May Be Fool's Gold	The Federal Trade Commission is warning consumers about offers of gold or platinum credit cards from marketers not affiliated with major credit-card companies. The agency also warns consumers about inflated promises of improved credit ratings associated with such cards. While the gold or platinum cards may seem like general-purpose credit cards, they generally permit consumers to buy merchandise only from certain catalogues, the commission said. And getting such a card rarely improves a customer's credit rating, the F.T.C. said, despite pitches to the contrary. The commission advises consumers to be wary.
1991-06-30	In Cromwell, Thai Food to Tease the Palate	FOR a while, Thai restaurants were popping up throughout Connecticut. Now, after a recession-induced slowdown, there is a new one, Thai Gardens, in the town of Cromwell, near Middletown. It is a welcome addition, both for its attractive and spacious dining room (including tables and floor cushions for Thai-style seating) in a small shopping center and, more important, for the authentic taste of the dishes on its sizable menu.
1991-06-28	Restaurants	Le Pescadou The widespread popularity of bistros in New York City, paired with the surging consumption of seafood, made the all-seafood bistro inevitable. Enter Le Pescadou, a smart-looking little place in SoHo that serves an invariably fresh and diverse catch at reasonable prices.
1991-06-23	"DINING OUT;
Marking Hot Thai Tastes in Scarsdale"	"FROM the bland cooking of its early days, Bangkok 54 has progressed over the last few years to producing mouth-filling dishes full of complex flavors. Unfortunately, the kitchen did not stop while it was ahead and, as though to add even more flavor, has recently turned on the heat, applying to a number of dishes hot chili peppers in doses that would ignite an asbestos tongue. 

 Next to every menu item a chili-pepper symbol supposedly measures the dish's fire. No chilies indicate that a dish has negligible heat; and a key printed on the menu assigns one, two and three chilies to a range of intensities that begin at ""mild"" and end at ""very hot and spicy."" But the kitchen seems unaware of this system, and spiciness is applied, or not, whimsically."
1991-06-20	Sears's Plan To Offer Visa Is Set Back	Visa U.S.A. Inc. said today that the Federal appeals court in Denver had effectively blocked a plan by Sears, Roebuck & Company to offer Visa credit cards through a Utah savings and loan owned by Sears. The appellate court's ruling overturns a preliminary injunction that was issued against Visa in February by a Federal district court in Salt Lake City, Visa said. The injunction had blocked Visa's attempt to keep Sears from offering the cards. The matter will now to proceed to trial; no date has been set.
1991-06-18	Ford Offering Credit Cards In Effort to Lure Car Buyers	In the latest skirmish in the credit card wars, the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that one of its financial services units would offer a credit card as a marketing tool to help retain old Ford customers and attract new ones. But the Chrysler Corporation may also be planning to enter the credit card business, according to The American Banker, a trade publication. Unlike the Ford program, Chrysler's effort would be for private-label cards that would not carry the Chrysler logo but rather the name of a furniture store or similar issuer, the publication said.
1991-06-16	"DINING OUT;
Some Entrees Are Surprisingly Polished"	"JUST about all the bases are covered at Jake's, a casual and convivial new eating place near the Flemington Circle. The Hunterdon County restaurant and watering hole may be trying to be all things to all men -- not to mention families with small children, singles and discount shoppers -- but what is unexpected is that it also has something to offer diners who appreciate well-prepared, updated food and interesting wines.

A highway restaurant decorated with mock pub signs and offering an overlong menu that lists everything from bar fare like Buffalo chicken ""tenders"" to hamburgers to veal parmigiana leads one to expect chain-restaurant quality, but some of the dishes are surprisingly polished. That is because the owners had the good sense to bring in as chef William Kinslow, who formerly cooked at Chatfield's in Gladstone and, before that, at Giovanna's in Plainfield."
1991-06-16	Where Sushi Lovers Get a Wide Selection	ABIS, the new Japanese restaurant in Greenwich, is easy to spot by its blue ceramic tile roof entrance on Greenwich Avenue. Inside, a sense of authenticity continues, with a further suggestion of roof edging one wall, from which traditional Japanese cast-iron lanterns are hung. A tatami mat section is recessed along one wall; you remove your shoes to enter, then sit on cushions, tucking your feet into an open space beneath the table. The center dining area gives way in the rear to a sushi bar, where you can select from a display of fresh sea creatures and watch the sushi chefs at work. (The clear plastic wrap around each piece of fish may help retain freshness, but it isn't very esthetically pleasing.)
1991-06-14	Air War in the Credit Card Battle	"In its latest counterattack against growing challenges from Visa and Mastercard, the American Express Company said yesterday that it would sharply expand the ways travelers could accumulate frequent-flier credits. As do competing bank ""affinity cards"" with ties to airlines, American Express will give its card holders one frequent-flier mile for every dollar they charge on their Green, Gold, Platinum, Optima and Corporate cards. Any purchase, whether it be flowers, sweaters, college tuition or vacations, earns the miles, which are redeemable for free airline tickets or ticket upgrades to first class."
1991-06-09	"DINING OUT;
In Bedford, a Stress on Fresh Ingredients"	"NOW in its 14th year, Bistro 22 has without doubt become a fixture in Bedford Village. The gorgeous dining room and dependable kitchen has attracted not only a faithful regular clientele but a seasonal concert-going crowd as well, music lovers who find this restaurant ideally situated for a repast on their way to nearby Caramoor. 

 Much of the credit for Bistro 22's success is due David Fehr, the chef and owner, who over the years has kept in close touch with shifting culinary trends. Fresh ingredients plucked from the day's marketbasket have always been the first choice of this kitchen, and more recently Mr. Fehr has focused on perfecting light sauces and employing natural sweetness and seasonings. Diners concerned with fat intake should note that a star precedes those dishes on the menu that are prepared without any butter or cream."
1991-06-09	Westport Gets an Indian Restaurant	WITH Indian restaurants popping up elsewhere in Fairfield County, it was probably only a matter of time before one opened in Westport. Enter Sheesh Mahal. Its name means mirror palace, something of an exaggeration for the long, narrow storefront restaurant in a small shopping complex. A mirror is evident on the left wall, and other mirrors are the glittering glass bits in the many Kashmiri fabrics displayed along the cream-toned stucco walls. Though small, Sheesh Mahal is modestly attractive, and the single staff member is gracious. Service is often painfully slow, though, and you can plan on spending a considerable amount of time at either lunch or dinner. The menu, largely from north India, presents numerous fine choices. You might begin with chicken chat, a well-spiced mixture of chicken chunks simmered in a tart, tangy tamarind sauce. For an appetizer sampling, try the Sheesh Mahal assortment. It contains vegetable samosa (a deep-fried turnover with potato-and-pea stuffing), chicken tikka (tandoori-cooked chicken pieces subtly spiced -- also available as an entree), pakora (deep-fried, vegetable-filled fritters), seesh kabab (a frankfurter-shaped patty of ground meat) and pappadum (paper-thin, spicy lentil wafers). Both the samosa and pakora can be ordered separately, but the $6.95 assortment platter was generous enough for four guests to sample.
1991-06-08	Ride on Credit: Make It J.F.K. and Don't Spare the Plastic!	Eight yellow taxicabs are driving around New York City, hardly distinguishable from the 11,000 others. But inside each is a small sign stuck to the window. It tells you that you can pay with a credit card. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission last week began testing a new high-technology taxi meter that accepts American Express cards. In the future it could take Visa, Mastercard and other major credit cards.
1991-06-02	Pun-Filled Pizza Operation Branches Out	SINCE its 1989 opening, Sunrise Pizza Cafe in East Norwalk has expanded its successful pizza operation to two neighboring towns. Judging by the steady flow of traffic we observed at both, success has bred success. In appearance, the two are no clones of their Norwalk parent. The brand-new Sunrise Pizza Cafe in New Canaan, down an attractive, flower-lined walkway (transformed from an alley), is in an area that is becoming a restaurant row. Inside, diners can sit at one of three tables facing the pizza-making operation. A relatively larger upstairs room is cozy and decidedly informal.
1991-05-31	First Chicago Is Offering $1 Billion in Debt Securities	The First Chicago Corporation is offering $1 billion in debt securities through First Chicago Master Trust II 1991-D. These securities are backed by Visa and Mastercard receivables through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. The lead underwriter, Salomon Brothers, said the 8.4 percent certificates, which have an average life of five years based on controlled amortization, are priced at 99.47, to yield 8.6 percent, or about 94.4 basis points more than the five-year Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Underwriters said the expected final maturity date is Dec. 16, 1996, while the legal maturity date is June 17, 1998.
1991-05-26	"DINING OUT;
French Fare That Is Better Than Ever"	"JOSEPH GOMEZ bought Le Petit Chateau in Bernardsville nine years ago. Since then, it has undergone many changes: it has been redecorated, and chefs and servers have come and gone. In fact, the only thing that has really been consistent at this Somerset County restaurant is a steady improvement in all areas. 

A small Tudor-style building, which is near the top of the road leading from the Bernardsville train station, houses the French restaurant. It seats 60 in two small dining rooms, one of which has a bar at one end."
1991-05-25	Stores Battle Credit Cards (With Theirs)	"Department and specialty stores have started a campaign of vigorous promotion of their own charge cards. Buffeted by the rising use of ""third-party"" cards like Visa, Mastercard and American Express , they are pulling out all the stops. For consumers, the store cards sometimes offer advantages the third-party cards do not: special sales, opportunities for free or reduced-price travel and quicker authorization of credit transactions. For stores, there are other benefits: a source of information that can be used to track consumer purchases, a base of regular customers who spend much more than cash customers, and the opportunity to avoid the fee third parties charge merchants."
1991-05-22	Yield at 8.312% on Offering By MBNA Credit Card Trust	MBNA Credit Card Trust 1991-A, a unit of the MBNA Corporation, is offering $750 million in securities backed by Visa and Mastercard receivables through underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities. The 8 1/4 percent securities were priced at 99 30/32 to yield 8.312 percent, or about 86 basis points more than the combination of yield on three-year and five-year Treasury securities. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
1991-05-19	"DINING OUT;
11 Varieties of Pizza in White Plains"	"UNO, self-proclaimed originator of deep dish or Chicago pizza, has added another eatery to its thriving nationwide dozens, this time a block away from the Court House in White Plains. This modestly priced restaurant is a versatile addition to the area's eateries. Children can have early supper in the dining room while the separate, roomy, convivial bar plays to a dressy, well-heeled, after-work crowd (standing five-deep on a recent Friday afternoon). Later, couples and friends fill the banquettes, and politicos wind down with even later-night snacks in the calm of the greenhouse -- Uno's prettiest spot. A sidewalk cafe will soon be in full swing as well.

Uno specializes in pizzas and puts together 11 varieties that can be further embellished with the usual extras -- sausage, mushrooms, olives and so forth -- to give diners an even greater choice. The deep-dish dough yields an unusually light, flaky crust. The pizzas come in individual and regular sizes, the generous latter meant for two, although if three shared it none would leave hungry. We suggest ordering regular-sized pizza -- deeper, with less bread, more filling -- and taking home any leftovers."
1991-05-19	France	To the Editor: While trying to pay for merchandise with my Mastercard in Strasbourg recently, I was asked to enter my personal identification number (PIN) on a numeric keypad. Given that I had just received my card, I told the cashier that I did not know my PIN but that I had my passport to prove my identity. I was told that the only way that I could use my Mastercard to make a purchase was by entering my PIN on the keypad. I ended up paying cash. I understand that it is increasingly common for stores in France to ask credit card customers to enter their PIN's when making purchases. Upon my return to the United States, I called my bank, Associates National. I was told that the sole purpose of a PIN was for use at an automatic teller machine. I then contacted Mastercard International and was told that a vendor can do as he pleases. PHILIPPE MAGLOIRE Malone, N.Y. Marianne Fulgenzie, director of marketing public relations for Mastercard International, replies: The merchant probably mistook Mr. Magloire's card for what is called a chip card, of which there are approximately two million circulating in France, and those cards do require the input of a PIN. All other Mastercards can be processed without a PIN.
1991-05-12	"DINING OUT;
California Flair in Croton-on-Hudson"	"TUCKED away in a complex of shops and offices, Sonoma could be missed by all but the determined seeker. Those who find this oasis will be charmed by its California conception edged with a bit of the Southwest. The peak and beams of its ceilings and the clean white and oak look are inviting, as are its genuinely caring service, its laid-back ambience, its menu, its wine list of Sonoma Valley bottles, its moderate prices and much of its food.

The kitchen's good intentions occasionally miss the mark, and health-consciousness sometimes makes the ingredients, fresh as they are, oddly dull. Where little or no salt is used, a welcome restraint, other flavorings must come into play if the character of a dish is to be preserved. Nevertheless, despite any flaws, the dining here is mighty pleasant."
1991-05-12	"DINING OUT;
Dishes of Morocco and the Middle East"	"THE exterior of Alkhimah, an 18-month-old restaurant in a shopping mall in the Gloucester County community of Cherry Hill, gives no indication of the Middle Eastern and Moroccan delights inside. After passing through the front door and parting the long, heavy draperies covering the inner doorway, diners may take a moment to become accustomed to the dimly lighted interior.

Then, as the room comes into focus, so do the walls and ceiling, hung with dark, coarsely woven authentic Berber tenting; the beaded hanging lamps and the deep banquettes covered with bright rugs and velvets. These are strewn with cushions, some of which glitter with silver or gold threads."
1991-05-12	Second-Story Restaurant, Two-Tier Menu	STONE HORSE, yet another new restaurant in New Canaan, has totally revamped the spacious second story of a building it shares with the New Canaan Racquet Club. The restaurant, which is a visual delight, has three dining areas (one smoking, two nonsmoking tiered ones) and well-spaced tables. The lively bar is separated from the nonsmoking sections by and a central divider of white columns, assorted plants and fresh flowers in handsome terra cotta planters and a large gray-white pony-size stone horse. Except for overloud taped music in the early dining hours, the atmosphere is one of comfortable, casual dining.
1991-05-05	"DINING OUT;
A View and More in North Tarrytown"	"GOOD news travels fast. Open scarcely two months, Goldie's has not advertised yet on some evenings prospective diners will find every one of this miniature restaurant's 44 seats occupied. It's not the decor that draws the crowd: the interior seems nothing more than an unplanned, homey hodgepodge of several dark woods and a bit of brick and stained glass. But one hardly notices because of the splendid, eye-catching view of the Tappan Zee Bridge beyond the restaurant's picture windows. 

 While not exactly ""by the bridge,"" Goldie's is close enough for diners to enjoy, of an evening, the full effect of the stretch of sparkling lights as they disappear into the glimmering clusters that mark the Rockland County river towns. The intervening fence of the General Motors parking lot becomes less visible as the night darkens."
1991-05-04	Your Money; Teaching Youth Virtue of Saving	"When Steven L. Sanders was a kid, his parents were about to buy him a pair of cheap sneakers instead of the terrific pair he wanted. He bargained with them. ""Give me the money you were going to spend,"" he said, ""and I'll earn the difference."" They accepted. He got a paper route and cleaned out a mayonnaise jar to save his money. He got those sneakers, but it was tough. A couple of times the money in the jar proved irresistible."
1991-05-01	Economic Scene; Credit Card Conundrum	EVER wonder why your bank charges 19 percent interest on credit card balances when it is paying only 6 percent on money market accounts? Join the throng. Interest on bank cards seems to be defying the laws of competition, having risen almost a percentage point in the last two years even as the rates banks pay to attract deposits have fallen. Some analysts are convinced that credit card customers are paying for the banks' lemming-like rush to throw good money at bad business deals during the late 1980's. Others offer a variation on the same theme: Banks, they say, are gouging small borrowers because there are not enough big ones around to carry the overhead.
1991-04-28	"DINING OUT;
A Primer for a Leisurely Brunch of Dim Sum"	"SOME culinary trends reach the county slowly, often years after they have been forgotten as the hot topic of the day in pace-setting places like Manhattan or Los Angeles. Ultimately, however, the ripples do come our way.

County diners can now enjoy, for example, excellent sushi and the savory food of Thailand, Korea and the many regions of India, as well as California- and Louisiana-influenced dishes. And the number of places bringing us these treasures is rising."
1991-04-17	Credit Card Lawsuit Filed	Visa International and Mastercard International are seeking $95 million in damages from telemarketing companies they assert cheated thousands of people seeking low-interest credit cards. The lawsuit, filed in Federal court here on Monday, charged that fraud and high-pressure sales tactics had been used to get people to pay inflated sums -- from $70 to $200 -- on the promise they would obtain low- interest bank cards.
1991-04-14	In Danbury, Grape Leaves and Baklava	CONSIDERING that the Lebanese cuisine is one of the most respected in the Middle East, and that Danbury has a large Lebanese population, one might expect the city to have many Lebanese restaurants. With the appearance of Roland's of Lebanon, the number seems to have doubled -- to two. Roland's of Lebanon is hardly prepossessing. Its dimly lighted, exceedingly modest storefront locale is as bare bones as a sit-down dining room can be -- just a handful of tables, seating at most 32, with a counter area at the entrance where pizza can be ordered to take out.
1991-04-13	Germans Sigh and Say, 'Charge It'	"After decades of scorning credit cards as a plastic plague threatening Germany's economic health, the nation's banks are discovering virtue in cashless consumerism. 

Credit cards were often treated as luxuries for German business executives and tourists to use outside the country. Bankers used to warn that promoting the cards at home could encourage department stores, oil companies and auto makers to invade the banks' turf and take some of their business."
1991-04-13	More Restaurants Are Just Saying No to American Express	Consumers across the country are leaving home without their American Express cards because many restaurants are no longer accepting them. The fees for the card, restaurateurs say, are too high. The restaurants include places like Jasper's in Boston, Cafe Provencal in the Chicago area and Orso in New York and Los Angeles. Most are white-linen restaurants, although others are casual.
1991-04-08	New York City Promoting Parade for Veterans of Gulf	"WITH the help of American Express and that company's marketing expertise, New York City is beginning an extensive campaign today to promote its ""welcome home"" parade in June for the troops who served in the Persian Gulf. The campaign, expected to get at least $10 million in donated media time and space, is intended to encourage millions of people to attend the parade and to raise the $3 million needed for the celebration, including an elaborate fireworks display. Additional money will be used to assist veterans of the gulf conflict and other wars."
1991-04-07	"DINING OUT;
Fresh Fish at Moderate Prices in Tuckahoe"	IN its three-year tenure in downtown Tuckahoe, this branch of several Manhattan-based seafood establishments has dug in for the long haul, offering its diverse clientele moderate prices and fresh fish. For late-night arrivals, there are a number of light dishes, and on Thursdays through Saturdays, there is entertainment.  Those interested in dining only tend to come in early for the fish, pasta and salads. A younger crowd queues up later, when greeting, meeting and light eating take over, with food a secondary concern.
1991-04-07	"DINING OUT;
A Tiny Place With a Sophisticated Menu"	"ALTHOUGH Culinary Renaissance sounds awfully grand for a shoebox cafe beside the railroad tracks in the Middlesex County town of Metuchen, the pretentious name does justice to the generally superb food served there.

In an area short on sophisticated contemporary dining, who would expect to find a tiny place that offers barely poached oysters atop melted leeks glossed with a sheer beurre blanc? Or buttery veal medallions with fresh artichokes and gnocchi in a light veal sauce laced with port, followed, perhaps, by a napoleon of crisp pastry layers filled with mocha mascarpone mousse on a puddle of chocolate sauce?"
1991-04-07	Pizza and Pasta on a Light-Hearted Menu	A RESTAURANT'S skills can often best be measured by the dishes that dominate the menu. The point is brought home at Centro, a new restaurant in Glenville section of Greenwich, on the Westchester line, where the primary categories are pastas and pizzas. In-depth exploration of the menu confirmed that these are the specialties in which Centro shines. Centro in Fairfield has been thriving for several years, but its Greenwich offshoot is new, situated in a converted brick mill facing a waterfall. The restaurant has smoking and non-smoking areas and a bar with a few tables for dining. The light-hearted Italianate spirit in the decor is augmented by butcher-paper-topped tables with jars of crayons for doodling and the springlike touch of blooming primrose plants. Patrons' framed crayon drawings add a cheerful touch to the walls.
1991-04-05	Restaurants	Raoul's For all those nouveau bistros striving to stay above water for more than three American Express statements, Raoul's is a paradigm -- 15 successful years of cassoulet, Cotes-du-Rhone and cigarette smoke. What makes Raoul's thrive while so many others tremble? After three recent visits, the answer seems to be a genuine feeling of neighborhood, an affable staff and better-than-average food.
1991-04-03	Road Service Offer By Universal Card	The Universal Card, the combination credit card and telephone charge card issued by A.T.& T., said it would offer a toll-free number for emergency auto service. For an $18 annual fee, Universal customers in the United States and Canada can use the number. Emergency Road Service Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., will operate the service. Citibank, the nation's largest issuer of Visa and Mastercard credit cards, escalated the competition among credit card issuers ealier this week by guaranteeing clients the lowest prices for most products bought with its cards.
1991-04-01	A Citibank Promise To Shoppers	"In the latest enticement to credit-card users, Citibank plans to announce as early as today that it will guarantee people who shop with its cards that they will pay the lowest available price for their purchases. Citibank, the world's largest issuer of credit cards, said the service would cover consumer electronics, furniture, clothing and many other goods, but not air travel, art or antiques. Goods bought at ""going out of business,"" ""limited quantity"" and ""cash only"" sales, as well as at ""close-out prices,"" will not be covered, Citibank said."
1991-03-31	Barbecue Experts Open a Slicker Place	FANS of Stick to Your Ribs, who for years have made pilgrimages to the Texas barbecue specialist's roadside shrine just off Interstate 95 in Stratford, will be pleased to learn that a new location has been added -- also off Interstate 95, at Exit 9 on the Stamford-Darien line. This newer, slicker version makes dining downright civil -- no picnic tables within sight and sound of the highway. Instead, there's a real indoor dining room, a full bar and the expected take-out area. Stick to Your Ribs is the place to find beef brisket, chopped beef, beef and pork ribs, pork shoulder and chopped pork as menu highlights. The meats are slow-baked (up to 18 hours, the menu says) over a fire of oak, hickory and occasionally mesquite. (One night we thought we detected the presence of apple wood, but it isn't mentioned on the menu, nor is a petroleum essence that seemed to permeate our barbecued Texas beef brisket and chunky beef-laden Texas chili one evening.)
1991-03-29	Restaurants	"'21' Club Many New York diners keep a curious eye on the vicissitudes of the ""21"" Club the way they would a kindly and fragile old uncle -- even some who have never been there. Such is the allure of this historic institution steeped in the lore of Prohibition."
1991-03-24	Home-Style Cuisine Acts Like a Magnet	PURELY COUNTRY is a label that evokes homey, natural, nostalgic images. A restaurant with such a name is like a magnet for people who eat out a lot and crave a sense of the homemade -- or at least home style, judging by the crowds that fill Purely Country restaurant in the center of Milford. Stepping over the threshold of this former luncheonette, our first emotion was dismay. A long counter, with globe lights of differing sizes, ceiling fans and a narrow passageway past tables for two to the rear, where tables flank the aisle, evoked a sense of uncomfortable crowding. But once ensconced at a table, with a dot-matrix-printed menu in hand, reassurance crept back. The menu is intriguing, with inventive touches. And the fact that it changes weekly also suggests a degree of creativity -- or at least ambition -- in the kitchen.
1991-03-23	Top U.S. Auditor Criticizes Plan To Bolster Bank Insurance Fund	"The Government's senior auditor today sharply criticized the Administration's proposal to bolster the dwindling bank insurance fund by extending its borrowing authority to $70 billion. In his first interview about the Treasury plan to reorganize the program that protects bank deposits, Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, said that extending the fund's borrowing ability was an unrealistic way of handling the growing crisis that would ""ultimately hurt the Administration's credibility."""
1991-03-22	Restaurants	Whenever I used to tell dining companions that I was taking them to a Greek restaurant, they would respond with a slack grin, as if I had suggested we attend an all-night bouzouki competition. Perceptions of Greek food in New York City have been etched largely by those modest storefront spots characterized by washed-out photographs of the Aegean coast, checkered tablecloths and ragged gray lamb gyros in the windows. Enter Periyali in late 1987, a charming restaurant run by Nicola Kotsoni and Steve Tzolis, and New Yorkers' ideas of Greek cuisine changed dramatically. The main dining room has white stucco walls, colorful banquettes, a long wooden bar and billows of fabric hanging overhead to conceal the sound tile. It works, for the noise is well muted. The snug back rooms surround an alluring outdoor garden.
1991-03-17	Uncommon Dishes Spark a Chinese Menu	"RESTAURANTS with panda in the name have proliferated in Connecticut, and one of the more notable is Panda Inn in West Hartford. White walls, segmented by natural wood frames, and hung with Chinese art, booths and tables with dubonnet cloths and high-backed black wood-trimmed chairs all suggest a degree of stylishness beyond that of the stereotypical ""gilded dragon"" decor. Panda Inn's menu is a large one, with 46 ""chef's suggestions"" alone, and since so many Chinese menus in Connecticut seem cloned one from another, diners naturally gravitate to dishes that are less commonly seen."
1991-03-16	Secured Credit Cards: Ask Before You Leap	As many as 40 million Americans cannot obtain credit, including the two million people a year whose credit cards are revoked, specialists in the banking field say. These consumers, as well as others who have difficulty getting bank cards like Visa or Mastercard, are the prime candidates for a category of cards known as secured cards. They are usually willing to pay for the privilege of having a credit card with annual fees, interest rates, late charges and over-limit fees higher than those of regular credit cards.
1991-03-15	F.C.C. TAKES STEPS TO COMBAT ABUSES ON '900' NUMBERS	"The Federal Communications Commission proposed rules today aimed at preventing fraud and deceit by companies that provide information and services through ""900"" telephone lines. There are ""900"" numbers that provide everything from stock quotations and sports scores to titillating sexual messages. They are among the fastest-growing segments of the telephone industry and are expected to generate revenues of more than $1 billion this year. But they have also garnered thousands of complaints from consumers who say they were misled about what they received and what they had to pay."
1991-03-13	Credit Cards Back $750 Million Issue	Chase Manhattan Credit Card Trust 1991-1, established by the Chase Manhattan Corporation, is offering $750 million in asset-backed securities through Chase Securities. The debt issue is backed by Visa and Mastercard credit card receivables. The securities, which pay interest monthly, have an average life of 3.53 years and an expected final maturity of March 15, 1995, with a legal final maturity date of Nov. 15, 1997. Underwriters said interest and principal payments were supported by a letter of credit provided by the Union Bank of Switzerland. That backing gave the issues a rating of Aaa by Moody's Investors Service and AAA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
1991-03-10	"DINING OUT;
An Ambitious New Breed of Cantonese"	"EXCEPT for an enormous new yellow sign and temple lions guarding the entrance, Phoenix Garden Too still looks like the truck stop it once was. As travelers whiz along Route 46 through the Bergen County borough of Ridgefield, they may not be aware that this former diner was taken over last November by the owners of Phoenix Garden, a highly rated Cantonese restaurant in Manhattan's Chinatown. 

Despite its unlikely setting, this offspring is one of the most ambitious of the new breed of Cantonese eating places that have been opening in New Jersey. Diners who are burned out on hot and spicy Hunan and Sichuan fare and who have outgrown Chinese-American cliche dishes may be surprised to discover both the subtlety and the diversity of well-crafted, authentic Cantonese cuisine."
1991-03-10	A (Mostly) Italian Menu, Short and Sweet	IT would be difficult to envision a restaurant, other than a short-order luncheonette, in more restricted space than Bluewater Cafe in New Canaan. Further, the cafe has turned a negative into a positive, making its limited space inviting through the use of mirrors and serene paintings on sky-blue flecked white walls, soft lights, glass-topped tables, fresh flowers, candlelight and natural-wood chairs. In short, everything looks new, simple and crisply attractive. That impression is enhanced by a menu that is also small and sweet, with just a clutch of starters, salads, pastas and entrees. The accent throughout is Italian, and the emphasis is on grilled dishes, mostly seafood. By limiting choices, Bluewater Cafe can provide several dishes and do each well.
1991-03-09	Mastercard, in Turn, Names Head for U.S.	Mastercard International, not to be outdone by its rival Visa, which named a president for its American operations last month, did the same yesterday. Peter S.P. Dimsey will be the Mastercard president for the United States. The credit-card organization took the action at its annual meeting yesterday in New York, at which a plan was approved to organize the card's United States membership as one of six regions within its global structure.
1991-03-09	Your Money; Personal Finance Perplexes Many	"Many people, even those who are successful in their business or professional lives, have trouble handling personal finances, and last week Citibank co-sponsored a seminar focusing on women who want more control of their finances. Though the topic is certainly of interest to both men and women, a bank spokesman said the focus was put on women in response to numerous customer comments and requests. ""Part of it is childhood conditioning,"" said Ann B. Diamond, a chartered financial consultant, at the seminar, which was also sponsored by the New York City Commission on the Status of Women. Usually the father took care of money, she said, and few schools taught personal financial management, so many women grew up without thinking about budgeting, investing or setting financial goals. But for women who want to be self-sufficient, it is time to rectify that. Ms. Diamond outlined a simple, common-sense approach."
1991-03-06	Ameritech May Offer Credit Card	The Ameritech Corporation, the regional Bell company that provides local phone service in five Midwestern states, said yesterday that it was considering the possibility of offering a credit card and was holding discussions with potential partners. If the Chicago-based company's senior management approves the idea, Ameritech would become the first Bell regional to follow the lead of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which introduced a combination calling card and credit card nearly a year ago. Michael F. Brand, a spokesman for Ameritech, said no decision had been made.
1991-03-03	"DINING OUT;
Extensive Korean Menu in Ardsley"	"MOOL Lae Bang Ah, or Water Wheel, is the second Korean restaurant to settle in the county, and very welcome it is. The restaurant features both Korean and Japanese cuisine; but in these visits we concentrated on the Korean dishes listed on the extensive menu. Newcomers to this cuisine shouldn't be shy. First of all, the menu, written in both Korean and English, provides diners with descriptions of every dish. And second, with its Mongolian-Chinese influence, Korean food is familiar. Bite-sized meats or fish mingle with finely sliced or shredded vegetables and rice. Ginger, soy sauce, scallions and garlic season most dishes. What makes the difference, however, are the fillips of searing chilies -- sometimes added directly to a dish, sometimes mixed into a paste that can be applied to taste -- and the side dishes of briny kimchee (pickled Chinese cabbage) that appear at every meal. The range of tastes is broad, from mild and soothing to incendiary. Be sure to state your preference every time, as the kitchen's hand isn't consistent in dealing out peppery heat.

 A particular attraction at Mool Lae Bang Ah are the grills, set flush into almost every table top and all ready for the ritual of Korean barbecue, a must.  The beef was excellent and made a much better choice than chicken, which, besides having little flavor, dried out on the grill. The waiter will start the grilling process, but once it has begun, try to take over, or at least remove the meat when done to your liking. We found the waiter's continued hovering over the grill intrusive, and we didn't share his taste for well-done beef, although even that remained juicy and full of meaty flavor.Classic, hearty soups are treated like main dishes here; find them hidden among the entree listings.  To be sure, Korean soups can be meals in themselves; simply add a bowl of rice. We enjoyed dumplings and rice cake slices in a full-flavored, soothing broth (duk mandoo guk)."

Is Every Blast From the Past A Classic?"	"The Museum of Broadcasting's series ""James Dean: The Television Work"" ended yesterday, but the fact that the programs are part of the permanent collection should be greeted with cheers by those inclined to revel without a cause. 

In an early commercial, the star literally pops up as a mute lindy-hopping partygoer begging an insipid hostess for a Pepsi. During ""A Triumphant Hour Sponsored by the Family Rosary Crusade,"" he plays an inexplicably pouty John the Beloved Disciple. For about a minute in one of yesterday's ""Tales of Tomorrow,"" an eerily familiar laboratory assistant can be seen blinking from behind a pair of sissy glasses. Watching these selections from James Dean's television oeuvre makes one long for the artistic depth of ""Leave It to Beaver."""
1991-03-03	Old-Fashioned Charm, Bounteous Platters	"IT is too bad Gail's Station House Restaurant and Bakery can't clone itself over and over again. In addition to a spot next to the train station in West Redding, Gail's has added a Ridgefield location inside a former grocery store. But this kind of cozy and comfortable hangout should be in every Connecticut town. The high walls are decorated with old hats and framed pages from old children's books. Then there is the tin ceiling, the natural wood floors, inlaid wood tables and mismatched chairs. The nostalgic feeling that Gail's evokes makes it especially cheerful and inviting at breakfast on weekdays and even more so on Sundays. Even the type of breakfast served adds to the old-fashioned feeling. Fresh-squeezed orange juice, pancakes, French toast, hash browns, eggs and bacon, house-made muffins and scones, Canadian bacon and sausage are the stock in trade. In addition, Gail's offers three hearty ""skillet specials"" -- a full meal served in the black cast-iron skillet in which it was cooked. Each skillet meal features scrambled eggs cooked over red-skinned hash-brown potatoes with a special topping. The special called Texas pink included jalapeno peppers, salsa, sour cream and a wedge of pink grapefruit. Also appealing to anyone with a hearty appetite was Barney's breakfast: a layer of melted cheese, a thick slice of Canadian bacon and an English muffin. Blueberry pancakes consisted of three generous pancakes overflowing with blueberries, with real maple syrup. The banana-pecan, cinnamon-apple, corn and cheddar versions were equally appealing."
1991-02-26	Sears Backed on Visa; Banks Grow Concerned	A Federal court has ruled that Sears, Roebuck & Company can issue Visa cards, and the move is expected to intensify competition in the credit card business, which is already being reshaped by the entry of companies other than banks. In a ruling in Salt Lake City on Friday, Judge David Sam of United States District Court granted a preliminary injunction against Visa U.S.A. Inc. that permitted Sears to issue Visa cards pending the resolution of a lawsuit Sears has against Visa.
1991-02-25	First Chicago Revokes Credit Cards	The First Chicago Corporation said it had revoked thousands of credit cards held by residents of nine Northeastern states as part of a credit review of the economically weakened region. The acknowledgement by First Chicago, the nation's third-largest issuer of credit cards, prompted a Massachusetts Congressman to demand that the Bush Administration investigate whether the region was the victim of economic discrimination.

Hearty and Homey Cuisine in Peekskill"	"THE cozy Americana that the designers of this eatery chose has weathered well over the last few years since its opening. The painted checkerboard floors show the tread of many diners, the brass patina on the bathroom faucets is wearing thin, and the place in general has taken on a lived-in, comfortable look. And the food comforts as well. It's not quite Mom's -- no mashed potatoes -- but dishes are hearty, vegetables plentiful and nicely prepared, and very much in evidence are the kitchen's efforts to employ fresh ingredients in tempting ways.

Although there is much to admire in the cooking, other aspects of this operation need tending to: service can sometimes be laughably inept, pacing nonexistent, the bar crowd noisy and tobacco smoke intrusive. These flaws, in fact, keep it from the higher rating the food often approaches. Nonetheless, prices are moderate, and the specials' board in particular offers good food and good value."
1991-02-24	Mongolian-Style Barbecue for the Family	IN these budget-watching times, it's refreshing to find an attractive new restaurant offering family dining that is both inexpensive and enjoyable. Atilla's -- on the Fairfield-Westport line, in the building formerly occupied by a restaurant called East Coast -- fills the bill with Mongolian barbecue. While grill or fire cooking is traditional in Central Asia, Atilla's has added a new twist -- a buffet table, where diners can sample a range of appetizers before embarking on their grilled, all-you-can-eat meal. Here's how it works. First, tea is poured, then a choice of soup is offered. We found the freshly made hot and sour soup well balanced between spicy and tart. Wonton soup, a clear broth with two wontons afloat, was a respectable alternative.
1991-02-23	How Students Can Benefit From Credit Cards	"To the Editor: In ""Banks Try to Make Students Loan Junkies"" (letter, Jan. 24), a father whose son had been solicited for a credit card expressed fear that such solicitations might encourage students to take on more debt than they can handle, harming both the cardholder and the soliciting bank. It is unfortunate that the father discounted the value to a college student of owning a credit card."

Dinkins for renaming upper Second Avenue in Manhattan Farfalle Boulevard, as the tally of hip trattorias in the 70's and 80's exceeds the number of fire hydrants. Even as the restaurant business withers in New York City, these pastel pasta factories continue to sprout.
1991-02-21	American Express Product	"The American Express Company, taking direct aim at Visa and Mastercard, said yesterday that it would market a new corporate ""gold"" card with some unusual features. The features, aimed at chief executives of small businesses and senior officers at large companies, include a 24-hour ""executive service desk"" that can plan meetings, deliver messages and replace lost visas and passports."
1991-02-18	Small Business Adapts to Lean Times	When Richard Mecaskey bought the Reliable Auto Paint and Supply Company last April, the former steel company executive figured that his new venture in the Cleveland suburb of Maple Heights was recession-proof. The tougher things get, he was told, the more inclined people would be to take their cars to the repair shops, like those served by Reliable, instead of buying new ones. It has not worked out that way. Not only are consumers holding back on new purchases, but renovations and repairs are being put off, and those that are being done are frequently paid for more slowly. One result is that the small businesses on the economic frontline are shifting at least some of their woes to companies like Mr. Mecaskey's by falling behind on payments for supplies or services.
1991-02-16	Citibank Joins Teller Network	Citibank, which for years refused to allow other banks' customers to use its automated teller machines in the New York area, announced yesterday that it would join the Cirrus network. On Cirrus, 7,200 banks and financial institutions in the United States and overseas share access to their machines. The move means that Citibank customers will have access to machines in the Cirrus system and Citibank machines will be open to customers of other banks in the system. Networks of automated teller machines, operated though national and worldwide systems like Cirrus, or smaller regional systems like the New York Cash Exchange, allow consumers to handle many ordinary banking activities away from their local bank.
1991-02-09	Credit Cards Become Big Part of Campus Life	"Most college students agree that getting a credit card these days is easier than passing a exam or qualifying for a student loan. ""I photocopied my student ID, filled out the application and sent it in,"" said Tony Sierra, a senior at the University of Maine at Orono. ""That was all it took."""
1991-02-08	Restaurants	On the capacious ethnic buffet that is New York City, Korean cuisine is only a small, inconspicuous platter. That may be because there are relatively few Korean restaurants in town or because the food remains mysterious and intimidating to the average diner. A fine introduction to this colorful and salubrious cooking can be found at Woo Chon in midtown's Little Korea along West 36th Street. Korea's centuries-old culinary tradition emphasizes health as well as harmonious flavors. The essential seasonings in every meal are green onions, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds and oil. Every table also has an array of kim chee, which are pickled vegetables or seafood, most commonly cabbage, turnip, cucumber, squid and octopus. There are more than 100 types of kim chee, and in Korea there is even a museum devoted to it. The basic meal includes steamed rice, a hot soup, kim chee and a number of meat, seafood or vegetable dishes. Fruit is always served for dessert.
1991-02-03	"DINING OUT;
Improvements Make a Visit Worthwhile"	"THE former bank building next to the A. & P. shopping center on Elm Street in Westfield, Union County, is a far cry from the tiny storefront just a few blocks away that was the first home of Ken Marcotte, the well-rated restaurant named for the chef-owner. 

Mr. Marcotte's first restaurant grew out of his catering business and seated only 34 people. When he moved into larger premises he acquired enough space to seat several times that number, which was a problem in the beginning. There are now several dining rooms on two levels, and the distance between kitchen and dining tables was perhaps reason enough to make the service as slow as molasses. The food, too, was affected by the increased numbers as Mr. Marcotte went through several unsatisfactory sous-chefs whose culinary efforts were often far below his standards."

Old-Fashioned Italian Menu in Armonk"	"SITUATED in the spot last occupied by Raphael's, Onda Blu has changed little of the established decor. Cool Art Deco colors and greenery set an attractive, if somewhat bare contemporary backdrop for an old-fashioned menu of Italian dishes most diners will find familiar. 

 If in general the food at this neighborhood eating spot seemed less than sensational, it was at worst not terrible; but efforts varied from visit to visit and ranged from quite good to ho-hum. And the generous spirit of the service was reflected in the more than generous portions. In addition, diners looking for bargains have several special menus worth considering and should note the details in our information box."
1991-02-01	Diner's Journal	"Mesa Grill It is as if New Yorkers, who have endured a heap of distressing news lately, are looking for something mirthful, even a bit zany, to break up the clouds. At least that may in part account for the first-week crush at Mesa Grill, the Southwestern restaurant in the loftlike space formerly occupied by Sofi, on Fifth Avenue near 15th Street in Manhattan. Gone are Sofi's cushy upholstered chairs and dramatic paintings, replaced by red vinyl banquettes with a cowboy-and-cactus motif, eerie yellow green chairs and perforated aluminum lights that look like innovative cheese graters. Jerome Kretchmer (of Gotham Bar and Grill), one of the principals, has teamed up with Bobby Flay, the former chef at Miracle Grill. At this early date, his cooking is as colorful as a desert sunset, and well focused. Those expecting jalapenos won't find them; various peppers here are employed for accent, not injury. A vibrant starter is the grilled tuna tostada, with a well-grilled slice of tuna atop brassy black beans, a crisp flour tortilla and julienne of cooling jicama and mango ($8.50). The quesadilla of goat cheese, tomato and basil is tasty ($7.50), as is the terrific tamale holding moist cornmeal, shrimp and roasted garlic ($8.50). Among main courses, grilled swordfish is exceptionally moist and delicious served with cilantro pesto and well-seasoned vegetables ($19); grilled strip steak is well turned out, accompanied by a mildly spicy red chili mustard and straw potatoes ($19.50). Only the grilled pork chops were dry ($16.50). All of the desserts sampled were satisfying: pistachio devil's food cake, a creme brulee-like raspberry custard, and gingerbread ice cream sandwich (each $6). While Mesa Grill can be recommended for its titillating food, there is one caveat: the place is so loud it could knock a buckaroo off his mount at 50 paces. Mesa Grill, 102 Fifth Avenue, near 15th Street, serves lunch from 11:45 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Monday to Friday, dinner 5:30 to 11 P.M. Monday to Saturday. Closed Sunday. American Express, Mastercard and Visa accepted. Telephone: (212) 807-7400. Caffe Vivaldi On a recent Arctic evening in Greenwich Village when oranges at sidewalk fruit stands ossified into boccie balls, we sought quick refuge in Caffe Vivaldi, at 32 Jones Street, just off Bleecker Street. The scene was as restorative as a country parlor: marble tables, a flaming hearth, classical music, an espresso bar and pastry displays. Most of the vaguely bohemian-looking clientele -- people even read there -- come for one of the assorted coffees, which include cappuccino ($2.50), espresso with Sambuca ($3.50), latte macchiato (glass of steamed milk stained with espresso, $2.50), caffe mocha (espresso, cocoa, steamed milk and whipped cream, $3.25) and caffe Viennese (double espresso, vanilla essence and whipped cream, $3.50). Also available are sandwiches, salad platters and ice creams. The dessert selection is extensive, although the lightweight tiramisu ($4.50) and the ultrarich chocolate mousse cake ($4.50) were unremarkable. Caffe Vivaldi serves from 11 A.M. to 2 A.M. daily. No credit cards. Telephone: (212) 929-9384). The Changing Scene NEW CHEF: San Domenico, the luxury Italian restaurant at 240 Central Park South in Manhattan, has a new chef: Theo Schoenegger, who has been an executive with the Tony May Group, the owner of San Domenico, for two years. Before that, he owned a restaurant in the Italian Alps. He replaces Paul Bartolotta. MENU ADDITION: Alison on Dominick Street, the French restaurant at 38 Dominick Street in TriBeCa, has begun a Sunday evening family-style dinner priced at $49 for two. It includes a tureen of soup; a whole roast chicken with garlic, potatoes and vegetables, and tarte Tatin. Reservations are necessary: (212) 727-1188. OPENINGS: Ed Debevic's, the wacky 1950's-style diner that is a landmark in Chicago (and now has branches in six other cities), is coming to Manhattan on Feb. 11, at 661 Broadway, between Bleecker and Bond Streets. The 15,000-square-foot restaurant will include a 1940's style bar, a ""bomb shelter"" party room, a ""1960's coffee house"" and a staff dressed up like ""greasers, jocks, prom queens, nerds and cheerleaders,"" according to Richard Melman, the creator of Ed Debevic's. The down-home food, like fried chicken and meatloaf, is expected to cost less than $10 a meal, Mr. Melman said. . . .

Sears said in papers filed Jan. 16 in Federal court in Salt Lake City that it hopes to offer Visa cards to six million consumers beginning in March. The cards are to be issued through MountainWest Financial, a former savings and loan association in Sandy, Utah, acquired by Sears last year from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that disposes of failed savings institutions.

Discreet Charm of Japanese in Scarsdale"	"NO sprawling sign indicates this restaurant's presence, and the few discreet characters in Japanese and bit of bamboo and rice paper in the storefront window can easily go unnoticed. Nonetheless, Gyosai attracts a steady flow of diners who have discovered that this is the place to enjoy a superior and impressive variety of spectacularly fresh fish, beautifully cut for sushi, sashimi and the large number of snack-sized dishes this restaurant offers. 

 Unless diners know their way around a Japanese menu -- and Gyosai's is particularly confusing -- ordering could be difficult. But to simplify selecting, a book of photographs showing almost every dish this restaurant prepares is circulated with the menu. Apart from their value as graphic description, the photographs also help size up a portion, as price does not necessarily indicate quantity. For example, of a dish sometimes called dancing shrimp -- a rare treat -- our small sampling of two scooped live from a tank, grilled in the shell (so fragile it's edible) and served simply with lemon cost about $10. On the other hand, a deluxe combination platter of gorgeous sushi and sashimi that goes for $45 is enough for four or a hungry three to share."
1991-01-27	V.A.T.	"To the Editor: Jean Gerlach's complaint (Letters, Nov. 18) regarding the lack of a V.A.T. refund in Ireland reminded me of our visit in 1989 to a Naf Naf store near St. Eustache in Paris where we spent several hundred dollars and charged it to our MasterCard. The clerk completed the refund papers for us and imprinted my card on a credit voucher. At the airport our forms were completed by the Customs officials and we mailed them back to the store. Six months later, however, after a letter to the store and two faxes to the president of Naf Naf in Paris, we still had not received the refund. It was only thanks to our bank, First USA, that we finally got our money. (Forms mailed the same day to Galleries Lafayette were processed immediately.) This summer when we landed in Stockholm, we inquired at the airport about their rules, which were similar to the rules in France, so we felt there would be no problem. However, we were traveling by train to Oslo and flying home from there, so where would we present our purchases? The answer was Oslo. There, we were told, we would receive our refund -- in dollars. But the outcome was a bit different. At the Oslo airport, in the main hall, with both Swedish and Norwegian refund forms, we were given one new voucher for all the old ones and told to go to a certain store in the gate area, where we were given Norwegian kroner at a point beyond the last bank and in a ""duty-free"" shop that charged exorbitant prices. We were astonished that the Norwegian Government would allow us to depart with such a poor impression of their country. NORMAN A. ROSS New York, N.Y. A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Tourist Board in New York replies: Mr. Ross could have left the security area and returned to the main hall to exchange his kroner for dollars and then gone through the security gate a second time. At the other main airport in Norway, the bank is next to the V.A.T. exchange post, and we hope that that system will be adopted in Oslo. We do feel that it is an advantage for visitors to Norway to receive their V.A.T. refunds before leaving the country and not have to wait for the refund to be mailed to the United States."

1991-01-23	MNC Financial Spins Off Credit Card Unit	Unable to fetch an attractive price for its credit card business in a private transaction, the parent of Maryland National Bank spun off 85 percent of the subsidiary yesterday in an initial public offering valued at $861.6 million. While the company did not realize as much in the deal as management had once hoped, it was above the threshold that the troubled parent company had determined it needed to repay coming debt obligations and satisfy banking regulators. The outcome of the offering was at least partly a function of the market rally kindled last week by early American successes in the Persian Gulf war, analysts and investors said yesterday. Under the deal, which was underwritten by Goldman, Sachs & Company, investors paid $22.50 a share for 38.3 million shares, representing an 85 percent stake in the MBNA Corporation, as the credit-card operation, based in Newark, Del., is now known. Of those shares, 27.7 million were sold by MNC Financial, the Baltimore-based parent company, and 10.6 million new shares were issued by MBNA.

Housing costs have always caused severe hardships for the poor, whose plight deepened in the 80's. But now the debate has broadened to include middle-income and affluent households, some of whom may have stretched their budgets too far in recent home purchases."
1991-01-20	Chinese Fare With a Moderate Hand	WHEN Chan's Choice opened in Norwalk some years ago, we sampled its cuisine and decided to give it more time before reviewing it. Since then, the tiny storefront restaurant has developed a loyal following. Since our last visit, there have been some changes. The space is the same, but knotty-pine paneling now separates the entrance from the dining area, and the walls have become display areas with bamboo and rattan shelves, mirrors and Chinese knickknacks. More substantially, the restaurant now features, in addition to its regular menu, five daily specials (usually fresh seafood) that are listed on a portable blackboard.
1991-01-19	Guidepost; Pick a Card. Any Card?	Most interest rates are declining, but three-quarters of all credit-card holders will not reap the benefit. The reason: their interest rates are fixed and rarely change. To find lower rates, they must shop around. The remaining quarter of all credit cards offer variable interest rates, usually tied to the prime rate. Last year the average cost of financing purchases on a standard fixed-rate Visa card or Mastercard was 18.86 percent. The Bank Rate Monitor, an industry weekly, says these three banks offer the best deals on credit cards in the country, taking into account interest rates, annual fees and grace periods before interest charges are added.

The latest to arrive is Gandhi, in Ridgeway Shopping Center space that was formerly occupied by Bonani (which has moved farther downtown, on Summer Street). Gandhi, a storefront restaurant has kept Bonani's Indian motifs and has created the illusion of spaciousness by using smaller tables. The menu will look comfortingly familiar to those who like Indian food; it has an ample assortment of lamb, beef, seafood, biryani rice and vegetarian dishes. One puzzling category, though, is ""tandoori superb,"" featuring several tandoori dishes; the puzzle stems from the fact that the restaurant has no tandoor oven."

1991-01-06	In Chester, A French Village Restaurant	YEARS ago, in the center of Chester, the main floor of a small frame house was transformed into an outpost of France. Spotless, stylish and simple, that was Restaurant du Village. The same adjectives describe the new Restaurant du Village, which was, as of 1990, owned by Alsatian chef Michel Keller and his American chef-wife, Cynthia. Much remains the same. You walk through a brick-lined courtyard beside the building, enter a cozy taproom and then the one-room dining area, which resembles a restaurant in a French village. The decor is all white, with subtle, romantic track lighting overhead and Villeroy & Boch china of the Vieux Luxembourg pattern as well as a fresh floral arrangement on each well-napped table (a single transgression: dishwasher-spotted glasses). Excellent service joins a small menu of mostly hearty country dishes.

Sampling Thai Food That's Easy to Like"	"AFTER the richness and formality of holiday meals, the lighter food of Thailand, served in a relaxed setting, holds a good deal of appeal -- especially when the prices are reasonable. It has been slow to take off, but Thai cuisine, with its contrasts of sweet and sour, hot and cool, is finally piquing the interest of New Jersey diners at the handful of family-run storefront restaurants that have recently opened.

One of the newest and most attractive of these is Tuptim, on the Essex County town of Montclair's main street. Instead of the typical mom and pop enterprise, this is a brother and sister act operated by Lek Pattanasombat, the chef, and his sister, Sheree, who is the hostess."
1990-12-21	Restaurants	"The cooking at Vince and Eddie's is being compared to Grandma's, or Mother's, depending on your last birthday. No matter. The comparison conjures up feel-good adjectives like hearty, simple, warm, comforting. But it never answers the question ""Could your grandmother (or mother) really cook?"" Did her roast chicken have a crisp golden skin and moist white meat? Or did she boil the life out of the bird to make soup and then roast it until straw tasted better? Did she mash her potatoes with butter and milk, or did she mix the flakes with boiling water? Vince and Eddie's version of home cooking falls somewhere in between. The mashed potatoes are real; sometimes they are buttery and hot, sometimes neither. The defensive linebacker's portion of roast chicken is golden but dry."

In Harrison, Culinary Simplicity for the 90's"	"DINERS expecting to find traces of the old Jillyflowers at this address will be disappointed. Our visit early last summer found this kitchen turning out respectable dishes very much in the old tradition; recently, however, less-skilled hands are at work. Culinary excitement, as well as opulent bouquets, have vanished with the affluent 80's. Mo's Jillyflowers, the new occupant, seems to be preparing for a lean and mean 90's, and the food has declined with the economy. 

These days the restaurant is simple, even stark. Once an oasis in a gustatory desert, the place now offers fare not much better than one can order at other eateries in this town. Some of the recommended dishes are the results of our experience on our summer visit, and whether this kitchen can repeat its success now is questionable. But notable exceptions to these caveats can be found among the desserts, a few of them remarkable not only for their puzzling contrast with some of the mediocre dishes of other courses but also for their lusciousness and high quality."

After all, if First Chicago traded at $35 a share in the last year on the strength of its leading market position in the Middle West, then at its current price below $20, the stock is surely a bargain. That, at least, might be an argument on behalf of the company. But to hear most Wall Street analysts tell it, First Chicago is anything but a buy and should probably be sold short in anticipation of further price declines."

1990-12-07	Restaurants	Ridiculous, you say, to open an expensive restaurant at the end of 1990? Diners are counting their pennies, restaurants are trading down. Why spend $45 for a fixed-price meal when you can eat at one of the new bistros for $30 or less? Why? Let me count the ways: One year into the less-is-more-restaurant style, and you are already tired of giving your money to surly waiters who act as if they are doing you a favor; you can't stand another serving of cold mashed potato; you want to see coats and ties instead of torn T-shirts. If you are nodding yes, then you might want to think about March, a tiny jewel box of a town house on 58th Street in Manhattan between Sutton Place and First Avenue.
1990-12-05	A.T.&T. Extends Card's No-Fee Plan	The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said it was extending for 85 days its promise never to charge an annual fee to customers who sign up for its Universal card. Customers who apply for the card by next March 26 and use the card at least once a year will never pay an annual fee, A.T.& T. said. The previous deadline for applications had been Dec. 31. The Universal card is a combination of a Mastercard or Visa credit card with an A.T.& T. Calling Card. The telecommunications giant introduced the card on March 26 of this year and has opened about 4.1 million accounts. Card holders have charged $3.3 billion in purchases and telephone calls to the Universal card, the company said.
1990-12-03	A.T.&T. Strained by a Success	The American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Universal card has been a bigger success than the company ever anticipated -- and that is exactly the problem. Consumer demand for the card was so heavy after its introduction in March that A.T.& T. was unprepared to handle the millions of applications. The result was delays, billing errors and other problems that irritated some customers and led some to cancel their cards.
1990-12-02	Southern Style Cooking of Bygone Days	IF your memories head south when you think of home cooking, Central Islip's Southern Taste Restaurant will be a nostalgia trip. Bygone days come along with the fried chicken, collard greens, fried okra, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie. Southern Taste will never be mistaken for the fabled Greenbrier in West Virginia or the Williamsburg Inn. It is a modest spot with woodgrain Formica tables and paper napkins.
1990-12-01	Visa's Issuers Must Be Banks	Visa U.S.A., a trade group of banks that oversees the Visa credit card program, announced yesterday that it had temporarily barred financial institutions owned by non-banking companies from setting up Visa card programs. The ban will last until June 4, 1991, and is intended to allow the trade group to review its membership requirements and determine whether changes are needed to protect the investments banks have made in building the system, Visa U.S.A. said. Existing issuers of Visa cards will not be directly affected.
1990-11-30	Restaurants	Could two adjoining dining rooms in the same restaurant be under different management? Patrons banished to the back room at tres chic, tres French Le Comptoir must walk through the front dining room and up a few steps to reach it. Once they have crossed that great divide, they might as well be in a restaurant on the other side of town. Waiters in the back answer questions with a Gallic shrug. The food is overcooked, underseasoned and carelessly prepared. Smokers are seated next to nonsmokers.
1990-11-23	RESTAURANTS	"Charles Palmer, the executive chef and part owner of Aureole in on the East Side of Manhattan, wanted to have more than one restaurant. A keen observer of the dining scene and a fine cook, he understands what many have learned the hard way: with few exceptions, being a chef and owner of a multi-star restaurant and being a multi-restaurant mogul are mutually exclusive. Mr. Palmer thought he had arrived at a solution: part ownership of a place where he and like-minded professionals could wind down at the ""chef's table"" after a long day over their respective hot ranges. There would be supervision -- from a distance -- but others would be in charge. Mr. Palmer found four chefs with the same idea, and together they opened Chefs Cuisiniers Club in September."
1990-11-21	Anticipating Jitters, Not Jingling	Store executives across the nation, anticipating a disappointing Christmas season beginning Friday, have already cut back on merchandise and held big sales. But a few, seeing a glimmer of hope in their early November sales, say the situation is so uncertain that results could end up being much better than predicted. Many stores, having looked hard at the stuttering sales of recent months, are not taking any chances. To try to seize control early, chains ranging from Nordstrom to Sears and from Saks to Woolworth have in recent weeks reduced the number of items they keep in stock and cut their non-sales staffs.
1990-11-18	A Mexican Menu That Turns Up the Heat	WHEN Azteca's opened in New Haven early in 1986, it served the usual Tex-Mex fare with a few tentative renderings of Southwestern dishes. Through the years, the chef and co-owner, Lynne DeLeo, has expanded her repertoire and pushed up the spice thermometer. In the process, a restaurant rated Good now merits Excellent. The basic menu has not changed much, amply showcasing the expected Tex-Mex favorites. But what gives Azteca's its pizazz is the pink list of six special entrees and three appetizers. The first-time diner will best experience Azteca's inventiveness by concentrating on the specials, for they are where the chef's creativity really radiates. Some starters are so innovative you might wish to order two or three of them as your dinner -- but that would slight the entree specials. Obviously, the answer is to plan return visits.

1990-11-11	"DINING OUT;
Pasta and Fish, Italian Style, in Yonkers"	"STELLA DI MARE is not just another Italian restaurant. This newcomer has already captured a clientele enthusiastic not only for nicely prepared pasta dishes but also for the many splendidly fresh fish offerings in which this dining spot specializes. Thus it is of little surprise that, in delicious compatibility, a partner in this new enterprise is also the owner of the fish shop next door. Our conservative rating reflects the kitchen's occasional tendency to oversalt; we recommend that when placing an order one reminds the kitchen to use a light hand with that seasoning. 

The menu is loaded with fish and shellfish items, with more recited from a list of daily specials. To know what to expect, check the window of the Highridge Fishery next door before entering the restaurant. While fresh fish often is not enough, the offerings at Stella di Mare are; and, in addition, they are timed carefully and embellished suitably, if not lavishly, with luscious strips of shiitake mushrooms appearing with welcome frequency.

One might begin a meal with a plate of tasty shellfish -- green-shelled New Zealand mussels, baby little necks and the elusive razor clams. Or have shrimp cocktail; these pink and white jumbos don't come better. 

 Piscators can move happily to entrees starring the clear-tasting sea creatures. A hefty steak, not a thin fillet, fullfilled our order for grilled salmon, and a thick slab of moist, ivory-fleshed swordfish arrived in Champagne sauce, festooned with capers (an ingredient the chef seems to favor sometimes too enthusiastically) and minced shallots.  Perfectly cooked sea scallops were somewhat overwhelmed by a rich sauce of pure heavy cream flavored with a dash of Cognac and saffron. Prepared in any way the diner pleases, remarkably tender calamari is always on hand. Ordering from the menu, we enjoyed this sea mollusk stuffed and, on another visit, in the daunting Lucifero style, that is, cooked in its ink and served whole -- tentacles and all. Prepare to find ingenuous presentations.

 And consider ordering one of the daily specials.  We were more than pleased with sweet, delicate orange roughi and pompano, well-matched with Jamaican rum sauce but unceremoniously heaped with shellfish. 

 Entrees other than fish received proper treatment as well. Our request for dark instead of white meat honored, chicken Portofino turned out to be a sumptuous concoction, with shiitake mushrooms, bits of prosciutto and minced shallots bound by a sauce of cream, and port and Cognac moistening the butterflied, pounded collops of chicken. Sliced filet mignon in red wine arrived with perfect rareness, as ordered.

 In large or small portions, pasta items also deserve attention. A generous dollop of black caviar garnished a dish of penne under a glistening sauce of tomato-pinked cream thinned with a shot of vodka. And chunks of tomato and mildly spicy chili pepper showered rigatoni in the style arrabbiata, a substantial, satisfying dish, as was fusilli alla Siciliana, with eggplant, olives and tomatoes. Diners who can take the richness should look for the special spaghetti with lobster and tomato sauce. 

 Fresh strawberries ended the meal nicely. Otherwise, a frothy, freshly made-to-order zabaglione was once perfectly balanced but on another occasion clobbered with the almondy flavor of Marsala. Those with a taste for the dry variety of homemade cheesecake might like Stella di Mare's. 

 A three-course dinner averages $29 without drinks, tax and tip.

1990-11-11	"DINING OUT;
A Decent Meal by Choosing Carefully"	"A RESTAURANT'S appearance sets up certain expections. So when a meal in a elaborately decorated restaurant, with a fancy menu, extensive wine list and elegantly attired servers, comes up short, it is a greater disappointment than it would be in a more simple establishment.

Cafe Royale, which opened in March in the upscale Tricorne Shopping Center near the A. & P. Future Store in Wall Township, is a case in point. The restaurant is reminiscent of the 1930's with old rose-colored carpet and banquettes, frosted glass panels etched with swans, an ornate fountain in the center of the dining room, fresh freesias on the pristinely napped tables and servers in black tie. There is also a piano bar where, until recently, Ray Noble's nephew Bud played incredible music. Joseph Cinderella is now the pianist. 

The elaborate menu is not inexpensive; an average three-course meal without tax, tip or beverage is about $32. That made it all the more disappointing one night when neither the food nor the service lived up to the expectations raised on entering the unexpectedly elaborate restaurant. 

Actually, our first visit was better than our second. The fact that the headwaiter was on vacation may well have contributed to the disorganized manner in which we were served the second time. The only consistent service then was from our busboy. In fact, we had to ask him several times to get our waiter so that we could either order or be served.

Even though the execution of the food may not live up to the menu, one can have a decent meal here by choosing carefully. There are several dishes I would happily order again. For instance, coquille St. Jacques (scallops), perfectly prepared a la Parisienne with cream and mushrooms, was served in a shell-shaped pastry plate. Crepes Royale was two thin crepes, served warm, containing chunks of smoked salmon coated with egg cream sauce and a touch of caviar. The two slices of smooth ultra-rich duck pate topped with aspic and served with a sweet Cumberland sauce were also good, as was the simple lump crab meat cocktail with two sauces. 

Baked oysters topped with crab meat and cheese were unappealing, as was the half-moon pasta with ham and mushrooms, which suffered from an overkill of raw garlic. Shrimp and crab meat bisque was acceptable but not exciting, and a grilled quail would have been good if only it had a modicum of seasoning, because the mixed salad with black currant vinaigrette served with it was very good. 

Main courses were the big disappointment. Three lamb chops were accurately cooked and well prepared, as was the tortellini with a spicy sauce containing spinach and ham. 

Dover sole, served on the bone as requested, was slightly overcooked when sauteed meuniere with butter and lemon as listed on the menu. But on another occasion, when we asked that it be broiled without sauce, it was overcooked to the point where it was hard and the edges were charred.

Duck with orange was greasy and had a precooked flavor , and tournedos Henri IV, a classical preparation that's supposed to be served with an artichoke bottom and bearnaise sauce, tasted as though it were topped with a minuscule amount of a cheese-flavored sauce. A boneless chicken breast rolled around lobster and baked, then sliced and served with an herb sauce, was not to my taste, but was enjoyed by the person who ordered it. 

One of the desserts, which on the whole were very good, was an apple strudel with rancid walnuts. When we told the waiter, his comment was, ""You mean you don't like it?"" That was obviously not the point; we were trying to let him know something was wrong, but his comment seemed to be indicative of a certain attitude. The price of the dessert was not removed from the check. 

But desserts worth ordering are the lemon meringue cheesecake, a chocolate mousse cake with either orange or raspberry filling and the crepes suzette prepared at the table.

The wine list is small but comprehensive and very well priced. It ranged from $10 for either a Mateus or Lancers rose to $165 for a Chateau Lafite Rothschild Premier Cru Classic. But vintages were not marked, even on the higher-priced bottles.

PROBLEMS with mail-order merchandise? Deal with the company first. If you do not receive satisfaction, call a government consumer affairs agency in the city where the merchandise was purchased. If this does not work, here are some other places to turn (always send a written complaint and copies of all correspondence). One organization that has been successful in settling complaints is the Direct Marketing Association's Mail Order Action Line, 6 East 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. You can also contact the Better Business Bureau, either in your area or where the mail-order company is based. If you think the company has acted fraudulently you can ask your local postmaster to turn your complaint over to the postal inspection service. The Federal Trade Commission can be helpful for problems with mail orders or other orders paid for by check through the mail. But it cannot regulate orders placed by telephone that are charged to a credit card. Companies are required by the Government to ship merchandise within 30 days of receiving payment. If it cannot fill the order on time it must notify the customer, and offer a refund or the opportunity to cancel. Complaints should be sent to the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580."

Cuisine That's in Tune With the Seasons"	"THERE'S nothing more inviting on a crisp autumn day than to tuck into a satisfying meal at a cozy country inn, and Pennsylvania's Bucks County has more than its share of atmospheric eating places. Most of them are dotted along the Delaware River, but Sign of the Sorrel Horse is hidden down a back lane in the northwest corner of the county on the fringe of Lake Nockamixon State Park. 

This quaint little stone inn, built by the side of the road in 1749 as a stagecoach stop, would be easy to miss. In fact, is is not a place you casually drop into, not only because of the location but also because of its substantial menu prices. And, with seating in two snug dining rooms for only 40, reservations are essential. When booking a table, by the way, it pays to inquire about the chef's unusually interesting specials since some of them must be ordered ahead. Plan on devoting the evening to a meal here since the service is leisurely at best."
1990-11-04	Feasts & Celebrations; Supper Clubs: Taking Guests On the Town	THE STEAMY INCANDESCENCE OF nightlife in the 1980's seems ready to mellow to the soft glow of candelabra in the 90's. The over-25 crowd has all but abandoned those warehouses with decibel ranges approximating Boeing-jet test laboratories. Instead, they seek venues offering more intimacy, more style and, above all, comfort. This new genre of club-restaurants -- updated versions of the supper clubs of the 30's and 40's -- is taking root in such citiesas New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington. Among the first of these clubs were Nell's and MK in Manhattan, which opened in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Both have cushy lounges with parlorlike atmospheres on one floor, and dancing on another. Their success has spawned, in New York, Au Bar, The Living Room, Delia's and, most recently, The Grolier Club. In these and others, cocktails and dinner can precede dancing or live music. Some are in roomy town houses, others are one big room.
1990-11-02	MBNA's Offering To Yield 8.938%	The MBNA 90-B Trust, established by MBNA America, a unit of MNC Financial, is making a $600 million global offering of certificates backed by Mastercard credit card receivables through Merrill Lynch & Company. The certificates carry a coupon of 8 3/4 percent and are priced at 99.59375 to yield 8.938 percent, or about 110 basis points more than the when-issued three-year Treasury note. The certificates are rated Aaa by Moody's and AAA by Standard & Poor's, partly on the strength of the underlying credit card receivables and a 10 percent letter of credit issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland as additional support for the financing. MBNA stands for Maryland Bank, N.A.
1990-10-30	American Express in Pact on Long-Distance Phone Calls	The American Express Company waded yesterday into the bitter credit card marketing skirmishes between the nation's largest banks and the nation's biggest telephone company. American Express said its card could be used to place long-distance calls through the MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company. The carriers will offer a 10 percent discount from their regular calling-card rates, the same discount that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company provides for its Universal credit card. Review Sought by Banks The Universal card is a Mastercard or Visa card that is sponsored by A.T.&T. and combines the features of a general-purpose credit card and a telephone calling card. The nation's leading banks have asked regulators to review the legality of A.T.&T.'s sponsorship, have adopted rules to prevent any more non-banks from issuing Visa cards, have added long-distance calling features to their own cards and have even shifted a little of their own long-distance business away from A.T.&T.
1990-10-28	"DINING OUT;
A Good Beginning at a Country Inn"	"SOME restaurants remain in the hands of the same person for many years, while others acquire new owners on a regular basis. Recently, the 175-year-old Carversville Inn in Bucks County fitted into the second category, having had at least four owners in the last seven years.

It is now owned by Will Mathias, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, and his wife, Denise, who acquired the inn a year ago. The Mathiases have done little to change the decor. It remains a simple yet charming old country inn with four rather dimly lighted dining rooms.

The restaurant is a little off the beaten track, but the easiest way to get there appears to be to take Route 202 south of New Hope and turn right half a mile past the Holiday Inn at Aquetong Road. The Carversville Inn is at the junction of that road and Carversville Road."
1990-10-28	Shore Dinners for Ample Appetites	ENTERTAINING MOMENTS -- the restaurant group that brought Bruxelles, Scoozzi, Three Sixty Eight and Gentree to New Haven -- has now ventured a few miles northeast to Guilford with a new place called Schooner's. Judging by the packed houses on our several visits, the same know-how that made the other places such roaring successes is working its magic here. Schooner's is not a clone of past triumphs. Its plain, down-home shore-dinner atmosphere, menu and food might disappoint patrons expecting trendy dishes and the Bruxelles-Scoozzi innovations. Schooner's, as its name suggests, is of the sea, which is fitting, as it is at the very end of Whitfield Street near the water's edge and across from the Guilford municipal docks. It replaces the long-familiar Little Stone House restaurant, a mainstay of the neighborhood for years. The small building, a one-story stone house, dates from 1949. Schooner's interior, though, has a more 1990's look, its cream walls covered with pictures of ships and its ceiling decorated with oars and sculls.
1990-10-26	4th-Largest Credit-Card Unit on Sale	The fourth-largest credit-card business in the country was put up for sale yesterday. Its owner, the largest banking company in Maryland, is raising cash to compensate for heavy losses on commercial real estate loans. The sale by the MNC Financial Corporation of Baltimore will be an opportunity, analysts predicted, for large industrial companies like the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the General Electric Company to dramatically increase their activity in a business dominated by banks.
1990-10-21	"DINING OUT;

Seasonal Ingredients Star in Eastchester"	LEAD: PINOCCHIO has long been one of our favorite restaurants and, the plainness of the dining rooms notwithstanding, misses having a higher rating for only a very few flaws. Diners avoiding them can have an ''excellent'' if not memorable meal here. The high cost of fresh, seasonal ingredients, in particular the frequent and generous use of wild mushrooms, is reflected in the prices.
1990-10-14	"DINING OUT;

New Owner for a Stylish Bistro in Nyack"	LEAD: THIS Hudson House should not be mistaken for another restaurant in the area bearing that name. Any confusion comes from Matthew Hudson's determination to use his family name for the stylish bistro (last occupied by Raoul's) that he and his wife, Amy, own in the heart of downtown Nyack.
1990-10-14	A Fresh Look Graces Larger Quarters	LEAD: AT a time when restaurant closings seem to be a fact of business life, it is refreshing to see a new restaurant succeed. Nantucket Cafe opened its doors more than three years ago in a minuscule spot in New Canaan and evidently filled such a need for an informal place serving pleasant, reasonably priced food that it burst its seams and sought larger quarters.
1990-09-30	The Inn Is Old, but the Menu Is Not	LEAD: LIKE the buggy whip, the village of Ivoryton's raison d'etre disappeared long ago. Once the center of a thriving industry in piano keyboards, in an era when the keys were made of elephant tusks, Ivoryton derived its name from its major industry, and some of the imposing houses along the main street belonged to merchants in the ivory trade.
1990-09-23	"DINING OUT;

An Unlikely Place to Find Eclectic Food"	LEAD: SOMETIMES one gets tips on restaurants that are to be found in the most unlikely places. Take Paparazzi, for example. Unless you got lost looking for the locker room after a game of tennis at the Tiger Racquet and Health Club, you would never stumble across this agreeable little spot by chance.
1990-09-14	Signet Prices $500 Million in Certificates	LEAD: A total of $500 million in senior and subordinated asset-backed certificates were priced yesterday through Signet Credit Card Trust 1990-1, with Goldman, Sachs & Company as underwriter.
1990-09-09	"DINING OUT;

Tuscan Food, Casually Stylish Setting"	LEAD: FOR all its gentrifying in the last few years, Jersey City has been disappointingly slow to come up with some first-rate restaurants, and so word of a casually stylish new eating place specializing in Tuscan cuisine was welcome.
1990-09-09	"DINING OUT;

Taking a Step Off the Beaten Path"	LEAD: ONLY a few miles from both Connecticut and Massachusetts borders and a minute or two east of Route 22 in Dutchess County, the New Yorker offers vacationers, concertgoers, autumn-foliage seekers or antiques-hounds an opportunity to swing off the main road for what can be a considerably better than average meal in certainly serene, attractive surroundings.
1990-09-09	Technology;   The Internationalization of the Cash Machine	LEAD: American Express traveler's checks? Just leave home without them. In a development that could render traveler's checks obsolete and spell doom for street-corner money changers, automated teller machines are rapidly going global. Already, for example, a tourist from Buffalo can walk up to at least a few automated tellers in Tokyo and withdraw cash, in yen, from his or her bank back home.
1990-09-07	Finance/New Issues;   Credit Card Issue To Yield 8.97%	LEAD: Valley National Credit Card Trust 1990-A is offering through J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. a $300 million issue of asset-backed securities that are supported by Mastercard and Visa credit card receivables from the Valley National Bank of Arizona.

1990-08-26	"DINING OUT;

An Appealing Mediterranean Menu"	LEAD: ES-TA-TI, a hyphenated version of the word that means ''summer'' in northern Italian dialect, is the curious name of a year-old offspring of the restaurant Maureen in Cape May. Stephen and Maureen Horn, who have offered contemporary French and American fare at her namesake dining room upstairs for several years, now provide a satisfying melange of Mediterranean dishes, mostly northern Italian, on the ground floor.
1990-08-23	Credit Cards Back $215 Million Issue	LEAD: Colonial National Bank USA yesterday priced $215 million in floating-rate asset-backed certificates with a maturity date of Oct. 15, 1996, through a specially formed trust, Colonial Credit Card Trust 1990-A The certificates, which are backed by Mastercard and Visa credit card receivables, have an estimated average life of 4.3 years and are priced at par for an initial yield of 42 basis points more than the one-month London interbank offered rate - the basic short-term rate of interest in the Eurodollar market and the rate to which many Eurodollar loans and deposits are tied.
1990-08-21	Interest Rates Set at Citicorp On a $1.4 Billion Offering	LEAD: In the largest corporate deal in the global arena since the outbreak of hostilities in the Persian Gulf more than two weeks ago, Citicorp announced interest rates yesterday on a two-part, $1.4 billion issue of asset-backed securities.
1990-08-19	"DINING OUT;

French and Italian Fare by the Delaware"	LEAD: THERE are few restaurants where one can eat out of doors during the summer. So the Black Tulip in Washington Crossing, with its outdoor terrace abutting the road that runs alongside the Delaware River, is a welcome addition to the dining-out scene.
1990-08-19	"DINING OUT;

A Chinese Newcomer Serving Ossining"	LEAD: THE most recent in the string of Chinese restaurants occupying this storefront spot in the Arcadian Shopping Center, Panda Garden 1 continues in their tradition. This neighborhood newcomer offers moderately priced dishes (lunch is a particular bargain) that for the most part show care and thought.
1990-08-19	Unions Are Expanding Their Role to Survive in the 90's	LEAD: Organized labor, battered by union-busting, concessions contracts and shrinking membership during the 1980's has begun to expand its services to attract new members and remain relevant for the ones they already have.
1990-08-14	A.T.&T.'s New Card Stirs Strong Response	LEAD: The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that the pace at which it distributed its new A.T.&T. Universal card, a combination calling card and general purpose credit card, had accelerated sharply this summer.
1990-08-12	"CONNECTICUT OPINION;

Young Americans Are Getting Burned by Easy Credit"	LEAD: MY grandfather used to say, ''If you can't afford it, save your money until you can.'' But it took a real lesson in the malice of credit-card spending to show me the wisdom of his words.
1990-08-12	Livelier Cuisine for a Cafe in Westport	LEAD: FEW Fairfield County restaurants have the longevity of Cafe de la Plage in Westport. The cozy little place in a sandy cove facing Long Island Sound has survived changes in ownership and chefs, has persevered.Its delightful view almost insures survival. (Our memory of the place dates to 1956, when it featured ''San Francisco cuisine.
1990-08-10	The Editorial Notebook;   Vietnam Again, for the First Time	LEAD: Fifteen years after North Vietnamese tanks smashed into Saigon's Presidential Palace, there are still two Vietnams. The Republic of (South) Vietnam, that artificial creation of French colonialism and cold war politics, is no more. But commercial capitalism, the American presence and the Viet Cong-led insurrection pressed a distinctive subculture onto the South.
1990-08-05	All About/Phone Cards;   The Latest Front In a Long-Distance Telephone War	LEAD: TELEPHONE calling cards were long the industry's doormats - useful, but taken for granted. Now the largest long-distance companies are giving them mantelpiece display. These thin plastic rectangles for charging calls, with 10-digit numbers and magnetic strips, have become favored weapons in the battle for the nation's $52 billion long-distance market.
1990-07-29	"DINING OUT;

2d Look at a Japanese Spot in Thornwood"	LEAD: DINERS who might have tried Cho Cho San several years ago and were disappointed in reluctant dining room service and mediocre food should take another look. The restaurant has come a long way. Snappy, attentive service, an active sushi counter and decent kitchen techniques have taken this eating spot out of the doldrums.
1990-07-22	"DINING OUT;

American Cuisine and a Lakeside View"	LEAD: THE name of a restaurant is often more enticing than the restaurant itself. For instance, diners drawn to the Sophisticated Otter on Seneca Lake in Sussex County will be disappointed on entering the restaurant because, despite the name, it is casual in the extreme.
1990-07-22	Awash With Seafood in Waterbury	LEAD: ANY preconceptions one might have about the fare to be found at a cafe calling itself No Fish Today can be tossed out the window when the huge chalkboard menu is hauled to the table. The long list is awash with fish and seafood dishes, plus a handful of other choices.
1990-07-17	Mastercard Plans to Offer Discounts	LEAD: IN an extension of its new pitch to Middle America, Mastercard International Inc. said yesterday that it was joining six national retailers to offer discounts of 10 percent to 50 percent on items like compact disks and furniture when consumers charge them on Mastercard.
1990-07-15	"DINING OUT;

A Nice Mix of Bistro Chic and Casual"	LEAD: OFF and on, Madison has been a hot restaurant town for the last few years, and 1990 is looking up with some recent changes in the local dining scene. The Cook Plaza Cafe, for example, tucked down an alley, has moved around the corner into the former Meeting Place, and Cook Plaza is now called Richard's Cafe
1990-07-08	Where Seafood Gets a Proper Reception	LEAD: WHEN Cafe du Bec Fin opened more than 10 years ago, it merited an Excellent rating for its exquisite nouvelle-cuisine cooking and presentation. Later, a change of ownership, from the original chef to his sous-chef, and a coarsening of the fare brought a revised appraisal in this column to Good.
1990-07-06	Credit Card Fraud Charged	LEAD: Visa International and Mastercard International filed a multimillion-dollar fraud lawsuit today contending that a vast telemarketing scheme with nationwide tentacles recruited small companies to launder credit card charges.
1990-07-01	"DINING OUT;

A Good Place to Sample Thai Cuisine"	LEAD: VIBRANT Thai cooking, with its contrasts of spicy and cool, sweet and acidic, seems custom-made for perking up languid summer palates. A few years ago, gastronomic gurus were predicting that the cuisine of Thailand would be the next hot - in both senses of the word - food trend to sweep the country.
1990-07-01	"DINING OUT;

A Traditional Steakhouse in Port Chester"	LEAD: THE Willett House is certainly worth knowing about, even now in only its third month of operation. To our knowledge it is the county's first steakhouse that brings with it the tradition of the acclaimed greats: the Peter Luger Steakhouse in Brooklyn, an establishment famous for its porterhouse steaks, and Manhattan's Palm, where, besides beef, lobsters come in sizes big, bigger and biggest.
1990-06-27	Citibank Visa Offers Long-Distance Calls	LEAD: A bitter struggle for credit card customers between the nation's largest telephone company and the nation's biggest bank took a new turn yesterday, when Citibank announced that it would offer long-distance telephone service to its 14.5 million Visa cardholders.
1990-06-22	Restaurants	LEAD: Chez Josephine
1990-06-17	"WESTCHESTER OPINION;

Checking Out the Most Democratic Credit Card"	LEAD: THE most important of my credit cards is not Visa or Mastercard or American Express or Carte Blanche. It does not provide accidental death insurance when I charge my airline or train tickets. It does not provide traveler's checks without fee. It does not charge me an annual fee, or extravagant interest if I fail to return the loan within a specified period.
1990-06-17	Portuguese Fare and Value in Waterbury	LEAD: FOR people who like to dine out but lament the rapid escalation of restaurant prices, there is still some basis for hope: think ethnic. Many ethnic restaurants are less expensive than other types. And among these establishments, none offer more reasonable prices or greater value than the Portuguese.
1990-06-10	An Updated Menu in a Venerable Setting	LEAD: IN an industry of ebb and flow, Scribner's is a tribute to the staying power of owner managership. The chef-owner, Scribner Bliss, and his wife, Beth, have kept the 16-year-old seafood restaurant on course with the consistent high performance that made it notable in the first place.
1990-06-08	Filling the Body After Nourishing the Soul	LEAD: The East Village, for all its renown as an incubator for new ideas in music, art, film and theater, does not have a reputation as a hotbed of gastronomy.
1990-06-03	"DINING OUT;

Traditional and Updated French Dishes"	LEAD: LA PETITE BRASSERIE offers a handful of appealing French provincial dishes in an intimate setting - but first you have to find it. Up a hill in a semiresidential section of Hawthorne, south of Ridgewood, this Passaic County restaurant has as its only clue a small pink neon sign at the foot of a driveway.
1990-06-03	"DINING OUT;

American Fare in Casual Fishkill Setting"	LEAD: NOW that the weather has decidedly swung into its summer phase, roads will be full of vacationers driving to and from the ''country,'' looking, perhaps, to have a bite to eat along the way. In Dutchess County, the Fishkill area has a number of restaurants that will fill the bills of those seeking anything from Mexican to the hautest of cuisines.
1990-06-03	Japanese Fare With Views of the Sound	LEAD: WATERFRONT dining is at a premium in Connecticut, reason enough to savor the experience of Sapporo in Stratford. The Japanese restaurant, which faces Long Island Sound at the mouth of the Housatonic River, is at the very end of Sniffen Lane; Milford Point is directly across the water.
1990-05-26	MERCHANTS' REQUESTS MAKE SHOPPERS BALK	LEAD: More and more customer are rebelling when they make a purchase with a check or credit card and the merchant asks for certain types of personal identification.
1990-05-25	Air Fares Are Cut, but Restrictions Apply	LEAD: Continental Airlines yesterday matched fare cuts made by other carriers and said it would honor United Airlines coupons that take an additional $35 off round-trip prices.
1990-05-25	Restaurants	LEAD: If you have any doubts that New Yorkers are in a thrifty mood these days, just drop into the teeming dining room of Rose Cafe, an upbeat American restaurant on lower Fifth Avenue that serves single-digit appetizers and main courses that peak at $19. The success of this six-month-old effort is even more impressive considering it occupies a space that has seen two higher-priced flops in the past three years, Mosaico and 24 Fifth Avenue.
1990-05-20	A Popular Newcomer on the East End	LEAD: SUMMER is still a month away, but Hampton trendsetters are making a beeline to Basilico Restaurant. Everyone who is anyone has already made the trek. Old Southamptonites, looking like they just stepped out of a Ralph Lauren advertisement, rub shoulders with the straight-from-SoHo set decked out in the latest gear.
1990-05-20	Korean Flavors Arrive in New Haven	LEAD: THE latest Asian cuisine to find a welcome in downtown New Haven is Korean, and judging by the crowds flowing in and out of the large dining room of Seoul, this was overdue.
1990-05-19	D'Agostino To Accept Debit Cards	LEAD: New York City banks tout 15-minute mortgage approvals, 24-hour service for credit card customers, and some of the world's most imaginative business financing. But they have been laggards when it comes to helping customers with more ordinary tasks, like buying groceries.
1990-05-18	A.T.&T. Credit Card Is Attacked	LEAD: The American Telephone and Telegraph Company's complex arrangements to sponsor a bank credit card are drawing criticism from rivals in the business.
1990-05-17	A Prize in a Literary Garden	LEAD: IN the rosy light of a spring morning, sheep graze in the new fallen snow in a deserted mountainous region of old mines. Below in the Elan Valley along the banks of a river, one garden is covered with drifts of daffodils, and the yew topiary is beginning to sprout new shoots of pale green.
1990-05-13	"DINING OUT;

A Place to Try Unusual Chinese Dishes"	LEAD: CHINESE restaurants that have opened in the last few years are frequently elegant and modern, a far cry from the plain shopping center type or the fancier but sometimes garish establishments with Chinese artifacts.
1990-05-13	"DINING OUT;

Freshness Heads the Menu in Tuckahoe"	LEAD: Diners frequent restaurants for a number of reasons and skillfully prepared fresh ingredients are not always the reason for customer loyalty. Service or atmosphere or price often dictate which restaurants become favorites. All this is by way of saying that although dining at Salerno's can still be a treat, our recent visits have been somewhat disappointing, perhaps because we have difficulty reconciling the pricey dishes with the informality of the place.
1990-05-09	Visa and Mastercard Cancel Card Venture	LEAD: The two largest credit card companies, Visa and Mastercard, agreed yesterday to stop joint development of a nationwide debit card. The agreement was part of the settlement of a lawsuit filed last year by law enforcement officials in 14 states.
1990-05-06	"DINING OUT;

An International Menu in Scarsdale"	LEAD: In the two short years since its opening, Cafe L. A. has managed both to elude the blahs that often set in after initial accolades and to maintain high quality in both ingredients and performance. David Shakin, Cafe L. A.'s creative chef, has designed a distinctive menu for this restaurant, an appealing international mix that he calls contemporary Italian-American (erstwhile California).
1990-05-06	Stylish Spot for French and Italian Fare	LEAD: THE setting at Bellini is elegant, and the restaurant's management has seemingly worked a miracle, turning the long, narrow first floor of a modest three-story house in a disheveled neighborhood into an intimate dining room. It is a study in gray silk moire, with a beveled mirror centerpiece wall, Art
1990-05-03	BRIEFS	LEAD: Debt
1990-04-29	Modern Flavors in a Historic Setting	LEAD: NEW ENGLAND inns aren't what they used to be, and traveling epicures should be thankful for that. The era of sticky buns, cottage cheese relish dishes and Indian pudding has given way to New American cooking and the use of familiar fresh ingredients in unexpected ways. An example of an old inn with new ways is the Simsbury 1820 House.
1990-04-27	Citicorp Offering Totals $250 Million	LEAD: Citicorp is offering $250 million in certificates backed by Mastercard and Visa loan receivables through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
1990-04-22	"DINING OUT;

A Reopened Landmark in South Salem"	LEAD: WE had mixed feelings when, after 19 years, the old Horse and Hound Inn closed. The place was unique for serving a feudal feast of exotic meats in heavy sauces, for having spare but authentic early-American charm and for keeping one of the best wine cellars in the area. But its closing may have been fortuitous, occurring as it did a little more than a year ago, just as raised consciousness and dietary trends deemed unfashionable and unhealthy the consumption of large quantities of bear, reindeer, alligator and buffalo.
1990-04-20	American Express Has Worst Loss	LEAD: The American Express Company, reflecting record losses at its Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. subsidiary, reported the worst quarterly results in its history yesterday - a loss of $619.8 million in the first quarter, compared with a gain a year earlier of $251.9 million, or 59 cents a share.
1990-04-19	A.T.&T. Net Up 12.5%; MCI Gains	LEAD: The American Telephone and Telegraph Company reported a 12.5 percent first-quarter earnings gain yesterday, and the MCI Communications Corporation, the second-largest long-distance telephone company after A.T.&T., reported a 22 percent increase.
1990-04-15	A Tiny but Fashionable Spot for Dinner	LEAD: PRACTICALLY before Paul L'Abbee could say the word restaurant, he had one. What opened in New Canaan early last year as a deli-pastry shop and showcase for a Pound Ridge, N.Y., catering business, quickly accelerated into a modest dining spot, with a few tables for lunch, tea and sampling.

1990-04-09	Mastercard's Shift From Glamour	LEAD: Something risky is happening at Mastercard.

1990-04-08	"CONNECTICUT OPINION;

Far-Off Banks Offer Credit Where It's Due"	LEAD: MY story is not novel, but that does not make it any less troubling. I recently applied over the telephone for an increase in the credit limit of my Mastercard. My balance was already at the limit, and although I had no specific plans to charge anything else, I wanted at least to have the option of using the card in an emergency.
1990-04-01	BUSINESS DIARY	LEAD: COMPANIES Round and Round, and Yet Another Round, at Lockheed First, Harold C. Simmons bought nearly 19 percent of the Lockheed Corporation's shares. Then he called in the image doctors. Out came a videotape portraying him as a steady, hard-working industrialist. And on Thursday, Lockheed executives who had denounced him as a hungry corporate raider went through their own transformation, emerging as advocates of shareholder rights.
1990-04-01	A New Attraction in South Norwalk	LEAD: SOUTH NORWALK'S restaurant row, in the area known as SoNo - Washington Street between Main and Water Streets - has gained a new attraction. It is the Old Rialto, formerly the Atlantic Club, which changed its chef and menu as well as its name. The fin de siecle building was once a theater, but the Old Rialto decor is more high seas than high C's.
1990-03-31	A.T.&T. Card Offers New Connection	LEAD: Millions of Americans are being asked to try yet another credit card, this time the American Telephone & Telegraph Company's new calling and general-purpose card. The first word is that it seems to be a good deal for many consumers.

1990-03-27	BUSINESS DIGEST	LEAD: THE ECONOMY The savings industry had its worst year ever in 1989, with losses soaring to $19.2 billion, regulators said. Although a record loss had been expected, the amount surprised experts. Indeed, losses from operations for 485 troubled institutions amounted to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, equivalent to a taxpayer loss of $29 million a day as long as the institutions stayed open in that period.
1990-03-25	"DINING OUT;

Taste and Mood of Spain in White Plains"	LEAD: FOR 15 years, the white-plastered Moorish facade of Meson Castellano has welcomed diners to the some of the pleasures of Spanish-Continental dining. Inside, a dark wooden partition partly screens the cozy bar from the dining area and lends an exotic Spanish moodiness, borne out further in the many folksy and charming pitchers, plates and tiles that decorate the room.
1990-03-24	Doubling the Guarantee on a Computer	LEAD: Here is a tip for people buying a home computer: Charge it on either a gold Visa or a gold Mastercard.

1990-03-21	Banks Balk at Costs of Japan	LEAD: United States trade negotiators have been hammering away for years to open Japanese markets, yet many American companies, even giants like Citibank, the nation's largest bank, find Japan a daunting challenge.

The modest storefront facade sends few signals of the delicious food that awaits within.
1990-03-10	CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost;   Credit Card Trade-Ups	LEAD: With the credit card market saturated, issuers of gold cards are pressing more affluent consumers to ''trade up'' because gold cards offer higher profits and lower risks. It makes sense for holders of standard Visa cards or Mastercards to consider switching to gold because the rates and annual fees for these cards are on their way down and are either lower than or competitive with the lowest charges for standard cards.
1990-03-04	Congenial Setting for Italian Fare	LEAD: CINZANO'S in Fairfield is a year-old restaurant that sends mixed signals to first-time visitors. Outside the entrance are handsome, terra cotta pots, but to enter the restaurant, you have to pass through a mundane bar. Once inside the restaurant proper, you are greeted by a stylish, semiformal decor of tapestry-backed banquettes and chairs, rose-colored carpeting, wood paneling and a back wall covered with an oil painting of a pastoral Italian scene, the front a wall of greenhouse-style glass windows.

1990-02-15	Market Place;   Drexel's Strength: A Numbers Game	LEAD: AS Drexel Burnham Lambert tumbled, it was able to assert that it was a financially strong firm. To back up that claim, it could even point to Federal standards it was more than complying with. Now, Drexel's ability to conform to regulatory standards is raising questions about whether those safeguards are so full of holes that investors can easily be misled.
1990-02-15	Treasuries Drop in Light Trading	LEAD: Prices of Treasury securities dipped in light trading yesterday, as investor concerns eased about further financial fallout from the demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
1990-02-12	Checking Accounts Offer Buyer-Protection Insurance	LEAD: Some might call it a sales gimmick, but others see it as a valuable consumer service: The old-fashioned checking account is being adorned with new insurance that automatically protects goods bought by check against damage or loss and extends manufacturers' warranties.
1990-02-11	"DINING OUT;

Light and Healthful Fare in Hastings"	LEAD: DEVIN ANTHONYS is one of an increasing number of neighborhood restaurants looking hard at what today's diner wants and making an effort to deliver it. To judge from the crowds that line up not only on weekends but also on weeknights, Devin Anthonys has discovered a winning formula: feature pasta and seafood, lighten sauces and be ready to accommodate diners who want none at all, add a fresh salad and a generous variety of carefully cooked vegetables and deliver the tasty goods in unstinting portions and at a moderate if not a bargain price.
1990-02-11	Lifestyle: Sunday Outing;   Rambling in Westchester County: Antiques, Repasts and Greenery	LEAD: Sometimes Sunday outings need not have a destination, but rather a direction - and let chance be your tour guide. A leisurely drive through parts of Westchester County offers a little of everything to the weekend rambler: history, antiques, scenery, shopping, and even some exceptionally fine dining.
1990-02-11	Where Sushi Is the Strong Suit	LEAD: ONE of New Haven's many attractions is the ethnic diversity of its restaurant scene.

1990-01-21	DINING OUT South, West and Southwest in Port Chester	LEAD: >HE Black Sheep certainly has a lot going for it: both upstairs and downstairs dining rooms have an airy, tropical feel suggested by towering, well-tended plants, a soft sculpture of a palm tree and faux Gauguins - open-faced, trusting islanders who smile down their benedictions over the repast. A good sound system belts out easy-to-take popular tapes, candlelight flickers, service is personal.

1989-12-17	In Pizza, Something for Everyone	LEAD: SINCE the late 40's, the popularity of pizza has spread so far that for some families it is now as American as apple pie. And just about everyone has a preference in pizza: Neapolitan. Sicilian. Chicago. Thick crust or thin. Recent years added a new dimension, the California-style pizza with toppings that can include anything from artichokes to zucchini.
1989-12-17	Persuading Americans To Save	LEAD: POLITICIANS here finally appear to be waking up to what economists have been telling them: The long binge of overspending and undersaving by government, business and consumers threatens to depress living standards and reduce the nation to a second-rate economic force during the next decade. Already, there are symptoms, among them lagging productivity, slow wage growth, the sale of major assets to foreign investors, stubbornly high interest rates and the huge trade and budget deficits.
1989-12-10	A Rebirth in Country French in Norwalk	LEAD: TALENT and perseverance will out, as the chef Patrick Benrezkellan and the co-owner and maitre d'hotel Patrick Ravanello, both formerly with Guy Savoy in Greenwich, have demonstrated so ably in transforming a good South Norwalk storefront delicatessen and bistro called Cafe Parfait into La Provence, an excellent

1989-11-03	Strategies for Dining Cheaply and Well	LEAD: NEW YORK is one of the most expensive dining cities in the world; it is also one of the cheapest. You can have a transcendent feast for $100 at the Quilted Giraffe, or a platter of lemon-grass chicken at Saigon in Chinatown for $5.95. Finding the best dining bargains in town requires persistence and a resilient stomach, as I learned on a recent tour of about three dozen inexpensive restaurants in Manhattan.
1989-10-29	The New Business Lunch: Offbeat Restaurants	LEAD: DICK BYRNE, AN EXECUTIVE vice president of a New York advertising agency, is a veteran of more long, bibulous business lunches than he cares to recall.

1989-09-17	DINING OUT Song and Southwest Flavor in Pawlin	LEAD: IN its move from a 200-year-old building in Beekmanville last year, the Towne Crier Cafe lost some of the funky charm that we do not lament. While it may lack the dusty ghosts of the former quarters, the new site in Pawling has the capacity and the means to satisfy discriminating diners as well as fans of entertainers such as Janis Ian, Queen Ida, Herbie Mann, Maria Muldaur, the Rude Girls, Leon Redbone, Oscar Brand and the Persuasions.

1989-09-03	Chinese With an Indonesian Accent	LEAD: THE name of one of New Canaan's newest restaurants, the Little Kitchen of New Canaan, could be a little misleading. Instead of the homey image of pot roast and Mom's apple pie that such a name might evoke, this small restaurant is a study in the sophisticated use of minimum space and intelligent decorating.

Mike Keaveney stood at the window of reflective glass, a pair of binoculars trained across Broadway. No one could see in, he knew that.

A roomier garden entrance with etched-glass doors, wall sconces muted with pleated red shades, green carpeting, pink and white linen, brass candle lamps on every table and fresh paint have greatly enhanced the cozy, pine-paneled dining room.
1989-06-25	Seafood, With Views of the Sound	LEAD: A SUMMER-LONG question in Connecticut is not just where one can find good seafood, but where can one find it along the shore. The short answer to both questions is the Wharf. This simple, but attractive shore-side restuarant, ensconced in the Madison Beach Hotel in Madison, is as close to the shoreline as a building can be without being swept away.
1989-06-18	"DINING OUT;
Indoors or Outdoors in Roadside Yonkers"	LEAD: AT best, the cooking at Peppercorns is amateurish, but many of the dishes are priced accordingly - particularly on the ''light'' or ''patio'' menu and on the daily specials. For example, a thick boneless slab of prime-rib special, poorly trimmed, overcooked but tender and low on meaty flavor, goes for $9, dryish salad and tough french fries included.
1989-06-18	"DINING OUT;
Eclectic Fare in a Former Firehouse"	LEAD: THE engaging little Park Avenue Cafe in Rutherford came under new ownership last August, but the casual diner might not even have noticed much of a change. Imaginative, eclectic fare still issues from the kitchen, and a neighborhoody atmosphere is still the order at the restaurant, which is a few blocks off Route 3 just west of the
1989-06-18	Lunch on the Connecticut River	LEAD: THERE is so much wringing of hands each summer over where to eat at the water's edge that perhaps a new solution is called for: eat on the water instead, on a cruise boat that serves lunch and dinner.
1989-06-11	Taste of the Cuisine of Northern India	LEAD: EACH year brings new restaurants purveying the fiery creations of ethnic areas - the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Hunan; Mexico; Vietnam, and, most recently, Thailand. Yet, the number of Indian restaurants in the state remains small. Now, aficionados of Indian cuisines have Kismet, a new restaurant that calls its extensive repertory ''frontier cuisine.
1989-06-09	Lomas to Sell Credit Card Bank Operation	LEAD: The Lomas Financial Corporation said today that it had agreed to sell its credit card bank subsidiary for $500 million in cash and preferred stock to an investor group led by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. The price is the highest ever paid for a credit card business.
1989-06-04	"DINING OUT;
Traditional American Fare at an Old Inn"	LEAD: ALTHOUGH Atlantic City is only about 20 miles down the road, the Inn at Sugar Hill in Mays Landing is light-years away from the glitzy casino scene. The quaint restaurant and inn perched on the bank of Great Egg Harbor River is long on charm, if not quite on gastronomic polish.
1989-06-02	Credit Cards Back Citibank Security	LEAD: Citibank is selling $845 million of credit card participation certificates through National Credit Card Trust, with the First Boston Corporation as lead underwriter for the financing.
1989-05-28	For Central Asset Accounts, New Allure	LEAD: With the stock market hitting post-crash highs and the bulls once again in ascendance, so-called central asset accounts have a fresh allure.
1989-05-27	Chase in Biggest Purchase Of a Credit Card Business	LEAD: In the largest purchase ever of a credit card business, the Chase Manhattan Corporation is buying about 1.2 million Visa and Mastercard accounts with more than $1.1 billion of outstanding debts from the Michigan National Corporation.
1989-05-27	BUSINESS DIGEST, SATURDAY, MAY 27, 1989	LEAD: Markets
1989-05-21	"DINING OUT;
A Blend of Sophistication and Simplicity"	LEAD: IT has been about a year since hands changed at Toto. That's when Dennis Foy left to open Mondrian in Manhattan and Edward Lloyd took over the reins of the attractive restaurant, just off Summit's main shopping street. After a subsequent turnover of chefs, Toto appears to be on a fairly even keel, and the time seemed right for a return visit.
1989-05-21	A New Place for Meat Binges	LEAD: BEEF and pork sales may be down, but many people still have the occasional urge for a meat binge, often especially for an old-fashioned, Southern-style barbecue spree.
1989-05-21	TRAVEL ADVISORY	LEAD: Airlines Mark Routes With Special Fares
1989-05-17	Lomas Examining Deals to Cut Debt	LEAD: The Lomas Financial Corporation said it was analyzing four transactions, including the sale of its profitable credit-card banking subsidiary, as part of a plan to cut its long-term debt to $4 billion, from $5.5 billion. In an interview, Jess Hay, chairman and chief executive, described the Lomas Bank U.S.A., which is based in Wilmington, Del., as an attractive property.
1989-05-14	Fare for the Family, Tex-Mex Style	LEAD: LOBOS BAR AND GRILL occupies the basement of the old Veterans Hall, a landmark in New Canaan that faces the Town Hall on Main Street. Viewed from the street, there is merely an inconspicuous awning extending from what looks like an empty building. Yet the moment one opens the door, the scene changes radically.
1989-05-12	Restaurants	LEAD: In three and a half years, Union Square Cafe has garnered a well-deserved national reputation as a paragon among a new breed of restaurants that might be called international bistros. Danny Meyer, the engaging young American owner, studied in Italy and France, but clearly his soul resides in Tuscany.
1989-05-07	Shopping Around for a Credit Card Deal	LEAD: Holders of credit cards, take note: Now just may be the time to shop around to see if you are getting the best possible deal.
1989-05-01	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Credit Card Shift to Chiat	LEAD: Facing intense competition from Visa and Mastercard, as well as from its own products, American Express switched its $25 million gold card account on Friday from McCann-Erickson to Chiat/Day, New York, and its unit, Perkins/Butler Direct Marketing.
1989-05-01	Top Credit Card Companies Explore Fast-Food Tie-Ins	LEAD: Like titans curious but still wary of each other, the credit card and fast-food industries are exploring an alliance.
1989-05-01	Rate Outlook Appears Uncertain	LEAD: Economic data to be released in the next few weeks will be critical in determining the course of interest rates, credit market participants and analysts say.
1989-04-30	Back to Basics, With Meat and Potatoes	LEAD: IT is beginning to look as though a single organization, Entertaining Moments Inc., has revitalized the downtown dining scene of New Haven. Entertaining Moments is the company that brought the trendy and delightful Bruxelles Brasserie, Scoozzi Trattoria and Wine Bar, and Gentree Ltd. to the city. Its latest restaurant is called Three Sixty Eight, on the corner of Orange and Audubon
1989-04-28	Diner's Journal	LEAD: Wet Paint
1989-04-23	"DINING OUT;
Unpretentious Eclectic Fare in Chatham"	LEAD: WHEN Chatham's venerable William Pitt Restaurant burned down a couple of years ago, the Morris County town lost an architectural, if not a gastronomic, landmark. Then, starting last fall, a cluster of new buildings in an updated Colonial style sprang up to contain shops and condominiums on the old site.
1989-04-23	Night Shift	LEAD: THE SECOND VERSE OF GENESIS informs us that before there was anything else, ''darkness was upon the face of the deep.'' Then God decreed light. By 7,000 B.C., our ancestors had become handy with fire, and night was more than just something to sleep through. By the 17th century, John Milton could ask, ''What hath night to do with sleep?
1989-04-23	Casual Choices in Bustling SoNo	LEAD: OPERATING on the ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it'' principle, the owners of the small, successful Breakaway in Fairfield have opened Sweptaway, another restaurant with the same breezy spirit, in the revitalized SoNo neighborhood of South Norwalk.
1989-04-22	The Credit Card That Would Do It All	LEAD: The nation's first all-in-one banking, telephone and credit card is being offered in Connencticut by a bank and a telephone company.

1989-04-13	BRIEFS	LEAD: * Alberta Energy Co., Calgary, Alberta, said it would sell its non-Canadian oil and gas assets to its Chieftain Development Co. unit for $96.1 million (Canadian).
1989-04-09	"DINING OUT;
Imaginative Presentation in Harrison"	LEAD: SINCE its inception eight years ago, Jillyflower's has become something of a landmark for diners seeking fresh ingredients prepared with consistent care and imagination. The chef currently in residence is Tony Lopa, who two years ago took the wooden spoon from Mark Filippo without missing a beat, it seems.
1989-04-09	Traditional Thai and Warm Hospitality	LEAD: IT is not a quantum leap from Hunan and Sichuan Chinese regional cooking, a recent rage in Connecticut, to the even more incendiary cuisine of Thailand. A new Thai arrival is King & I in Bridgeport, across from Treeland off the Huntington Turnpike. (Take exit 8 on Route 8.) As new and small as it is - just a narrow storefront with a tiny upper level - King & I was packed with diners on what are normally slow weeknights, and many of the patrons at the close-together tables seemed to be regulars.
1989-04-01	Some Pay Phones Are Booby-Trapped With High Rates	LEAD: Starting today, callers across the nation who use a pay telephone for a long-distance call that requires the help of an operator could end up paying a high rate for the call if they do not check the new dialing instructions posted on the phone.
1989-03-28	Credit Card Accord Due	LEAD: JCB International, the largest provider of bank-related credit cards in Japan, is about to take a major step toward allowing its cards to be accepted by American merchants.
1989-03-26	A Cozy Oasis in Busy New Haven	LEAD: NEW HAVEN'S restaurant choices, as befits a university town, are becoming increasingly international. The latest to appear on the scene is a Vietnamese restaurant, Saigon City, on Chapel Street at the corner of Park Street.
1989-03-24	Where Value Is a Specialty of the House	LEAD: OF all the questions posed to a restaurant critic, the most typical is: ''Can you suggest a really nice place for dinner: good food, a lively ambiance, efficient service, and it shouldn't be too far off in the boondocks? Oh yes, it has to be inexpensive.''
1989-03-19	Italian With Imaginative Informality	LEAD: WHAT are the ingredients that assure a restaurant's success? If there were a textbook answer to that question, every entrepreneur opening an eating establishment would be guaranteed a quick return on the investment.
1989-03-12	"DINING OUT;
A Rebirth With Elegance in Hoboken"	LEAD: FOR several years the lace-curtain bistro above a saloon called the Brass Rail, on Hoboken's main street, was a regular stop for fans of the uncomplicated, undated French fare offered there at uninflated prices. After a fire about a year ago, however, the restaurant was closed, and it seemed that the Brass Rail was to be yet another gastronomic memory.
1989-03-11	Stuck With Tickets? Some of the Options	LEAD: Eastern Airlines spokesmen, travel industry officials and consumer experts yesterday began to provide some answers to the questions asked by the thousands of worried Eastern ticket-holders who have been swamping the offices and telephone lines of their travel agents, hoping for a refund or a flight on another airline.
1989-03-10	Restaurants	LEAD: Brive Robert Pritsker, the chef and proprietor of Brive on East 58th Street, is like a brilliant yet puckish schoolboy, capable of dazzling the class with his lightning intellect, yet at the same time prone to scattering tacks on your seat when you go to the water fountain. His genteel town-house restaurant, with its pale yellow walls, Oriental rugs and antique furnishings, suggests tradition and consistency.
1989-03-05	"DINING OUT;
Italian Cuisine and a Cozy Atmosphere"	LEAD: TRANSPLANTED New Yorkers who miss the casual coziness of the Italian restaurants in Little Italy may wish to check out Rispoli's, a year-old restaurant tucked away off the main street in Montclair. However, to find Rispoli's by car is sometimes an art in itself. If you are going east on Bloomfield Avenue, you actually have to drive through a parking garage in Park Street until you reach the other side, which is North Fullerton Street.
1989-03-03	Discover Card In Visa Link	LEAD: The credit card processor Visa U.S.A. has agreed to an electronic link with Sears, Roebuck & Company's Discover card that could lead to greater acceptance of Discover by merchants, a Sears spokesman said today.
1989-03-02	"BUSINESS PEOPLE;

1989-03-02	Big Crowds Greet the New Sears	LEAD: In scenes reminiscent of the busiest days of Christmas, huge crowds poured into Sears, Roebuck stores around the country yesterday as the company introduced its new low-price policy.
1989-02-24	Restaurants	LEAD: La Metairie
1989-02-19	Friendly Hunan in West Haven	LEAD: A RESTAURANT writer could keep busy reviewing Connecticut's Chinese restaurants alone. It is not just the reviewing, but the need for re-reviewing, as nothing in the food service industry seems to change faster than the personnel in a Chinese restaurant kitchen. ''Very good'' today can turn into a mere ''satisfactory'' in a matter of weeks; such is the speed of the chef's revolving door.
1989-02-17	Restaurants	LEAD: In a little over four years, Orso, the breezy Italian trattoria on West 46th Street, has earned cachet as Broadway's leading theatrical hangout. If after-theater dinner is planned at Orso, chances are the crowd will resemble the roster from a current Playbill.
1989-02-15	National Credit Card Securities	LEAD: The National Credit Card Trust 1989 is offering $750 million worth of debt securities backed by Citibank Visa and Mastercard receivables through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation.
1989-02-13	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Mastercard in U.S.S.R.	LEAD: Mastercard will be the next capitalist tool advertised on Soviet television. The company (along with the Coca-Cola Company) is sponsoring the 14 National Basketball Association games that will be broadcast in the U.S.S.R. beginning later this month. Mastercard/Eurocard is held only by a small number of Soviet citizens who extensively travel abroad, said Richard A.
1989-02-12	"DINING OUT;
Korean Cuisine Arrives in Yonkers"	LEAD: AT last, a restaurant offering Korean food has crossed county lines. But Aria is a find already found. With little advertising and no telphone listing as yet, the place attracts an enthusiastic, mostly Asian clientele that packs the place by 6:30 and doesn't let up until closing time. It's like dining out in
1989-02-11	Incentives Are Heating Up the Credit Card Race	LEAD: Credit card companies are battling for consumer loyalty these days, but in most cases they are not trying to win with lower interest rates, cheaper annual fees or longer grace periods. Instead they are using enhancements - extra features provided free or at a reduced charge.
1989-02-05	"DINING OUT;
Home-Style Fare in Bronxville"	LEAD: SOME diners will find the bentwood chairs and the too-high ceilings with their capacity for noise uncomfortable; but, on balance, Pondfield's convenient location on the southern edge of the main shopping street and not too far from the railroad station, its starched linens and pretty table appointments and tasty, home-style fare all help make this a popular neighborhood dining spot.
1989-02-05	Italian Fare in a Minimalist Setting	LEAD: Danbury has another new restaurant, Ciao. It opened in November on Ives Street, which is being called Restaurant Row locally, and perhaps prematurely, as there are just two other eating establishments on this short street off Liberty Drive.
1989-02-04	For Catholic Charities, A New Credit Card	LEAD: It may be more blessed to give than to receive, but the national office of Catholic Charities has joined the ranks of those proposing to do both at the same time. The organization has started to promote its new Caritas Mastercard, christened with the Latin word for charity or love. Any time Caritas cardholders use their cards, one-half of 1 percent of the sales price will go to Catholic
1989-01-29	Chinese to Eat In or Take Out	LEAD: THE trend toward ethnic take-out food continues unabated, attesting to our national hunger for dining diversity and for decent food that is reasonably priced and quickly prepared - by someone else.
1989-01-27	Restaurants	LEAD: Mitsukoshi
1989-01-15	"DINING OUT;
Italian and Americanized French Fare"	LEAD: After the clamor and excess of the holidays, it's comforting to come across an intimate little restaurant serving pleasing dishes that don't also cost an arm and a leg.
1989-01-15	Ticket Lottery At Meadowlands	LEAD: The Meadowlands has issued rules for the lottery drawing to obtain tickets to the Eastern Regional collegiate basketball tournament there March 24 and 26.
1989-01-15	A Moderately Priced Newcomer	LEAD: IT looks as though Danbury and Stamford are racing to see which city can open the most restaurants in the shortest space of time. Every time diners turn around, a new restaurant has emerged. For quality at moderate prices, however, the edge at this moment would go to Danbury.
1989-01-08	"DINING OUT;
In Thornwood, Hunan Fare Arrives"	LEAD: UP-COUNTY diners interested in what is for the most part carefully prepared Hunan cooking should take note of the recent opening of Hunan Ritz. It replaces the short-lived China Boat in the middle of the Rose Hill Shopping Center. Those familiar with the pink and white linens, dramatic black chairs and the gentle fountain of the former occupant will find them intact.
1989-01-08	Distinctive Chinese in Westport	LEAD: THE discovery of a Chinese restaurant with a style of its own is an auspicious way to welcome the New Year. Tiger Bowl, on the Post Road in Westport near the Fairfield line, boasts a chef and owner from Shanghai.
1989-01-07	Less Mystery in Car Rentals	LEAD: Drivers should find it easier to shop for the lowest rental-car rates this year, and many customers will be able to disregard the industry's puzzling and expensive insurance options, thanks to some new laws, guidelines and credit-card services.
1989-01-01	"DINING OUT;
It's Worth the Search in Lambertville"	LEAD: IT takes the perseverance of a pioneer to find Hamilton's Grill. The six-month-old restaurant, which is a block from the Delaware River, is tucked behind an antiques shop in an alley called the Porkyard, off a side street in the Hunterdon County town of Lambertville. Only a small sign with the restaurant's logo, a blue-and-white grid, at the corner of the alley gives a hint of the charming courtyard at the end.
1989-01-01	TRAVEL ADVISORY	LEAD: Credit Card Widens Plan For Car Renters
1988-12-31	The New-Fashioned Way To Steal Money: Fake Credit	LEAD: The weapon of choice among bank robbers these days is the credit card: it provides them with millions of dollars in cash and products each year.
1988-12-31	Your Money; Finance Planning: Best Time Is Now	LEAD: Unlike those New Year's pledges to shed 15 pounds or do an odd job around the house, resolutions to get one's finances under control actually have a first-of-the-year logic.
1988-12-25	"DINING OUT;
Delightful Fare Put Together With Flair"	LEAD: LAST July 1, the husband and wife team of Wendy Farber and Brooks Niklas opened the doors of their first restaurant, called Park One Eleven, in Ridgewood. The name is due to the fact that the restaurant, which is on the main street in Ridgewood, is also opposite the local park.
1988-12-25	USING CREDIT CARDS TO SAVE MONEY BY SPENDING	LEAD: Business travelers may pay top dollar for service and convenience, but their companies aren't always happy about soaring costs. By last July, travel prices had risen by 4.4 percent, a point above the consumer price index, according to the U.S. Travel Data Center.
1988-12-18	Vietnamese Fare in Old Saybrook	LEAD: VIETNAMESE restaurants have not burst upon the Connecticut dining scene with such force as Thai restaurants have in the past year. Perhaps there is a culinary comment in this: Where Thai food is spicy and incendiary, attracting instant attention, Vietnamese is gentle, subtle and more closely akin to China's
1988-12-16	Asset-Backed Securities Offered by Maryland Bank	LEAD: Maryland Bank N.A. is offering $500 million of asset-backed securities through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The securities are backed by Mastercard and Visa credit card receivables and have an estimated average life of four years.
1988-12-11	"WHAT'S NEW IN BANK THEFT;
High-Tech Heists and Credit Card Capers"	LEAD: William Francis ''Willie'' Sutton Jr.'s oft-repeated reason for robbing banks was ''because that's where the money is.'' Armed with a bagful of disguises, an acetylene torch and a getaway car, the infamous robber hit nearly 100 banks in his career to net an estimated $2 million.
1988-12-11	"WHAT'S NEW IN BANK THEFT;
FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BECOME A CROOK"	LEAD: One recent Friday afternoon, an alert teller in a New York bank noticed that the name on a customer's credit card matched a name on a watch list. The teller delayed the customer while an officer notified the United States Secret Service.
1988-11-20	"DINING OUT;
Contemporary Meets Italian-American"	LEAD: AS you breeze down the western end of Route 208 through Oakland, it would be easy to miss Ruga. But for a smart little neon sign, the restaurant's facade resembles the neighboring houses in a mostly residential section near the Bergen County border.
1988-11-20	1 for Afternoon Tea, 1 for Eggs	LEAD: INVETERATE shoppers who enjoy browsing from town to town in Fairfield County have long lamented the absence of an attractive place in which to have a post-shopping, English-style afternoon tea.
1988-11-18	Mastercard Chooses Los Angeles Banker	LEAD: Mastercard International yesterday chose Alex W. Hart, a banker in Los Angeles, as chief executive of the big credit card association.

The securities are backed by Mastercard and Visa credit-card account receivables.
1988-11-13	"DINING OUT;
Variety in Fare Sets the Tone in Oldwick"	LEAD: THE Tewksbury Inn, which is not actually in Tewksbury but in Oldwick, dates from the early 19th century, and redecorations notwithstanding, it looks pretty much as it must have at the turn of the century.
1988-11-05	American Express Fee On 2 Cards to Rise $10	LEAD: In a time of heated competition in the charge card business, the American Express Company said yesterday that it would raise the fee of its green and gold charge cards $10 a year.
1988-11-04	Restaurants	LEAD: Rogers & Barbero
1988-10-30	"DINING OUT;
Khan's Mongolian Garden"	LEAD: ON Saturday evening, when the Tappan Zee Bridge is spared a rush hour, this place is worth the short and easy ride. Remember it at other times, too, if traffic is at a standstill and a little dinner is all that's required to raise the blood sugar of testy passengers. Consider taking a break over a few dim sum, a bowl of soup and a plate of freshly cooked victuals.
1988-10-30	"DINING OUT;
Surprising Italian Dishes in Clinton"	LEAD: A LITTLE over a year ago, Ann Chamberlain, a science teacher, joined forces with a Hungarian-born chef, Louis Szabo, to open Prego, an Italian restaurant in Clinton, Hunterdon County.
1988-10-30	Going After That First Charge Card	LEAD: WHEN Penny Kaganoff graduated from college, her low-paying editorial position did not qualify her for a credit card. After she married, she used her husband's American Express and Visa cards, deciding not to apply again for credit of her own even when she got a better-paying job.
1988-10-23	"DINING OUT;
Salads, Pasta, Pizza in Eastchester"	LEAD: WESTCHESTER has long been ready for an eating spot like Ciao's. The place offers excellent, stunningly arranged salads, about two dozen pasta dishes, individual and large-sized pizzas and a moderately priced wine list. That is it - the preferred food of today, fresh, light, delicious, healthful. The restaurant has been discovered.
1988-10-23	"DINING OUT;
Eclectic Newcomer in West Caldwell"	LEAD: IT'S not often that an instructor gets to practice what he preaches, but William Decker is doing just that. The former director of the culinary program at Essex County Community College is now executive chef at an ambitious four-month-old restaurant in West Caldwell.

1988-10-19	FOOD NOTES	LEAD: Wines of the Valley
1988-10-16	"DINING OUT;
Seafood Fare and Apt Decor in Somerset"	LEAD: WHEN a restaurant professes to specialize in a particular type of food, one would naturally expect it to cook that food expertly. Unfortunately, this is not always so. The chef at Michelle's Seafood Restaurant in Somerset, for instance, appears to be totally unaware that seafood should not only be immaculately fresh, but also very lightly cooked.
1988-10-16	Sunday? It's Time for Brunch	LEAD: CHAMPAGNE mimosas, eggs Benedict, smoked salmon and even fettuccine Alfredo all spell Sunday brunch at restaurants around New Jersey. Since most of us, because of workaday schedules or cholesterol concerns, don't indulge in substantial breakfasts during the week, that leisurely cross between breakfast and lunch is a popular weekend treat.
1988-10-16	"DINING OUT;
A Neighborhood Place in Eastchester"	LEAD: FOR more years than we care to remember, Luigi's Trattoria occupied this narrow space on white Plains Road. To give the place a new, fresh look, the owners, Maureen and Gerry Houlihan, brightened the restaurant's wine cellar-dark interior with pink walls and gray accents, installed hand-painted tables exploding with color, hung pictures and, perhaps to lighten the image to match the cooking, changed the name to Daniel's, although the restaurant still offers a healthy number of
1988-10-14	Restaurants	LEAD: When you enter the marble and glass lobby of the building at 18 East Broadway in Chinatown, an official-looking woman, wearing a dark blue uniform and holding a walkie-talkie, trots over and inquires, ''Are you here for dinner?'' ''Well, yes, we are.'' ''Take this elevator,'' she beckons, barking orders in Chinese to a command post upstairs.
1988-10-09	"DINING OUT;
Delicious Options on Italian Menu"	LEAD: FROM the outside, Per Forza! could be Basking Ridge's corner luncheonette. In fact, that's what it once was, before becoming a convivial little Italian restaurant a year ago. Inside, the storefront has been spruced up with Art Deco sconces, architectural details and fresh flowers on the snug, white-clothed tables.
1988-10-08	Dining on a Discount Takes a Smaller Bite Out of the Budget	LEAD: When Cathy Hull, a New York freelance illustrator, and her husband go out to dinner, they, like most people these days, usually pay with a credit card. But when their monthly statement arrives, there is a 25 percent reduction in the price of the meal, because the credit card they use is issued by the Transmedia
1988-10-07	Restaurants	LEAD: Eze
1988-10-04	Card Test at Sears	LEAD: Sears, Roebuck & Company plans to test acceptance of Mastercard, Visa and American Express credit cards at some of its stores in addition to its Sears and Discover cards. The tests will involve 12 department stores and 6 paint and hardware stores. Except for two earlier tests in 1979 and 1980, Sears has not accepted either of the major bank cards or the American Express card.
1988-10-04	Banks Catch Mets Fever	LEAD: On the eve of the National League playoffs, Mets fever has spread to the financial industry. Yesterday the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation announced a Mets-linked Mastercard. Besides getting a credit card that sports the Mets' logotype, card holders will be eligible for sweepstakes prizes that include a trip to the Mets' spring training and the use of a Shea Stadium box.
1988-10-03	BUSINESS DIGEST	LEAD: THE ECONOMY The economy grew in September at the slowest pace in six months, the nation's purchasing managers said in their monthly report, adding that industrial production increased at a respectable rate and that orders for exports rose. Many economists and Government officials have been hoping for signs of slower overall growth, out of fear that the economy may overheat.
1988-10-03	Mastercard And Visa: Rival Donors	LEAD: THE never-ending marketing rivalry between the big bank credit cards is not just over fees and perquisites. It is over ''causes,'' too.
1988-10-02	"DINING OUT;
Inventive Dishes in Maplewood"	LEAD: ONE of my sternest critics asserts that I prefer small restaurants to large ones. While this is not exactly true, I do confess that I feel like an explorer when I first visit a small unknown restaurant. The hope that this one will be worth the trek into the hinterlands and that the now unknown chef will be the next culinary star is a strong incentive to continue, even though past experience has shown that some small restaurants are so awful they are virtually unreviewable.
1988-10-02	A French Restaurant Turns Italian	LEAD: USUALLY when restaurants are not doing well, they go out of business. La Plume in Bethel has tried a different approach: it changed its name to Pappagallo's and its cuisine from formal French to informal Italian. What remains the same is the cast of characters - the chef and owners - and the locale - an 1850
1988-10-02	Credit Cards	LEAD: To the Editor: Betsy Wade's article on credit card problems (Practical Traveler, Aug. 7) was very informative. I would like to add a piece of advice that my husband and I have found helpful. He applied for a MasterCard in his name and I applied for a Visa card in my name. He carries the MasterCard and I carry the Visa.
1988-09-30	Mastercard Fee Increase	LEAD: Mastercard International, the credit card company, this week announced a rate increase affecting the banks that handle the transactions for a merchant after a consumer makes a Mastercard purchase.
1988-09-25	"DINING OUT;
Staying Power in Yorktown"	LEAD: SITUATED in a sparsely populated area of the county, the Lakeside Restaurant should be congratuated for its staying power. It has been there as long as we can remember, through its several ownerships remaining a humble establishment of limited accomplishment, delivering to a neighborhood clientele hefty, straightforward cuisine in equally hefty portion.
1988-09-25	"DINING OUT;
East-West Fare Mixes in Madison"	LEAD: A CONCEPT that is gaining popularity is the marriage of Eastern and Western cuisines. Cutting-edge restaurants in California and Manhattan are combining the flavors and artistry of Asia with European techniques and American ingredients. And so word of a brand new restaurant in Madison offering Japanese
1988-09-25	When You Need to Send Cash in a Flash	LEAD: THERE are numerous reasons why someone may need to transmit cash in a flash. A son or daughter is stranded with a broken-down car and not enough money to get it fixed. A spouse extends the length of a trip because of unforeseen circumstances. A wallet is lost on a vacation or a business trip. These are just some of the unfortunate situations requiring money to be sent immediately.
1988-09-25	A Traditional Japanese Menu	LEAD: If you expect the new Sakura in Stamford to be a clone of its parent restaurant in Westport, you are in for a surprise and a pleasant one. Not only is the new offspring more attractive, spacious and authentically Japanese in decor, but the food is better and more attractively presented, the sushi is fresher and the menu is considerably expanded and more interesting.
1988-09-18	From the Drought to the 'Kiddie Tax'	LEAD: Below are answers to recent questions from readers of the Personal Finance column.
1988-09-15	Drexel Defense Set to Attack Boesky	LEAD: Court filings this week by defendants in the Drexel Burnham Lambert securities fraud case strongly suggest that their defense will be based on an assault on the credibility of the Government's main witness, Ivan F. Boesky.
1988-09-12	Citicorp to Buy Texas Credit Card Business	LEAD: Citicorp will acquire the credit card business of the former First Republicbank Corporation from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for $159 million.
1988-09-09	Restaurants	LEAD: Mondrian
1988-09-04	"DINING OUT;
Southern Cooking in in Tuckahoe"	LEAD: FOR those who miss Manhattan dining, a visit to Coastal North should help satisfy the longing. This spinoff from the owners' three city restaurants is not only big, slick and glitzy but also jammed with tables spaced too closely together, particularly those for two. While the menu is trendy, dishes are turned out with some thought; apparently the kitchen of this mainly fish house has taken the trouble to time the delicate creatures carefully, and we found them not only pristinely fresh but cooked properly.
1988-09-04	A New Style for an Old Inn	LEAD: LONGTIME patrons of the old Roger Sherman Inn in New Canaan will be pleased at some of the changes wrought by the new ownership, formerly of the Inn at Ridgefield.
1988-08-28	Some Light Fare in Hartford	LEAD: IN the vanguard of the grilled meats-and-fish trend, Congress Rotisserie has been a moderately priced mainstay of Hartford since it first opened its doors three years ago.
1988-08-27	COPING: With Finances for Students	LEAD: Though Personal Finance 101 may not be in the curriculum, the first year of college can be a test for students and their families on such matters as bank accounts, credit cards and insurance policies.
1988-08-21	"DINING OUT;
Chinese Elegance in Woodbridge"	LEAD: IT'S easy to miss Orchids in Woodbridge, tucked away as it is in a tiny shopping center that is neither highly visible nor easily accessible. It is worthwhile persevering because the attractive eight-month-old Chinese restaurant serves food that is above average.
1988-08-21	"NUMISMATICS;
A New Scholarly Reference Book for the Home Library"	LEAD: MANY important coin books have appeared in recent years. None, perhaps, is more comprehensive or more significant than ''Walter Breen's Complete Encyclopedia of United States and Colonial Coins,'' published by Doubleday.
1988-08-21	Small but Special in Westport	LEAD: THE storefront space long occupied by Pearl's in Westport is now a charming Italian restaurant called Da Pietro, after its owner and chef, Pietro Scotti.
1988-08-19	Restaurants	LEAD: The cast of dining spots along restaurant row in the Broadway theater district (West 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues) has changed dramatically in recent years. Once primarily a collection of family-run French bistros, it has become a medley that also features Italian, regional American and Oriental spots, some of which change identities as frequently as
1988-08-14	"DINING OUT;
Chinese Elegance in Woodbridge"	LEAD: IT'S easy to miss Orchids in Woodbridge, tucked away as it is in a tiny shopping center that is neither highly visible nor easily accessible. It is worthwhile persevering because the attractive eight-month-old Chinese restaurant serves food that is above average.
1988-08-14	Classic French in New Milford	LEAD: FROM a diner's perspective, the Northwest Corner is slowly becoming livelier, perhaps partially due to the influx of new weekend residents and summer visitors.
1988-08-12	Brash Clubs or Haute Cuisine For Sultry Summer Nights	LEAD: IN this summer of discontent for so many restaurants and clubs, not all is gloom and thunder. Sure, Il Palazzo has gone belly up. Maxwell's Plum has succumbed. Nobody talks about Nell's or Bice anymore, and there are empty banquettes at the Four Seasons and the Quilted Giraffe. But the Darwinian struggle rages on, and, while the pace has slowed, the fickle populace still has an insatiable taste for adventure.
1988-08-07	"DINING OUT;
Japanese Cuisine in North Tarrytown"	LEAD: As one pulls up to this neat little restaurant, black and red Japanese characters painted on the white wall announce that one is about to enter Sushi Raku (''Sushi For Your Pleasure''), and the name could't be more accurate. This friendly dining spot is a welcome sight on the northwestern flank of the county until now deprived of this popular cuisine.
1988-08-05	Restaurants	LEAD: The Lincoln Center area still suffers from a relatively lackluster cast of restaurants, considering the demand for quality dining before and after performances. Several promising places have opened in the neighborhood over the last year, but none so far rivals five-year-old Cafe Luxembourg for its consistently appealing fare and kinetic ambiance.
1988-07-29	Restaurants	LEAD: Late July may not be the most opportune time to talk about a steakhouse - as the temperature soars, thoughts often turn to salads and seafood -but Brandywine is a special place, and the summer menu there is varied enough to offer something for all tastes.
1988-07-17	"DINING OUT;
A Fresh Twist in Cape May"	LEAD: THERE must be something in the sea air in Cape May that sparks the appetite because dining in the Victorian resort is a major pastime. Restaurants of many ethnic stripes, from Thai to soul, dot the downtown blocks.
1988-07-16	The High, and Secret, Cost of Car Rental	LEAD: Once it was simple to find the best deal on a rental car. ''What's the rate? Is there a mileage charge?'' were all you had to ask. Today it helps to think like an insurance underwriter, or maybe a detective.
1988-07-15	BUSINESS DIGEST	LEAD: THE ECONOMY Major banks raised their prime lending rate to 9 1/2 percent, from 9 percent, confirming the recent trend toward higher rates. The second increase in the prime this year brought it to its highest level since March 1986. The increase may affect consumer spending but is unlikely to be a major drag on the economy.
1988-07-15	Mastercard President Says He Will Resign	LEAD: In a move that surprised the credit card industry, Russell E. Hogg said yesterday that he would resign as president and chief executive of Mastercard International.
1988-07-08	Diner's Journal	LEAD: A Neighborhood Haunt New York City is filled with unassuming little neighborhood haunts that rarely if ever get press attention, and they get along just fine without it.
1988-07-05	Credit-Card Tie to Nonprofit Groups	LEAD: A few weeks ago, about 100,000 people on the Museum of American Folk Art's mailing list were asked to sign up for a Mastercard or Visa credit card in an arrangement that will benefit the museum every time the card is used. The offer came through Maryland Bank N.A., which like other banks sees the program as a way to gain accounts.
1988-07-03	"DINING OUT;
Country Surroundings in Pawling"	LEAD: TRAVELERS returning from Berkshire weekends, perhaps with the sublime strains of Tanglewood still in their ears, will find little along Route 22 between Patterson and Hillsdale to compete with the elegant picnics they've had for lunch. Along this way, paved with fast-food slingeries, the Meeting House won't answer any prayers for elegant food, but the place is informal, sweetly though not elaborately decorated in country
1988-06-26	"DINING OUT;
A Change of Names in Meyersville"	LEAD: PERHAPS the building that houses Truffles, a restaurant in the Morris County community of Meyersville, will always be known as ''the place where The Tarragon Tree used to be.'' After all, The Tarragon Tree made New Jersey culinary history.
1988-06-26	Taxpayers' Option: The Credit Card	LEAD: SOME Connecticut municipalities say they have seen the tax-paying future, and it's plastic. And the future is now in more and more places.
1988-06-25	Tightening Controls Over Sales by Phone	LEAD: All Jolaine Viskoe had to do was buy 12 boxes of vitamins, the salesman said over the telephone, and she would receive one of the following: a car, a trip, a valuable lithograph or $5,000.
1988-06-22	Manufacturers Hanover Unit In a $475 Million Offering	LEAD: A Manufacturers Hanover Corporation subsidiary is offering $475 million of debt securities backed by a pool of Visa and Mastercard credit card receivables through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc.
1988-06-19	"DINING OUT;
Continental Cuisine in Rumson"	LEAD: IN RESIDENTIAL Rumson, where the competition sports names such as Hook, Line and Sinker and What's Your Beef, Fromagerie shines like a beacon.
1988-06-19	"DINING OUT;
Country Lodge in Postcard Setting"	LEAD: IT would be difficult to name a place for summer dining as perfect as the Long Pond Inn (more a spruced-up, rustic lodge). This charming country restaurant celebrates its fourth birthday this month and deserves to live to be 100. Inside, pine paneling glows from the diffused light of candle lamps and glittery wall sconces.
1988-06-12	"DINING OUT;
Mexican Fare Off the Saw Mill"	LEAD: LONG situated on the Saw Mill River Parkway, Cantina couldn't be handier. From its bosky outdoor dining terraces and bar, one looks upon a pretty lake busy with wildlife. Indoors, a fireplace makes a cozy focal point on winter evenings, and banks of greenery soften the attractive contemporary dining spaces of wood and stone.
1988-06-12	TRAVEL ADVISORY	LEAD: Roadwork Slows Airport Traffic In Minneapolis
1988-06-05	DELAWARE INC.	LEAD: ON JAN. 3, 1986, THE READERS OF THE ASIAN EDITION of The Wall Street Journal were treated to an arresting full-page advertisement. Topped by a smiling photograph of S. B. (for Shien Biau) Woo, the Lieutenant Governor of Delaware, who is also the state's highest-ranking elected Democrat, the highest-ranking Chinese-American official in the United States and a physicist, the ad posed two questions.
1988-05-29	Informal Dining in Westport	LEAD: ONE of the newer eateries in Westport, 3 Bay Street (subtitled ''an American Grille''), is the kind of drop-in place that can be very appealing in a small community. A friendly staff and a simple, attractive menu make for an informal alternative to fancier, special-occasion dining.
1988-05-28	Your Money; Financial Advice For Graduates	LEAD: When Edward W. Barrett was dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism in the 1950's and 60's, he liked to give a special talk just before graduation. His advice to those about to embark on their careers: ''Start a go-to-hell fund.''
1988-05-27	Restaurants	LEAD: Periyali Think of Greek food, as represented in the archipelago of New York, and the cliches abound: twirling gyros of gray lamb and foil-wrapped pita bread at sidewalk stalls; clattering coffee shops where taciturn waiters wear too-tight red vests and perpetual 5 o'clock shadows; stucco-and-plastic-flowered dining rooms specializing in skewered lamb, moussaka and mountains of iceberg lettuce with feta.
1988-05-22	"DINING OUT;
A Fresh New Spirit in Bayonne"	LEAD: BAYONNE is known for its many churches, its petrochemical industry and, according to the Chamber of Commerce, for being the second-safest city in New Jersey. But even its civic boosters do not claim Bayonne as a mecca for innovative dining, and so it got our attention when readers mentioned a new restaurant there serving imaginative Italian food.
1988-05-22	For Those Who Like It Hot	LEAD: THAI cuisine was a natural to succeed Cajun as the hot trend. As American appetites have been energized for spicy foods, the need was met by Mexican, then Sichuan and Hunan, followed by Cajun and now comes the incendiary cooking of Thailand.
1988-05-15	Host's Guide to Outdoor Cafes	LEAD: IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT RESTAURANTS TODAY are part sustenance and part showmanship, not always in equal proportion. And nowhere is the theater of dining more vibrant than in outdoor cafes, whether on a bustling urban thoroughfare, in a salt-sprayed seaside village or deep in a sylvan glade. An outdoor terrace or garden can make an ideal setting for warm-weather entertaining.
1988-05-14	Your Money; More People Seek Credit Counseling	LEAD: When Luther R. Gatling opened a credit-counseling service in New York City 11 years ago, most of his clients had blue-collar jobs and earned relatively low wages.
1988-05-01	A Rose Grows in the Hamptons	LEAD: A RED neon rose sporting a single leaf and solitary prominent thorn glows in the window of C. J. Thorne in Bridgehampton. This sophisticated yet mellow new restaurant has one of those made-up-sounding names that usually mark yuppie watering holes.
1988-04-24	"DINING OUT;
Fancy French Fare in Fairfield"	LEAD: NOW YOU see them and now you don't.
1988-04-24	"DINING OUT;
A Japanese Arrival in Mt. Kisco"	LEAD: TO the delight of residents of northern Westchester, Japanese restaurants have been moving, albeit all too slowly, to higher, sushi-starved latitudes. Mount Kisco is the locale of the newcomer Toku, a restaurant and sushi bar.
1988-04-15	Restaurants	LEAD: Parioli, Romanissimo Strand for strand, Parioli, Romanissimo is New York's most expensive Italian restaurant. A three-course meal with the most humble wine easily tops $80 a person before tax and tip, and if your blood runs hot for appetizers like risotto with wild mushrooms ($26) and such entrees as rack of veal ($64 for two), tack another digit onto the total.
1988-04-10	"DINING OUT;
Those Neighborhood Trattorias"	LEAD: ONE OF the things that New Jersey does best is the little neighborhood trattoria.
1988-04-10	"DINING OUT;
Wholesome Granite Springs Fare"	LEAD: PAMELA and Ron (Fritz) Lunge have hit their stride, and, after a shaky opening three years ago, Fritz's in Granite Springs is running smoothly. This is the kind of restaurant the county needs more of. A mural of giant pastel irises has a floral motif bolstered by loads of dried, fake and fresh flower arrangements that soften the boxy angles of the dining room.
1988-04-08	Restaurants	LEAD: WHEN Arcadia was first reviewed in 1985, Anne Rosenzweig was an anonymous young chef who was delighting customers with her eclectic and intelligently assembled American cooking. Before long, as is so often the case, the trend-starved media machine grabbed her and pumped her up larger than a helium-filled character in the Macy's
1988-03-27	"DINING OUT;
A Challenge for a New Proprietor"	LEAD: WHEN Dennis Foy's popular Chatham restaurant, The Tarragon Tree, closed its doors on New Year's Day, it was disappointing news indeed for area diners. It seems that Mr. Foy plans to fulfill a long-time dream of entering the Manhattan restaurant fray by launching Park Place on East 59th Street next month.
1988-03-27	"DINING OUT;
American Cuisine in Mamaroneck"	LEAD: Open four months, The Good Life not only shows promise but brings to the area light new American cooking that just escapes being trendy. While this newcomer is most welcome, one has the impression that the place should be and, with a little more practice, could be better than it is. The items on the small menu indicate that the kitchen has the imagination to venture beyond currently fashionable preprations to more ambitious renditions; however, at this time, good as they are, dishes manage to be successful only in part.
1988-03-18	Restaurants	LEAD: CENTURIES before the neologism grazing was coined to describe hit-and-run eaters, the Spanish were doing just that at their tascas, convivial restaurants where a copious display of appetizers, called tapas, were lined up along the bar. So it should be no surprise to Rufino Lopez, a native of Galicia in northwestern Spain, that nomadic nibblers are flocking to his inviting new restaurant,
1988-03-13	A Cozy Setting for French Cuisine	LEAD: IN recent months, Fairfield County has been blessed with the opening of several fine restaurants. Now add L'Hotellerie des Bois (Little Hotel in the Woods) in West Redding to the growing list.
1988-03-11	Where Two Can Dine for Under $50	LEAD: DINNER for two in the average New York restaurant has broken the three-digit barrier, and with a little imagination when it comes to wine, the damages could easily surpass $150. Add to that expense drinks before dinner, miscellaneous service tips, the coat check fees, cab fare, maybe a baby sitter and a trip to the dry cleaner afterward to get that chocolate stain out of your new silk tie, and you may resort to looting the Christmas
1988-03-06	"DINING OUT;
A New Life for an Old Inn"	LEAD: OPENING and operating a restaurant is a difficult enough job for a seasoned professional with years of experience. However, when a young man barely out of his teens and with little experience in the world of restaurants, turns an old Sussex County inn that was hardly more than a beer-and-shot place into a restaurant as charming as the Inn at Stillwater, then he's already won part of the battle.
1988-02-28	Revival for Serino's in New Haven	LEAD: SERINO'S, that fine, cozy Italian restaurant in Branford, has moved to New Haven. Its new venue is the former home of another familiar Italian restaurant, the long departed and lamented L'Avventura.
1988-02-28	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: In Rye, Clothing At Up to 75% Off The Bay Window in Rye has reductions of up to 75 percent on winter clearance merchandise in its upstairs sale room. Separates, turtlenecks, gloves, sweaters, dressy dresses, evening gowns, belts and pantyhose are available. In addition, through March it offers 20 percent reductions on sterling silver and other jewelry from downstairs and on Regina
1988-02-19	Restaurants	LEAD: THERE are only a handful of restaurants in the Lincoln Center area where I could be persuaded to pass an evening unless I was at the business end of a revolver. At first I had reservations about the newcomer Cameos, a splashy, pastel-hued, piano bar with an overly energetic public-relations staff.
1988-02-14	OH MY CRACKING PISTONS!	LEAD: I GAVE THE WOMAN A CHECK FOR $500, drove off in her '74 Datsun and left behind a whole life style. That was two years ago. Up to then, the only cars I had ever owned were Porsches. But as I wound the steep slopes of western Connecticut on my way home, my mind wasn't heavy with comparisons of hill power, or rack and pinions or swaybars.
1988-02-10	"Market Place;
Purchasing Gold: Big Price Range"	LEAD: ACCORDING to Citibank's Precious Metals Center, 75 percent of the bank's sales of gold coins in 1987 came after the stock market's Oct. 19 collapse as nervous investors flocked to the world's traditional ''disaster insurance.''
1988-02-10	Advertising; Visa Aims At American Express	LEAD: LIKE the cola and beer wars, credit card marketing has never been a gentle business. Consider the current Visa International campaign, which is tied to the Winter Olympics and takes dead aim at American Express.
1988-02-05	Restaurants	LEAD: AFTER four visits to Aquavit, the dramatic new Scandinavian restaurant in the former John D. Rockefeller town house on West 54th Street, I'm still hard-pressed to define this northern cuisine. Indeed, some of the ingredients are exotic - cloudberries, bleak roe, snow grouse - but the style of cooking, at least in this urbane establishment, is unmistakably French.
1988-02-04	Spending Lag Stirring Few Worries	LEAD: American consumers have been keeping a tighter grip on their wallets, but a close analysis of recent data and interviews with business people and consumers suggest there is little prospect that spending will fall far enough or long enough to end the nation's economic expansion, now in its sixth year.
1988-01-31	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"LEAD: 
Big Markdowns At Chappaqua Shop 
This That & More in Chappaqua has 20 to 50 percent markdowns through Feb. 13 on a variety of goods. The sale items include handloomed scarves and sweaters; fringed lace shawls; metallic, beaded, fabric and skin evening bags; one-of-a-kind leather jackets with Japanese kimono insets and leather and suede tops; beaded lace blouses and coordinated lace-trimmed velvet skirts; leather gloves, belts and handbags; and sterling Art Deco Austrian crystal jewelry."
1988-01-24	N.C.A.A. Ticket Lottery	LEAD: The National Collegiate Athletic Association's Eastern Regional basketball tournament at Byrne Meadowlands Arena March 24 and March 26 will allocate tickets by lottery.
1988-01-22	Restaurants	LEAD: THE palatial home of the former Quo Vadis restaurant on East 63d Street was beginning to get the reputation of being cursed.
1988-01-17	"DINING OUT;
Italian Fare Offered in Irvington"	LEAD: HISTORY does repeat itself, but usually at a higher price. Certainly the menu at Peregrine's is a perfect case in point.
1988-01-10	"DINING OUT;
PUZZLES THAT A MENU CAN PRESENT"	LEAD: MENU language in Chinese restaurants is often as delicious as the dishes described. Imagine, for instance, the dish that would be served if the following description were exact:
1988-01-01	Restaurants	LEAD: ZARELA MARTINEZ'S stewardship of nearly three years at the whimsical Mexican restaurant Cafe Marimba ended abruptly in September when the owner, David Keh, converted all his restaurants back to Chinese. The feisty Ms. Martinez wasted no time gathering her pots, pans and jalapenos and opening her own place, called Zarela, in the former Tastings on Two on Second Avenue.
1987-12-27	BEHIND SOME BRIGHT IDEAS OF '87	LEAD: A wonder drug for heart-attack victims. A book of zany but thought-provoking questions. Exciting advances in superconductivity. Buying postage stamps by phone.
1987-12-22	PATTERNS	LEAD: Winds of Change
1987-12-20	"DINING OUT;
PIANO-BAR SPOT IN WHITE PLAINS"	LEAD: PATRONS who remember the tacky interior of this longtime restaurant and bar are in for a pleasant surprise. Reopened after a three-month renovation, the place has been partly gutted, replastered, repainted and receilinged with skylights. An exposed brick wall, dark grass-green carpeting and trellises against shades of rose and butterscotch suggest the garden, no doubt the ''secret'' tucked beyond the bar.
1987-12-16	Life in the 30's	LEAD: I AM going to a business lunch, and I look good.
1987-12-13	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"LEAD: 
Gems, Talking Clocks And Ivory Figurines 
Reyman Jewelers has been in business in Mount Vernon since 1895, in the same location since 1967, and is now run by the fourth generation of the same family."
1987-12-13	"DINING OUT;
PAUL MA COMES TO CROSS RIVER"	LEAD: DINERS familiar with Paul Ma's China Kitchen in Yorktown Heights will be pleased to know that Mr. Ma has opened a second, spiffier restaurant in Cross River, one marked by a luxury of space, dramatically high ceilings and comfortable chairs. Situated in the angle of Cross River Plaza, this new dining spot brings to another part of the county pleasing aspects of the old: a personal rendition of Shandong cooking, thought to be the richest, most varied and oldest of Chinese regional cuisines (Mr.
1987-12-13	Affinity Cards	LEAD: To the Editor:
1987-12-12	Stakes Rising in the Credit Card Game	LEAD: With one credit card, consumers can make a purchase and a donation to a favorite charity simultaneously. With another, card holders receive a discount when buying skiing equipment or horseback riding. With other cards, the user accumulates bonus miles on frequent flier plans.
1987-12-06	"DINING OUT;
JAPANESE CUISINE IN ARDSLEY"	LEAD: OPEN three months on the spot last occupied by Sushi Kin, Roppongi - named after the entertainment district of Tokyo - follows the genre, offering a full range of dishes from the kitchen and the sushi bar. The products from the kitchen at this time have not achieved the high level of accomplishment shown in the creations issuing from the sushi bar; cooked dishes should be ordered with care.
1987-12-06	"DINING OUT;
THE JAPANESE TOUCH IN TEANECK"	LEAD: SOMETIMES in the midst of the formalities and rich fare of the holidays, one yearns for the light dishes and casual atmosphere of an Oriental restaurant. Just in time, an outpost of the Manhattan Japanese restaurants called East has opened in Teaneck.
1987-12-06	Pricey Services	LEAD: To the Editor:
1987-12-04	A Dining Strategy For Before and After A Broadway Play	LEAD: ORCHESTRATING a night on the town, such as dinner and a show, is much like directing a play. The script may be solid, the casting superb, the set inspiring - but if your timing is off, the whole effort collapses like a leaky balloon.
1987-11-27	Restaurants	LEAD: THE cross-pollination of Eastern and Western cuisines over the last decade has spawned some electrifying food, particularly by leading proponents of contemporary California-style cuisine. One of the most impressive practitioners of this genre in California is Wolfgang Puck, whose Chinois on Main in Santa Monica blends the esthetics of Oriental cuisines with the whimsy of so-called New American cooking.
1987-11-22	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Bounty at a Boutique Called Nicole Favella Nicole Favella is a new boutique in Larchmont that features French- , Italian- and some American-made women's shoes, boots, belts and handbags, leather fashions, evening wear and jewelry. The owners have a Madison Avenue shop called La Difference with a similar range.
1987-11-19	TWO BOOKS WILL BE SOLD	LEAD: At least two versions of the Iran-contra committees' report will be available to the public.
1987-11-15	CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: New Books: For Sale And Discussion Next Sunday at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York at Purchase a book-signing reception and a discussion of new books by Dick Higgins, Warren Lehrer, Judy Tomkins and Richard Martin will take place beginning at 3 P.M. The $4 admission fee is applicable toward the purchase price of any featured book (the fee is $2 to Friends of the Neuberger Museum and $1 for State University students, faculty and staff).
1987-11-15	Raised Consumer Consciousness Can Lower Credit-Card Interest	LEAD: To the Editor:
1987-11-15	WINNING FRANCO-RUSSIAN ENTENTE	LEAD: WOODMERE can now boast one of the best new restaurants to open on Long Island in recent years. The food at La Petite Maison Russe harks back to the old Franco-Russian alliance, when Russian Czars imported French chefs. This small storefront restaurant has reversed those roles. The chefs are Russian.
1987-11-06	Restaurants	LEAD: GREAT SHANGHAI RESTAURANT is a bustling Chinatown spot that specializes in the maritime cuisine of the south called Soo-Hang. The extensive menu carries a little of everything, however, from the familiar to the exotic - and the overall quality is impressive.
1987-11-04	In Search of a Meal Near Javits Center? Good. Read This.	LEAD: More than 2 million conventioneers pass through the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center each year (85 percent of them from out of town), and they need the doggedness of an archeologist to uncover interesting dining spots amid the industrial tundra surrounding the center. The year-and-a-half-old structure at 11th Avenue and 34th Street is hardly at the epicenter of
1987-11-01	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"LEAD: 
Playtime Closeout: Up to 50% Off 
Playtime Toys and Bicycles in Larchmont is going out of business with a closeout sale Monday through Saturday this week, but the same owner's Bronxville store remains open under the name Robert's Toytown."
1987-11-01	ITALIAN FOOD IN AN UNLIKELY SPOT	LEAD: GREAT RIVER, known for trees, country clubs, the Connetquot River and nearby Heckscher State Park, is an unlikely spot for a restaurant. Monte Cristo Italian Restaurant and a nearby deli are the only beacons of light, as early autumn darkness settles among the houses and trees.
1987-10-30	Restaurants	LEAD: WHEN the Harry Cipriani restaurant in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel closed abruptly eight weeks ago in a landlord dispute, many of its soigne patrons trotted down to the family's other celebrity corral, Bellini by Cipriani, on Seventh Avenue at 51st Street. This five-month-old clone was still fine tuning its engine when the new wave of customers arrived, requiring the opening of a new downstairs dining room.
1987-10-28	Gifts By Mail, Made In New England	LEAD: OUR passion for handmade products extends to food: the cheese made in someone's shed, the cookies baked in batches of 50. We are certain that handmade food is better than the mass-produced variety, and we are usually right.
1987-10-25	"DINING OUT;
CHINESE CUISINE IN WHITE PLAINS"	LEAD: MOST people pass the narrow storefront entrance of Hunan Avenue without noticing it at all - a pity, because the place deserves attention for several reasons. Hunan Avenue's food is nicely wrought, inventive and prettily presented. Furthermore, although the place is popular at lunch, the restaurant's low profile keeps it relatively empty at the dinner hour when the office crowd abandons the business district of White Plains for home, thus making Hunan Avenue a good choice for diners who, particularly on weekends, find more visible eating spots noisy and packed.
1987-10-25	IN SPIRIT OF LEGENDARY GOURMAND	LEAD: AROUND the turn of the century, a 647-pound fire chief named Barney ran a bar-hotel in Locust Valley. Today, that bar-hotel building is a fashionable restaurant that keeps alive Barney's legend as the largest fire chief in Nassau County's history.
1987-10-18	"DINING OUT;
>A TASTE OF INDIA IN MORRISTOWN"	LEAD: ''IT'S WORTH the wait,'' said a departing diner as he pushed his way through the crowd of people waiting to be seated at Chand Palace in Morristown one recent Saturday evening. ''It'' - very good Indian food -is indeed worth the wait.

ROADHOUSE FARE NEAR BREWSTER"	LEAD: IF the ultimate success of a restaurant can be measured by the volume of its return business, then the recently opened S. W. Lauren's is here to stay despite its modest ambience and uneven kitchen. Bargain prices and fresh ingredients are hard to pass up, and the kitchen's victories, though few, are impressive.
1987-10-11	SERIOUS FOOD IN A FRENETIC SCENE	LEAD: FOR the last few months, Syosset has been buzzing over Mim's, a hip new Manhattan-style restaurant. First impressions include neon, potted palms and old-fashioned wicker chairs in the window. But, 10 feet inside the restaurant, the decor ends and the scene begins. Straight wooden chairs replace the wicker; plants disappear; walls and lighting are stark.
1987-10-11	Thailand	LEAD: To the Editor: I wish to alert travelers to Thailand about a recent credit card scam in which I was a victim.
1987-10-04	"DINING OUT;
RIVER VIEW IN COLD SPRING"	LEAD: ON balmy evenings the old river town of Cold Spring lifts the spirits. Beneath the looming shoulders of Storm King Mountain, the riding lights of freighters and the long shadows of hulls float silently down the friendly river in the dusk, and darting speedboats cross and recross their paths.
1987-10-04	CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Flowers and Glassware At Cut Prices Flowers by Frank Laning in Chappaqua instituted a half-price Flower Market six years ago that continues to draw customers from 4 P.M. to 6 P.M.

1987-09-30	CHEFS FIND FAME BUT NO FORTUNES IN ADS	LEAD: AMERICAN chefs are discovering what athletes have long known: that celebrity can be easily transformed into the coin of the realm. From Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters to Andre Soltner and Anne Rosenzweig, chefs are being courted to endorse not only food and cooking equipment but credit cards and telephone companies.
1987-09-29	Credit Card Receivables By First Chicago Unit	LEAD: A subsidiary of the First Chicago Corporation is offering $800 million of securities backed by credit card receivables through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers.

Plentiful Servings Of Dinnerware"
1987-09-27	LE CROISIC: MEMORIES OF BRITTANY	LEAD: RESTAURATEURS, like boat owners, often name their pride and joy after something close to their hearts. Le Croisic, a six-month-old restaurant in Miller Place, is also the name of a village in Brittany. Le Croisic was the home of the owner's grandmother and the scene of summer memories from his boyhood.
1987-09-20	Visa Goes For The Gold	LEAD: THE DAY WAS DAMP AND DREARY, A perfect match for Robert R. Prazmark's mood. Ordinarily, the 31-year-old vice president of ISL Marketing, U.S.A. Inc., a sports marketing firm, was the very portrait of a confident young executive: tall, trim, composed. But on this November afternoon in Manhattan two years ago,
1987-09-20	"DINING OUT;
AMERICAN FARE IN PEEKSKILL"	LEAD: A WELCOME addition to downtown Peekskill's rehabilitated avenues is Susan's Restaurant & Bad Bill's Bar. Situated in one of the prettily renovated brick-faced storefronts, the restaurant's pleasantly aggressive Americanness makes an ideal counterpoint to the menu's offerings. The decorative brass pots and pans, calico accents, wooden pigs and cows set a fitting stage for enjoyment of Susan's fruit desserts and daily roasts.
1987-09-20	ANOTHER CULINARY JOURNEY TO JAPAN	LEAD: JAPANESE-FOOD fans in the Danbury area should be jubilant. There are now three Japanese restaurants in the vicinity, and each has its own character and specialties.
1987-09-16	First the Bargains And Then the Food	LEAD: ONCE upon a time everyone paid full price for their clothing and household goods. That was before wholesale establishments gathered, often under the same roof, to offer merchandise at discounted prices.
1987-09-16	An Old-Fashioned Store With a Modern Touch	LEAD: New Yorkers are accustomed to food stores that deliver, but the service is not common in New Jersey. It is all the more interesting, then, to find a store like Kaufelt's in Summit, where the owners say they make house calls.
1987-09-13	"DINING OUT;
Something Jersey City Could Use"	LEAD: IF THERE is one thing that burgeoning Jersey City would welcome for its influx of upwardly mobile young residents, it is a first-rate restaurant or two. And although early word of interesting food at the handsome new Henderson Town House was promising, recent samplings have found that its could use a little upward mobility itself, especially with main-course prices averaging about $18.
1987-09-13	"DINING OUT;
INFORMAL UPCOUNTY SPOT FOR PASTA"	LEAD: A REQUEST we often receive, particularly from upcounty readers, is for the name of a pleasant but informal restaurant where one can drop in, without making an evening of it, for a dish of decent pasta and a glass of wine. A newcomer to the area, La Scala appears to be just what readers have ordered.
1987-09-13	YONKERS BUSINESS SPEEDY PERFORMER	LEAD: WHEN Michael H. Coden was 20, newly graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his total assets were $18 in cash and a one-way plane ticket to California.

1987-09-11	Restaurants	LEAD: MY experiences in most health-club restaurants lead me to suspect that their chefs are quietly in cahoots with the asparagus-thin aerobics instructors, whose job it is to inflict pain and help patrons shed weight. It was with such limited expectations that I first jogged over to the new dining spot called Manhattan Island on the third floor of the Manhattan Plaza Health Club on West 43d Street, a short walk from both Broadway and Off
1987-09-09	For the Best in Dining, Look to the Suburbs	LEAD: With 7,600 farms and 750 dairies producing silvery corn, lush tomatoes, berries and more, New Jersey is clearly the Garden State. But the fine-dining state? Home of premium vineyards and hearty ethnic fare? To outsiders, this is where the garden turned desert. If ever true, it is no longer -New Jersey is alive with culinary riches, which The Living Section explores this week and next.
1987-09-05	TELEPHONE CALLS BY CREDIT CARD	LEAD: The American Credit Card Telephone Company said it plans to offer a new service that would allow customers to charge long-distance telephone calls to major credit cards from any public or private touch-tone phone.
1987-09-02	FOOD NOTES	LEAD: Environmental Systems, a company in Lancaster, Pa., has developed a method of producing fresh eggs that have a lower cholesterol content than normal eggs: about 190 to 200 milligrams each, as against about 275 milligrams in a regular egg. The eggs also have fewer calories - about 60, instead of 80 - and are somewhat higher in protein.
1987-08-30	"DINING OUT;
A DISCOVERY IN WALLINGTON"	LEAD: ESSENCE is the kind of place that restaurant reviewers love to discover - the proverbial hole in the wall or, in this case, modest roadhouse serving creative, often first-rate, food at uninflated prices.
1987-08-24	Sports World Specials; Stuffed Superstition	LEAD: A rabbit's foot has long been considered a good luck charm, but when it comes to such superstitions, Val Skinner is a golfer who doesn't go in for halfway measures.
1987-08-23	TRAVEL ADVISORY	LEAD: Inoculations At the 11th Hour
1987-08-16	"DINING OUT;
DUTCH-INDONESIAN IN MAMARONECK"	LEAD: ONE in a handful of interesting eating spots to open recently is Luke's, bringing to the county some Dutch cooking from the owners Linda and Luke Teurlinckx. Under a somewhat deceptive rotisserie chicken sign - for the place often serves more and better than that - the storefront restaurant is hardly more than 10 feet wide and easy to miss.
1987-08-16	TRAVEL ADVISORY	LEAD: Floating Jitney For Amsterdam Museumgoers
1987-08-16	From Baby Toys to Exercise Gear	LEAD: BACK in 1970, if there were gas stations on all four corners of an intersection in the Far West, chances were all offered Blue Chip Stamps. That was the period when the company hit its peak; it had 90 redemption stores in California, Nevada, Oregon and Arizona.
1987-08-11	Citicorp to Convert Choice Card to Visa	LEAD: After nearly 10 years of marketing its Choice credit card, Citicorp said yesterday it would convert it to Visa.
1987-08-09	CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Up to 60 Percent Off On Children's Clothes Liebman's, a source for children's clothing in the same building in New Rochelle for 60 years, has changed its retail policy and now discounts suggested retail prices by 20 to 40 percent, with reductions to 60 percent on seasonal clearances. The special services of the store remain - parochial school jumpers, skirts, knee socks and blouses for girls and the slacks, blazers, sweaters and shirts for boys; Boy and Girl Scout or camp uniforms, including labeling; plus alterations, a mailing list for sales and layaways.
1987-08-08	Home Loans By Credit Card	LEAD: WHEN Andrew Russell, a Louisville, Ky., attorney, took out a home equity loan last year, he found that he could get access to the money available to him by using a gold Mastercard. And he has since used the credit card to buy a number of items, including a car and equipment for his farm.
1987-08-02	Holograms: Popping Up All Over	LEAD: FOR years, the International Banknote Company, a financial printer in New York, has been grinding out stock and bond certificates, stamps and foreign currency. Now it believes that the technology of holography can make more money for its shareholders than its traditional products, and the company has invested its future in holograms - three-dimensional images created by laser technology.
1987-08-02	STEAKHOUSE LIVES UP TO THE IMAGE	LEAD: P.G.'S on Jericho Turnpike in Huntington is a classic steakhouse. You know the formula: steaks can be ordered for one, two or three people ($19.75, $39.25, $58.75), come sliced from the kitchen and are perched on an overturned saucer so that the juices congregate at one end of the platter.
1987-07-30	Credit-Card Rules Tightened in 12 States	LEAD: Twelve states passed laws this year restricting the advertising practices, fees and interest rates for credit cards, but similar measures died in 24 legislatures, a consumer group said Tuesday.
1987-07-26	WELCOME URBANITY ON NORTH FORK	LEAD: THE restaurant is called Bonnies by the Bay. The bay is the Peconic and the place is the epitome of rural North Fork Long Island: the sleepy little fishing village of New Suffolk. You might expect Bonnies by the Bay to be a quaint dining spot. Not on your life! It's urbane, sophisticated and trendy.
1987-07-24	RESTAURANTS	LEAD: TWENTY-FOUR-YEAR-OLD Nippon is the granddaddy of Manhattan Japanese restaurants, dating from an era when all but the most adventurous Americans would sooner swim to Japan than bite into a chunk of raw fish. Today, of course, sushi has become the fast food of the executive set, and the competition is intense.
1987-07-19	"DINING OUT;
WHERE SMALLNESS PAYS DIVIDENDS"	LEAD: IN THOSE rash and, perhaps fortunately, fleeting moments when we food writers think of opening a restaurant of our own, this is the kind of place we often envision:

Joelian is a Mamaroneck costume-jewelry manufacturer and supplier to catalogue houses and retailers. A three-day sale at the warehouse from Friday through next Sunday is designed to clear discontinued lines, samples and overstock in necklaces, pins, earrings and bracelets, with prices at wholesale or below."
1987-07-12	Limiting Your Liability for a Rental Car	LEAD: SHOULD you buy accident coverage when you rent a car? Until recently, the answer for most people was no: Customers were only expected to pick up the first $500 of damage if they declined to pay the $5 daily fee for insurance coverage. ''It was a ridiculous price,'' to cover so small a risk, said J.
1987-07-05	"DINING OUT;
A Taste of Italy in Old Cape May"	LEAD: BILLED as the nation's oldest seaside resort, Cape May is also distinguished by the number of interesting restaurants it has spawned. From candlelit formality in a restored Victorian manse to lively family dining in a casual seafood bar, the town offers a wide range of dining options.
1987-07-05	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: An Umbrella Is a Thing Of Infinite Variety Zip Jack Custom Umbrella is open five days a week as a showroom and factory outlet in Elmsford, where a portion of 9A south of Route 119 is known as South Central Avenue. The company has 37 years of experience making and marketing umbrellas with domestic woods and fabrics in cafe, patio, beach, golf, children's and doorman styles.
1987-07-03	RESTAURANTS	LEAD: FIRST and Second Avenues in the 70's and 80's, Manhattan's other Little Italy, is abloom with colorful canopies over inviting windows, making it virtually impossible for the casual diner to sort out the exceptional from the forgettable. Violetta, an unassuming two-year-old restaurant, is the kind of place I have strolled by dozens of times without paying particular notice - that is, until some
1987-06-28	A WINNING COMBINATION IN DARIEN	LEAD: GOOD news for families or couples who want to eat out without getting a bank loan: At the Black Goose Grille in Darien, there isn't a dinner entree above $13.95, and most are in the $10.95 range.
1987-06-28	SWISS DIVERSITY IN THE HAMPTONS	LEAD: SWITZERLAND has come to the Hamptons.
1987-06-22	Advertising; Mastercard Picks SSC&B	LEAD: Mastercard International's agency selection committee has picked SSC&B:Lintas to handle its $40 million advertising account.
1987-06-21	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Just About Everything In the Larger Sizes He-Man Shops in Yonkers caters to big (1X to 5X in sport shirts) and tall men (long to XXXT); big jackets from 46 to 66 and in tall sizes 40 to 54 extra long.

1987-06-21	A BOAT RIDE, A VIEW, AND THEN...	LEAD: THE quintessence of summer on Long Island is a cooling ferryboat ride, a view of ospreys on their highly perched nests and a lovely inn offering water views and good meals at the end of the journey. Our destination was the Ram's Head Inn on Shelter Island.
1987-06-14	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Imported Neckware, Wholesale Prices The corporate headquarters and warehouse of I. J. Piccolo are in Croton-on-Hudson about 20 miles north of White Plains.

1987-06-07	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Shoe Bazaar Offers Additional Discounts The Shoe Bazaar - for eight years in Hartsdale Plaza on South Central Park Avenue and for 18 years in Briarcliff Manor at the Chilmark Shopping Plaza - usually sells domestic and imported women's shoes and handbags at 10 to 15 percent off department store prices.
1987-06-03	SAN FRANCISCO HAUTE CUISINE TAKES ROOT	LEAD: WHILE San Francisco is known primarily for its breezy and eclectic grill-style restaurants, a handful of haute cuisine establishments are striving for national recognition. Some have already achieved it, including Campton Place, where all-American cuisine reaches a lofty level with the chef Bradley Ogden, and the seminal Chez Panisse in nearby Berkeley, whose guiding force is Alice
1987-05-31	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Preserving the Best Of a Heritage The National Trust for Historic Preservation was chartered by Congress in 1949 as a nationwide, nonprofit educational organization that ''encourages Americans to participate in preserving the best of their heritage.''

1987-05-29	RESTAURANTS	LEAD: FOR nine years, long before French bistros became the rage in Manhattan, La Gauloise was quietly and competently serving up such homespun fare as mussels mariniere, pepper steak and French fries, roasted rabbit, roast chicken and creme brulee. This handsome and genial spot on the northern rim of Greenwich
1987-05-27	THE SAN FRANCISCO SCENE: A NEW SIMPLICITY IN DINING	LEAD: IN recent months San Franciscans have been haggling over how to fete their illustrious Golden Gate Bridge on its 50th birthday, but now that the celebration is over they can return to their most impassioned topic of conversation: Restaurants.

1987-05-17	TAKE THE GUESTS OUT	LEAD: THE CITY IS HOT, WITHERING HOT, loiter-in-air-conditioned-office-lobbies hot.
1987-05-15	RESTAURANTS	LEAD: THE eight-year-old Gibbon was one of the first restaurants in New York to apply the esthetics of Japanese cuisine to the canvas of French gastronomy. The result was a visually arresting tableau, one that held appeal to those seeking lighter fare that eschewed butter and cream in favor of an Oriental approach based on soy sauce and fresh herbs.
1987-05-03	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"LEAD: 
ALL SORTS OF GIFTS AND FUNCTIONAL DESIGNS Modern Classics, a miniature ''design center,'' opened one month ago in Larchmont with unusual functional designs for table, kitchen, household and bath. The celebration of the opening is Saturday, with music from 1:30 to 3:30 P.M."
1987-05-03	SUGGESTIONS FOR DINING ON MOTHER'S DAY	LEAD: GATHERING the family together while giving mother a day off from the stove is the thoughtful motive that, according to Harper's Index, puts Mother's Day at the top among holidays in the number of Americans who dine out to mark the occasion.
1987-04-26	"DINING OUT;
A WIDE CHOICE OF JAPANESE FARE"	LEAD: AFTER some confusion regarding its name, Shinjuku, Central Avenue's newest dining spot, has finally emerged. Named after a section of Tokyo, this unusual Japanese restaurant offers a variety of cooking and dining styles under one roof.
1987-04-26	"DINING OUT;
BELGIUM OUTPOST ON STATEN ISLAND"	LEAD: LA FOSSE AUX LOUPS is unique in that (a) it specializes in Belgian cuisine, (b) is said to be the best restaurant on Staten Island and (c) the name on the awning out front is Montezuma.
1987-04-26	SPACES AND PLACES	LEAD: New York City long offered real estate developers the opportunity to circumvent certain zoning restrictions if, in exchange, they would provide public amenities on the sites of major developments. Now, after some experience, architects have a much better sense of what attracts people than they did in the 1950's, when Lever House and the Seagram Building were among the only skyscrapers in town with outdoor space dedicated to public use.
1987-04-19	"DINING OUT;
NEW AMERICAN FARE IN TARRYTOWN"	LEAD: THE name of this dining spot says it all.
1987-04-19	ROBERT TOWNSEND HAS FUN AT HOLLYWOOD'S EXPENSE	LEAD: HE COULD HAVE BEEN A PIMP.
1987-04-19	A TOUCH OF SOHO IN SONO	LEAD: SONO, as the renovated area of South Norwalk is called, is developing a SoHo look, reminiscent of the rejuvenated art neighborhood south of Houston Street in Manhattan, and so are its new restaurants.
1987-04-12	"DINING OUT;
SPOT WITH A VIEW IN MAMARONECK"	LEAD: AT last the old James Fenimore Cooper Inn, tacky and rundown for years, has received a face lifting worth noting. The slice of literary history connected with the place is less interesting than its situation on the Sound, just across the road from the bustling Mamaroneck marina and park with its border of cherry trees ready to burst into pink bloom.
1987-04-12	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Up to 80 Percent Off On Some Footwear The Shoe Loft opened a year ago in January above the Colonial Village Flower Shop in the Colonial Village shopping center, where Scarsdale meets New Rochelle. The store discounts by 20 percent the suggested retail prices on Italian-made and other imported women's dress and casual shoes, sandals and boots from a dozen major designers, plus the American-made Mosaic line.
1987-04-12	ITALIAN COMFORT IN NEW HAVEN	LEAD: MRESCA'S RISTORANTE in New Haven is something of a sleeper. It is in a quiet, tree-shaded residential area in the Italian section of town, where one expects to find a typical neighborhood eatery. Not so. Although the premises are storefront-tiny, the space is well-utilized, with four smartly napped tables in the ground-level bar and the main dining area up a few steps.
1987-04-10	RESTAURANT	LEAD: CINCO DE MAYO, or the Fifth of May, is the day in 1862 when Mexico won a famous battle (but ultimately lost the war) against French invaders near the city of Puebla; closer to home, it is the name of a flamboyant SoHo restaurant that in 1983 unleashed the first salvo in the great guacamole invasion of Manhattan.
1987-04-10	FROM CASUAL TO CONTINENTAL CUISINE ALONG THE SPRUCED-UP 46TH STREET	LEAD: THE gangly young ginkgo trees are about to blossom along 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, marking two causes for celebration: The onset of spring and the fruition of a 12-year-old effort to rejuvenate one of the theater district's premier blocks, known as Restaurant Row.
1987-04-05	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: All Sorts of Shapes And Uses in Plastics The Plastic Works! in New Rochelle is celebrating its 17th year is business - in the early years it was called Canal Street Plastics - by offering discounts of 20 percent on cut-to-size plexiglass in several thicknesses and on custom Lucite projects fabricated by the Plastic Works!
1987-04-05	CAJUN AND CREOLE IN EAST SETAUKET	LEAD: THE GREAT ESCAPE in East Setauket bills itself as a nouvelle cuisine restaurant. But the new in this menu comes from New Orleans: New Orleans shrimp remoulade, red beans and rice with andouille sausage, seafood gumbo and rice, New Orleans barbecued shrimp, Commander's Palace redfish Greig, New Orleans chicken Pontalba, Cajun mixed grill and filet mignon
1987-03-29	CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: 3-Day Sale Offers Designer Knits A three-day sale Friday, Saturday and next Sunday in Crugers from noon to 5 P.M. features designer knits by Bonnie Case in natural fibers -cotton and wool - and in rayon alone or rayon blended with metallics.

1987-03-29	Cutting the Cost of Painting the Town	LEAD: AMY AND STUART KURITSKY, two New Jersey lawyers, maintain that two can live the good life as cheaply as one. The couple recently dined at a local Italian restaurant (one free entree: saved $12), then drove to Manhattan, parked at a Kinney lot (50 percent off: saved $6.50) and heard a chamber music concert at the 92d Street Y.M.H.A.
1987-03-29	MENU CHANGES IN OLD GREENWICH	LEAD: THE more things remain the same, the more they change. This variation on the old French observation seems appropriate after recent visits to Cafe du Bec Fin in Old Greenwich.
1987-03-26	Chinese Mastercard	LEAD: The Bank of China plans to merge its Great Wall credit card operations with Mastercard International, the official New China News Agency said today.
1987-03-22	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Remarkable Re-marks Of Lerner Prices Mary Lerner, a corset shop owned by one family for 37 years in White Plains and with branches on Long Island, is closing on Mamaroneck Avenue by March 28 rather than pay doubled rent, according to Irving Lerner, the owner.
1987-03-22	"DINING OUT;
NEAR THE 'SMALL HOTEL' IN STOCKTON"	LEAD: STOCKTON is known for Colligan's Inn, made famous by Rodgers and Hart as the subject of their 1936 song ''There's a Small Hotel.'' The Hunterdon County town was just as well known among food people for a small restaurant down the road called Le Bistro. The quality of food there alternated almost from year to year between very good and average.
1987-03-16	VISA ASKS BANK MOVE ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD	LEAD: Visa U.S. Inc., responding swiftly to the American Express Company's announcement last week that it would introduce a revolving credit card, has asked its issuing banks to reconsider their sale of American Express traveler's checks and other products.
1987-03-15	"DINING OUT;
AN OASIS OF CHARM IN TRENTON"	LEAD: NO, George Washington did not sleep there, but, according to The Eagle Tavern's modest claim, he did at least pass by. Built in 1765, the handsome, galleried brick structure is one of the few pre-Revolutionary buildings still standing in the state capital. Rescued by the city from the brink of demolition and then restored by the Trenton Historical Society, it now stands as an oasis of Colonial charm in a nondescript downtown block.
1987-03-15	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Fabrics in Pleasantville In the Old Village Old Village Fabrics is at the junction of Routes 141 and 117 and, as the name indicates, is in the historic-village area in Pleasantville. The shop has a St. Patrick's Day special linked solely to the date of celebration Tuesday: a 17-percent reduction in the price of any fabric containing the color green.
1987-03-15	VIETNAMESE CUISINE IN GREENWICH	LEAD: ON entering the white-walled, high-ceilinged upstairs dining room of La Maison Indochine in Greenwich, one has the illusion of stepping into a cool oasis from the steamy heat of Vietnam. Mother-of-pearl inlaid wood screens and Indochinese paintings continue the Southeast Asian motif.
1987-03-11	13.5% AMERICAN EXPRESS RATE	LEAD: In a move that banking experts said could cause upheaval in the credit card business, the American Express Company said yesterday that it would offer its first card that would routinely allow customers to pay their bills in installments.
1987-03-08	"DINING OUT;
A DEARTH OF SEAFOOD RESTAURANTS"	LEAD: THERE'S a certain uneveness in New Jersey when it comes to the type of restaurants available in most areas. For instance, no one would deny that there's a surfeit of Italian restaurants. There are also plenty of Chinese and Continental restaurants and steak houses, if those chains are included. Even
1987-03-08	A TASTE OF THAILAND IN DANBURY	LEAD: RUN, don't walk, to Bangkok, the new and only Thai restaurant in Connecticut.
1987-03-08	CONTRASTS IN MENU AND IN LOOKS	LEAD: MARBLES in Locust Valley is a restaurant of contrasts. A huge 80-year-old bar with carved oak and mirrored backing, embellished by marble columns and marble railing, dominates the room. Ceiling fans, bentwood chairs, brass railings and wall sconces echo the turn-of-the-century feeling. One's eye then darts to the bright pink walls, the posters of modern art and a pink neon sign on the back wall spelling out
1987-03-06	RESTAURANTS	LEAD: THE grimy and cheerless arcade running just off the Bowery north of Elizabeth Street has seen better days. Those who venture within, however, will find a compact and cacophonous little restaurant, the 16-year-old Phoenix Garden, that runs perpetually on overdrive, spinning out some splendid Cantonese dishes.
1987-03-01	CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: Shoes and More Shoes In 250 Styles The Factory Outlet Store of Church's English Shoes in Goodwives Plaza in Darien, Conn., just celebrated the company's 114th anniversary and features various promotions monthly. Besides the older London and Paris branches, in the United States the locations are in Manhattan, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, Seattle and four in California.
1987-02-15	ITALIAN WITH AN OPERATIC SETTING	LEAD: IF you were naming a restaurant, you might have qualms about calling it Rigoletto's, after the ill-starred and vindictive jester of the tragic Verdi opera. Perhaps the proprietor of Rigoletto's, a new Italian eatery in New Canaan, recalls the opera differently, for the menu states that ''the character of Rigoletto .
1987-02-15	IT'S ALMOST LIKE A VISIT TO ITALY	LEAD: WHEN you walk through the door of Tre Amici in Babylon, you forget you're on Long Island. The brass railings, fresh flowers on the bar, the antique breakfront and the espresso machine all say Italy.
1987-02-13	RESTAURANTS	LEAD: YOU enter the dining room at Chez Louis and pass a long serving station where waiters hack away at sizzling roast chickens and divvy up portions of hulking prime ribs and wildly aromatic suckling pig. A perusal of the premises, where tables fairly sag under the weight of he-man portions, reveals that this year-and-a-half-old restaurant is for serious no-holds-barred eaters.
1987-02-08	JAPANESE WITH CHARM AND VALUE	LEAD: THE few Japanese restaurants to open in recent years in Connecticut have been of relatively high quality. One of the oldest, Hatsune in New Haven, is not only going strong, but has also, for the most part, sustained the high level of achievement reached in its early days.
1987-02-01	TWYLA THARP, MAVERICK, TAKES A NEW GAMBLE	LEAD: Her wispy black hair still damp from a three-hour morning workout in the next-door studio, Twyla Tharp is putting the dancers of her newly revamped company through their paces in ''As Time Goes By.'' The Tharp work, created originally for the Joffrey Ballet in 1975 to music by Haydn, is proving troublesome for the dancers, who must perform a chain of knotty steps while moving in a tight cluster at breakneck speed.
1987-02-01	TINY CAFE HINTS OF NANTUCKET	LEAD: KUDOS to the new Nantucket Cafe in New Canaan for its imaginative use of interior space. In a room that holds just nine tables and seats 22 people, the ambiance of Nantucket has been artfully evoked.
1987-01-30	FROM NUTS TO SOUP, FOR CHINESE NEW YEAR	LEAD: THE usual animated pace of Chinatown intensifies to a dizzying pace this weekend as the new year is welcomed with spirited toasts and staggering feasts. Some Chinatown restaurants offer special prix-fixe banquets during the holidays; others feature traditional dishes ripe with symbolism: chicken brings good fortune, egg rolls portend the arrival of spring, egg dumplings signify golden ingots, round meatballs connote family togetherness.
1987-01-25	COZY FRENCH FOR HEARTY APPETITES	LEAD: AT least three restaurants are clustered along Torrington's Main Street, making it a small-scale Restaurant Row. Newest is Le Rochambeau, whose name telegraphs the French menu you find within.
1987-01-18	CAREFULL SHOPPER	LEAD: 20 Percent Discount Just the Beginning A Woman's Place opened in September in Kisco Plaza East in Mount Kisco - that is on East Main Street between Loehmann's and Benetton -and specializes in sizes 14 to 52, always at discounts of 10 to 20 percent off suggested retail prices. The semiannual clearance sale this month reduces prices an additional 30 to 50 percent on fall and winter merchandise.
1987-01-11	"DINING OUT;
NOT JUST ANOTHER CALIFORNIA FACE"	LEAD: AT first glance, Seasons' menu looks like just another California clone - fresh this, fresh that, guacamole with everything.
1987-01-11	CAREFUL SHOPPER	LEAD: 30 to 50 Percent Off On Shoes and Boots D. Marshe Shoe Gallery in the Scarsdale Park Mall opened in November and has reduced fall and winter shoe and boot prices by 30 to 50 percent off suggested retail prices this month. Sizes are 5 1/2 to 10, with some styles in size 5. The store also has evening shoes, costume jewelry, scarves, hair and shoe ornaments from France and Italy, hosiery by Berkshire.
1987-01-09	RESTAURANTS	LEAD: KITCHO is not a name that is bandied about often when gastronomic commandos huddle to swap intelligence reports on hot spots in the field. This 20-year-old midtown Japanese restaurant is about as chic as a Honda Civic, notable more for its longevity than its luster. Its formula for graceful aging is unglamorous and straightforward: a warm and efficient staff combined with dependably fresh and attractive Japanese food.
1987-01-07	BISON RETURNS TO THE RANGE AND THE TABLE	LEAD: WHEN George Washington Nyhart arrived in Montana's Madison Valley in the 1860's, vast herds of bison roamed the plains, providing him and other settlers with an ample supply of fresh meat. Today, bison -or buffalo, as they are commonly, if incorrectly, called - supply George Nyhart's great-great-grandson Jerry, his wife,
1987-01-05	Citicorp, Dai-Ichi Seen Close to Alliance	LEAD: While the report of an agreement between Citicorp and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Ltd. remained unconfirmed over the weekend, the heads of consumer banking for the big international banks in New York - and some top Japanese bankers based here - said they had been hearing that the two banks were close to forming a strategic alliance.
1987-01-01	FIRST CHICAGO TO BUY DELAWARE BANK	LEAD: Increasing its stake in the credit-card business, the First Chicago Corporation said today that it would buy the Beneficial National Bank in Wilmington, Del., from the Beneficial Corporation for $247 million.
1986-12-29	THE CREDIT-CARD FRAUD BATTLE	Despite widespread efforts by merchants and financial institutions to combat it, credit-card fraud is still a huge, worldwide problem, and a problem that gets worse at Christmas, when stores are jammed and credit card use peaks. ''It's the biggest volume period for us, and the fraud goes up correspondingly,'' said William D. Neumann, a former F.B.I. agent who is now chief of security at Visa. ''The sales clerks are often part-timers, and frauds figure that if they are going to cheat, Christmas is the time to do it.'' Although heightened law enforcement has actually led to a decline in losses from card fraud in percentage terms, to around 15 hundredths of 1 percent of credit-card sales, worldwide fraud losses this year at Mastercard International Inc. and Visa U.S.A. Inc. will still exceed $200 million, experts say. That is up from roughly $125 million in 1982. Fraud losses from counterfeit Visa and Mastercard cards alone, which law-enforcement officials thought they could eliminate through such anti-counterfeiting tools as holograms, will exceed $30 million.
1986-12-21	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Four Retailers In Village Yard The Village Yard in Chappaqua is an enclave of four retailers offering a considerable variety - plus free parking. All are open from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Monday through Saturday, and today from noon to 5 P.M., but not other Sundays. Gift certificates are available and wrapping is free on nonsale items. Chappaqua is an exit off the Saw Mill River Parkway, northbound. Turn left at the end of the ramp, left again at the light, and left again on the other side of the bridge, then right up King Street and the Village Yard is to the right.

Overs & Unders and Signatures are on the upper level, featuring imported and domestically made lingerie in one section and in the entrance area custom-printed invitations, announcements, paper goods and stationery for business and personal use.

The silk teddies made in this country sell for $70; the silk chemises from France cost $65 and tap pants and camisole sets are $75. All-cotton, bead-decorated nightgowns cost $80 and Queen Anne's Lace designs by Eileen West include Victorian-look sleepwear in cotton flannel - gowns and robes are about $70."
1986-12-19	Chase Lowers All Card Rates	The Chase Manhattan Bank, the country's third-largest issuer of credit cards, said yesterday that it would reduce the annual percentage rate on all of its cards by as much as 3.3 points. Several smaller financial institutions have reduced credit card rates and fees in the last six months, but Chase is the largest issuer to announce across-the-board reductions.
1986-12-14	"DINING OUT;
SOMERS RESTAURANT RETURN"	"NO doubt more than a few up-county diners have mourned the mysterious closing of A Country Place last January.

Reopened in June, however, under new ownership and with a new kitchen staff, A Country Place seems again to be doing its best to please its patrons. Having followed the restaurant's progress over the last four months, we are happy to report that both decor and food not only have improved since its shaky opening but appear to be getting better with every visit. Although the restaurant has not yet achieved two-star status, it's heading in that direction. In the meantime, A Country Place is certainly worth knowing about even now."
1986-12-14	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Offerings to Meet Holidays' Needs Ellie Conason has gathered unusual gifts and crafts for holiday sale at the Hudson River Museum's Red Grooms Bookstore, the Craft Gallery and the Holiday Shop Annex.

William Morris, the textile designer, is represented by Caspari's Art Nouveau reproductions on tote bags ($16.50, whether black paisley or the more subdued old-fashioned design), three-ply cocktail napkins ($1.75 for 20), diaries and guest books ($17.50 to $28) and some picture frames. Other porcelain picture frames are $20 to $30.

The jewelry includes three-strand freshwater pearls, jade, coral, carnelian, amethyst and garnet, and the designer jewelry in sterling and other metals is by Ronald Hayes Pearson, Glenda Arentzen, Irena Brynner, Kate Pearce, Anne Dick and Ruth Berridge.

The clay menorahs that Mrs. Conason describes as ''with a windswept, desert look,'' cost $40 and $50, and the wreaths from Honduras have handmade angels and little terra cotta flowers set on entwined twigs with a grapevine look and sell for $22.50. Leaded-glass decorative cocktail table boxes by Martin Kremer combine nautilus slices, or a slice of a striated amethyst or other mineral, and some have mirrored bases inside to reflect the lids and sides, all for $42 to $75."
1986-12-14	A SPOT FOR A LEISURELY BRUNCH	HUCKLEBERRY'S, near the railroad station in New Canaan, had its beginnings as the dining adjunct to an indoor tennis club. New ownership, a new name and various decorating changes subsequently ensued. Renovation several years ago created a lighter, more spacious looking dining area. This is especially evident in the airy, garden-like adjunct to the main dining room. Recent visits indicate that while the menu is eclectic, with a nod to the Orient and heavy obeisance to the Cajun trend, the kitchen skills have noticeably improved. No longer open for lunch, Huckleberry's is an unusually good bet for a leisurely Sunday brunch. The $12.95 buffet that includes a free cocktail is generous and varied enough to constitute dinner. And the overall quality of offerings is high, from the meaty, nongreasy bacon and pork sausages to the excellent smoked tuna, rare roast beef, roast lamb and turkey and flavorful baked ham, all with appropriate sauces.
1986-12-13	PROCESSING FOR CHARGIT RESUMES	One day after Chargit Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, anxious merchants who had used Chargit to handle their credit-card receipts began to collect some of the money owed them as the Bowery Savings Bank, under a court agreement, resumed processing yesterday for the troubled company. Bowery officials, who said the bank was considering legal action against the company, said they were temporarily processing Chargit business to help the merchants who had depended on its service. Response to Bowery Charges In response to the charges made Thursday by the Bowery that the company had used money routed from the credit-card companies to the merchants for ''other purposes,'' Gerald Walpin of Rosenman Colin Freund Lewis & Cohen, an attorney for Chargit executives, said his clients were ''confident the company operated under proper procedures.''
1986-12-12	CHARGIT REPORTED IN CHAPTER 11	Chargit Inc., one of the nation's biggest telephone ticket reservation companies, was reported yesterday to have filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The filing was disclosed by the Bowery Savings Bank, which announced earlier this week that it had severed its ties with Chargit and with one of Chargit's units that processed Mastercard and Visa charge slips for 3,000 businesses in the New York area. That unit was shut down on Wednesday, leaving many of the businesses with serious cash-flow problems at the height of the holiday shopping season. Processing to Resume In a statement last night, Bowery said it had agreed to permit Chargit to resume processing the charge-card transactions until the end of January ''to prevent disruption to merchants' business.'' The bank acts as a conduit for Chargit, funneling payments from Visa and Mastercard through the company to the merchants.
1986-12-11	Chargit Credit Service	Chargit, a telephone ticket reservation company, said yesterday that it is trying to restore immediately, at least on an interim basis, credit-card processing services. The services were halted after the Bowery Savings Bank announced earlier this week that it would end an arrangement under which Chargit processed Visa and Mastercard credit-card transactions for the Bowery.
1986-12-07	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"World's Four Corners Offer Food Treats Foods of All Nations is just south of Lord & Taylor on White Plains Post Road in Eastchester, with a Scarsdale mailing address. The shelves hold the elements of survival packages for college crammers and corporate gifts and thoughtful morsels for specialized palates of all ages. Health considerations can be accommodated with salt-free mustard or crackers, sugarless preserves, decaffeinated teas, fresh-ground coffee or beans and Cafix, a natural cereal beverage.

The mail-order catalogue is free and samples of items, called Veronika Gifts, are on hand. But custom-filled orders might be more fun to assemble. Many types of reusable baskets and other containers are available and gift wrapping and shipping can be arranged.

Shoppers will find a cafe, open from 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M., with homemade seafood and high-protein salads, croissants plain and fancy, five-grain bread, quiches, cheeses, pates, hot pastrami, spinach in phyllo dough, Tofutti ice cream and baked specialties. Advent calendars are $1.79 each, with a piece of chocolate for each day, and Godiva and other chocolates are carried."
1986-12-07	Italian Fare in a Historic Setting	FOR a number of years the historic Willet Titus House in Roslyn has been occupied by restaurants. The latest, Il Pavone, has done a felicitously low-key job of decorating, with walls in soft pink, gauzy curtains at the window and formal, traditional appointments. It is a feminine setting, suggestive of the Victorian era and far more effective a scheme than in the past. The welcome is gracious and the service is careful if somewhat inexperienced, but the food, from a fairly standard Italian menu, is at best respectable. It needs improvement to match the setting.
1986-12-07	INTRIGUING CHINESE IN WESTPORT	NOT in name, decor or menu is Panda Pavilion a clone of any of the Sichuan-Hunan-Beijing-Cantonese restaurants that have multiplied in Fairfield County in the last 10 years. Westport's newest Chinese restaurant is very much itself, with paintings of playful pandas setting the stage for meals that offer quite a few surprises. What is not a surprise, at least to Westport residents who remember two previous restaurant tenants, Beethoven's and Serendipity, is the Post Road location. Even so, the familiar interior configuration has been subtly modified and ornamented with calligraphy, a landscape on the wall of one cozy dining alcove and a scene that might be an illustration from the Chinese novel ''Dream of the Red Chamber'' on another.
1986-11-30	PICK A CARD, ANY CARD, EVERY CARD	CREDIT card executives are rubbing their hands with glee now that the Christmas season has begun. Americans have always been big spenders at this time of year and more and more of that spending is being done via credit cards. Visa alone expects 200 million purchases to be made on its card between Thanksgiving and Christmas - about 5,340 a minute, totaling $10 billion in charges and huge fees for Visa's member banks. ''Christmas is our final exam,'' said Charles T. Russell, president of Visa International. But that exam may soon get harder and harder to pass. The immense profitability of the credit card business is attracting new and stiffer competition, at a time when the 105.5 million Americans who have credit cards already have an average of 6.9 cards apiece, and the creditworthy adults who do not have them show few signs of wanting them.
1986-11-29	HOW TO STAY OUT ON BAIL WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF CASH? CHARGE IT!	A year ago, around Thanksgiving, an elderly couple went to the Morris County jail to try to make bail for their grandson, who was being held on a shoplifting charge. ''They were renters, so they had no property for a property bond,'' the County Clerk, Joseph J. Bell, recalled. ''The banks were closed, they didn't have an automatic cash card, and they were arguing among themselves over what item of jewelry they would have to pawn to secure their grandson's release. They were afraid he would have to spend several days in there.''
1986-11-29	BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1986  	Companies Chesebrough-Pond's has attracted other potential suitors, Wall Street sources said. Chesebrough's top executives are all but resigned to an acquisition and their goal is to obtain the best price, according to the sources. On Tuesday, American Brands offered to buy Chesebrough for $66 a share, or $2.8 billion. Takeover experts say that Chesebrough must either accept the American Brands bid or come up with a better alternative, such as arranging a friendly takeover or undergoing a restructuring. [ Page 37. ] Petro-Lewis is weighing a bankruptcy filing because it is in default on some debt payments. It was unclear how a Chapter 11 filing would affect the energy concern's agreement to be acquired by Freeport-McMoran. [ 37. ]
1986-11-29	Credit Cards: No 'Free Ride'	FOR years, consumers have taken a free ride on their credit cards, buying one day and not having to pay until 20 to 30 days after receipt of their monthly card statements. Now, many cardholders are finding the free ride is over or not nearly so long as before. Within the last year, a trend has gained momentum among banks and other issuers of Visa and Mastercard to eliminate the 20-to-30-day grace period. At these banks, interest typically begins on the date that the bank receives the charge slip from a participating establishment. As a result, convenience users, as well as users who pay part of their bill on a revolving credit basis, wind up paying interest.
1986-11-23	THE 'NUTCRACKER' CASTS ITS SPELL ONCE MORE	"IN LATE October, when audition notices for ''The Nutcracker'' are posted, the atmosphere in ballet studios takes on a frenzied and delerious quality.

Not until New Year's, when the last Soldier's hat is wrapped in tissue and the Sugarplum Fairy's tutu is carefully packed away, does life become normal again for the children who perform in the annual extravaganza.

The first spell was cast more than 30 years ago, when the late George Balanchine staged ''The Nutcracker'' for the New York City Ballet. His recreation of the original Petipa-Ivanov ballet, in which Balanchine himself appeared at Leningrad's Maryinsky Theater, forms the basis for most versions offered today.

The scintillating Tchaikovsky score, the lace and velvet of the children in Act I, the divertissements of the professional dancers in Act II - this is enchantment on a grand scale. And for the children, the experience is unparalleled."
1986-11-23	MANY CUISINES IN A TINY SPACE	AFTER dining at M'Norah in Massapequa Park, one wonders how it is able to fit so many cuisines into such a tiny space. The storefront restaurant, done in pale pink with delicate flower and vegetable motifs stenciled on walls as borders, barely seats 30, but it offers a menu of Thai and French specialities, with some Italian, Japanese and American thrown in for good measure. The chef, who is Thai but likes to cook French food, is talented enough to make it all work surprisingly well. The name of the restaurant is that of a guardian angel in Thai mythology, who is evidently doing a good job because the restaurant is generally filled night after night. It is necessary to allow several weeks' time to obtain reservations for peak dining hours on weekends.
1986-11-22	CITICORP CUTS CREDIT CARD RATE	In what appears to be a breakthrough in credit-card interest rates, Citicorp will cut the rates on some credit cards to 16.8 percent from 19.8 percent. However, it will increase the annual fee on those cards to $50 from $40. The change, effective Jan. 1, applies to Citicorp's 1.5 million ''preferred'' Mastercard and Visa accounts, which generally carry higher credit lines than regular Mastercard and Visa cards.
1986-11-21	RESTAURANTS	SIX-YEAR-OLD Pesca has always been puzzling to me. It has so much going for it: a coolly elegant cafe atmosphere wrapped in shades of salmon-pink; handsome nautical artwork; a comely clientele and a well-conceived all-seafood menu. Food quality, though, bobs and weaves like a marlin on a long trawl line. The kitchen produces more than a few superior dishes, such as seafood risottos, gumbos, lobster and cioppino. However, when it comes to the touchstone of all good fish houses - unembellished fresh fish expertly broiled or sauteed, which most seafood fans crave - it can be a letdown. The lunch scene at Pesca (23 East 22d Street) is animated and loud. Service can be exasperatingly slow at peak times. Unassailably fresh and well-iced Wellfleet oysters make a bright starter, as does the light and nicely seasoned seafood chowder holding chunks of salmon, celery and carrots. Gravlax, the cured salmon seasoned with dill, looks enticing but is underseasoned.
1986-11-16	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Food Bazaar, Plus 27 Vendors Estherwood's Elegant Boutiques, the seventh yearly preholiday shopping spree at the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, is Wednesday from 10 A.M. to 5 P. M.; Thursday 10 A.M. to 9 P. M. and Friday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., including luncheon daily from noon to 2 at $7 each.

Lunch reservations should be made on arrival and a paging system summons shoppers for each table at the appropriate time. Parking on the grounds is free, but difficult, and car-pooling is suggested to ease that situation. The $3 entrance fee covers all three days."
1986-11-16	AN ITALIAN FIXTURE IN EAST HILLS	LA PRIMAVERA in East Hills, at one time a highlight of the Long Island restaurant scene, has not aged gracefully. Although the reasonable prices obviously make dining here attractive for those who reserve many days in advance, the cooking is no longer distinctive. The place needs a new outlook in the kitchen and a new look in the dining room. In other words, it needs a facelift.
1986-11-14	At Restaurants, From Neapolitan Dishes to Middle Eastern Delicacies	Manhattanites are generally wary of seeking out restaurants in the mysterious boroughs, or at least those establishments they can't see from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. That's just fine to the two-million-plus residents of Brooklyn - makes it easier to get a table. From the Middle Eastern enclaves of Atlantic Avenue to the Sicilian sections of Bensonhurst, dining spots of all stripes abound. What some may lack in drama and glitter they make up for in warmth and charm - not to mention remarkably reasonable prices by ''city'' standards. Here are the results of a hungry diner's trek around one of New York's most animated and aromatic areas. (All establishments listed take reservations.) Crisci's (593 Lorimer Street, 718-384-9204): Ensconced in a residential neighborhood in the Williamsburg-Greenpoint section of Brooklyn is Crisci's - ''A Tradition Since 1902.'' Not much has changed since opening day in this expansive, garlic-scented dining room patronized by a regular crowd of serious eaters. The food is old-fashioned and copious, with marinara red being the predominant color. Eggplant caponata is a sparkling starter, and spaghetti with clam sauce is generous and tasty - bolstered with enough garlic to keep vampires three states away. Lunch and dinner noon to 11 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday; closed Monday. Appetizers $4 to $8.95; main courses $8.50 to $14. No credit cards.
1986-11-12	FOOD NOTES	Citymeals Fund-Raisers For the fourth year in a row, Citymeals-on-Wheels has turned to restaurants to participate in fund raising - 3,500 of them, throughout the five boroughs. During Restaurant Week, which starts Nov. 17, the owners of all these restaurants will be asking customers to join them in helping feed the homebound elderly. Along with the check, diners will receive envelopes for their Citymeals-on-Wheels contributions, which can be made in cash, by check or charged to American Express. This month, American Express will also donate 3 cents to Citymeals-on-Wheels every time the credit card is used in a New York City restaurant.
1986-11-09	NEW DECOR AND NEW DIMENSIONS	THE Great Dane in Huntington has changed hands. Although no hint of Viking presence remains on the menu, economics requires the new owners, both of whom have been working in the kitchen at Restaurant Zanghi in Glen Cove, to retain the name printed on the awning. But the various elements of Scandinavian decoration in the simple storefront setting are gradually being replaced. Gone are the floor-to-ceiling canvas tarpaulins adorned with Scandinavian flags that had hidden coat racks.
1986-11-09	Mastering the Wilderness	The Wilderness Society is the latest nonprofit organization to lend its name and mailing list to the marketing of bank credit cards in return for a ''royalty'' from the is-suing bank. The Washington-based society has sent its 160,000 conservationist members, on its letterhead, an offer under which they can receive a gold MasterCard from Maryland Bank of Delaware, with the society's name and logo on the it.
1986-11-02	WHITE, PINK AND NOTHING BUT PASTA	PASTA PRESTO in Great Neck, the third restaurant serving only pasta main courses to open on Long Island in recent years, is the suburban branch of a place of the same name in Manhattan. Like other pasta restaurants, this one offers relatively inexpensive dining in a pleasant, contemporary setting. The restaurant is large and bright, done mostly in white with accents of pink and red. Seating is divided between an area near the entrance, which can have a crowded feeling when people are standing and waiting for tables (Pasta Presto takes reservations only for parties of six or more), and another porchlike area up a few steps.
1986-10-31	Stellar Cast For Wining and Dining	ONE of the longest-running dramas on Broadway - one suffused with suspense, mystery, discovery and occasional flashes of humor - might be called the Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Theatrical Universe. Theatergoers looking for appealing restaurants before or after a show this season have a diverse cast from which to choose. New members of the lineup range from the buoyant French bistro Chez Josephine on West 42d Street to such full-blown productions as Palio and Le Bernardin on West 51st. It is always wise to reserve a table well in advance, especially at the more popular spots, to avert a desperate last-minute scramble; also, allow at least one and a half hours for leisurely dining unless you are adept at jogging through crowded streets while chomping on a strawberry tart. Some establishments offer special pre- or post-theater menus that can be significant bargains, so ask when you call. Here is a selective roundup of restaurants in the theater district, starting with the more expensive establishments. Unless otherwise noted, all accept reservations.
1986-10-26	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Clothing and Things At Scarsdale Fair For 40 years the Women's Guild of the Scarsdale Congregational Church had scheduled its fair on Election Day. This year it is earlier - Saturday from 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. The location is the same, Dyckman Hall near the church, and the fair will feature the traditional lunch with Rachel Mead's corn chowder, a favorite for 25 years. It will also introduce examples of Don Herner's culinary skill -25 homemade apple pies.

A presale for almost-new clothing will be at the same hours Friday on the lower level of the church as well as Saturday, and light refreshments will be available both days. Some women's clothing is new: the Hanson Originals with labels in. There are slightly used blouses, jackets and skirts; other contributions are evening and day dresses, sweaters, shoes, hats, handbags and coats. There is children's and teen-age apparel, jeans and outerwear and men's shoes, coats, shirts and sport jackets."
1986-10-26	CALIFORNIA CHIC IN EAST NORWICH	CANCEL that trip to Los Angeles and travel instead to the Black Walnut in East Norwich, the most authentic example of California-style dining on Long Island. Even the elegant new shopping complex in which the restaurant is situated has a look more Beverly Hills than East Hills or Dix Hills. The restaurant itself is a stunner. The walls and the soaring ceiling are done in the palest desert apricot trimmed in sea-foam green, bleached wood and terra cotta tiles. A handsome open kitchen -where West really meets East - is the focus of the main room and can also be glimpsed from the second area off to the side. Tables are simply, elegantly set. The only jarring note is the overly loud music; high-decibel Strauss waltzes are not relaxing, especially in a restaurant without a dance floor. Glenn Miller was better, but still could be toned down.
1986-10-22	"AROUND THE REGION, FINE RESTAURANTS FOR FALL TOURING;
New Jersey"	"THE following restaurants are new, and from Manhattan, they can be reached within an hour or two. Each is in a scenic area with the added attraction of antiques shops nearby.
Frenchtown Inn

A TREK down pastoral Hunterdon County lanes on New Jersey's western fringe to view the foliage and, perhaps, stroll along the towpaths lining the Delaware River can be combined with a meal at the Frenchtown Inn, a 19th-century brick building at the foot of the Frenchtown Bridge. The chef-owner, Robert Long - who trained at Le Francais in Wheeling, Ill., and with Georges Blanc at his restaurant in Vonnas, France - offers simple, elegant French dishes."
1986-10-22	Connecticut	TO New Yorkers, Connecticut is made for getaways -close, often secluded and relaxed enough to make an afternoon or evening away from the city easy and worthwhile. There are dozens of delightful havens here, but this trio of restaurants is especially agreeable: good food, appealing ambiance and scenic locations. The Inn at Chester SOUTH of Hartford, near the Connecticut River, is the handcraft- and antiques-rich village of Chester. Just outside, in beautiful woods bordering the Cockaponset State Forest is The Inn at Chester, where the dining room is in the John B. Parmelee House, a 1776 clapboard farmhouse. The high-ceilinged dining room, with a large walk-in fireplace and a greenhouse area looking out on pond, features a seasonal menu. The dishes, prepared in the light New American style, with a nod toward New England specialties, include a mushroom strudel and Cornish game hen stuffed with a homemade ground sausage and spinach dressing.
1986-10-19	THREE FAVORITES STAND UP WELL	LETTERS to this column criticizing restaurants generally focus on one major complaint - disappointing service. Anyone who dines out recognizes how important flawless service is to the enjoyment of a meal. Superb food can be overshadowed by slipshod or rude service. Conversely, average food is often salvaged by superior service, turning an ordinary meal into a memorable dining experience. This was brought home to us recently when we revisited three of restaurants that had been awarded three stars by this column. Although the visits were not in the depth that a full-fledged review requires, we were pleased that in all three cases, the restaurants were continuing the same high-quality food, presentation, ambiance and service that had earned them the original high praise. In each case, the three stars seem firmly justified.
1986-10-12	"DINING OUT;
STOREFRONT SURPRISE IN CHATHAM"	"THE simple hand-lettered sign with the name Fresh Fields Cafe surrounded by naively painted vegetables would lead one to think that the little storefront might be a health-food luncheonette.

What a pleasant surprise to find, upon entering, a dining room filled with fresh flowers, cheerful paintings and tables covered in white linen. And in the back, working out of a pocket-sized kitchen in view of the diners, the owner, Kevin Collins, can be seen turning out an imaginative array of artfully presented dishes.

How the young chef came to be here is an amusing story. It seems that, with experience at the two-star St. Charlie's Restaurant in Oakland, and, before that, at l'Auberge de France in Wayne, Mr. Collins began seeking new pastures: a restaurant of his own."
1986-10-12	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"A Variety of Balloons And Holiday Items Westchester Balloon and Carnival Supply in White Plains has a variety of balloons these days as well as discounted Halloween and other seasonal wares. It offers bulk discounts and will accommodate tax-exempt organizations producing certification on the prescribed forms.

Early Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year's shoppers will find a 50 percent discount on ticketed prices, and paper and plastic goods for engagement or baby showers, anniversaries or birthdays have 20 to 40 percent markdowns.

Halloween items are 10 percent off marked prices: costumes, beards and wigs; eye and full-face or head masks of glitter, feathers and rubber; pig's noses or ears; halos for angels or brooms for witches and hats for villains, clowns or Punch. Wriggly black spiders and their webs, ants, houseflies in daunting sizes and inflatable snakes are among the collection."
1986-10-12	DEBT COUNSELING MUSHROOMS	"THE number of Connecticut residents looking for help in getting out of serious debt has almost tripled in the last three years, says Beverly E. Tuttle, executive director of the Consumer Credit Counseling office in the state.

The Credit Counseling Bureau in Hartford and its branches in New Haven and Groton saw 1,027 clients last year - up from 560 in 1984. Mrs. Tuttle said she and her staff expect to see about 1,500 people this year.

''All of the consumer credit counseling services are seeing more clients than ever before,'' said Mrs. Tuttle, whose office is one of 260 around the country.

Nationally, 25 percent more clients sought credit counseling this year - or about 75,000, up from 60,000 in 1985, said Donald L. Badders, president of the National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Silver Spring, Md.

Also, he added, consumer bankruptcies nationwide are up 42 percent, to about 600,000 from 411,000 last year,and the consumer debt stands at about $600 billion, up 20 percent over last year."
1986-10-12	NO. 5 IS NO. 1 FOR CHINESE CUISINE	HOMERS ORIENTAL, No. 5 in the series of restaurants owned by the peripatetic Homer Lee, recently made its debut in Syosset. Not only is it the best of the Homers, but also it is one of the most innovative Chinese restaurants to have opened on Long Island. It is called Homers Oriental because the cooking ventures beyond China, with a number of Japanese specialities such as teriyaki and tempura plus some dishes such as beef with basil that are Thai. There is another Homers Oriental in Cedarhurst that gives more representation to Japanese food, including sushi, but that restaurant is not in the same culinary league as this latest Homers.
1986-10-08	KOSHER DINING OUT: THE OPTIONS GROW	UNTIL recently, dining options for Jews in New York City who keep kosher were largely limited to delicatessens and dairy restaurants that featured a predictable roster of foods and a clamorous eat-it's-good-for-you atmosphere. This left many observant Jews wistful observers of the restaurant explosion in the city over the past few years, especially younger people and singles who read about the buoyant social scenes and enticing foods at these places, yet were proscribed from frequenting them. Suddenly, that is changing. Within the past 18 months nearly a dozen kosher restaurants have opened that offer much in the way of ambiance and culinary diversity, particularly during this holiday time. Some are new establishments, others older ones that have changed to kosher menus. Among them are La Kasbah, Benjamin of Tudela and Levana on the Upper West Side, Cheers in midtown, Little Budapest in Brooklyn and five outlets of the Manhattan cafe chain called the Great American Health Bar. Judging from recent visits to these new kosher eating spots, the response has been enthusiastic.
1986-10-05	INCREASED BUS FLEET SET BY NJ TRANSIT	"A CONTRACT to start NJ Transit's $114 million bus- purchase program will be signed by mid-October, according to agency officials.

NJ Transit's board of directors recently approved the purchase of up to 415 new commuter buses and some 500 refurbished vehicles. If the contract is signed within a few weeks, the first of the new long-distance commuter buses should be rolling by next summer.

Under the multimillion-dollar capital improvement plan, the age of NJ Transit's bus fleet will be dramatically reduced. And, officials say, some 130 private bus companies will also reap the benefits of the program when they receive new and reconditioned buses from the state at no charge."
1986-10-05	FINE FARE AMONG THE ART	FOOD is often considered an art form, and at Au Musee you can enjoy the blending of food and art in a single place. This French-accented restaurant can be found in the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, one of Connecticut's premiere art museums. Several years ago, a restaurant that began at the Atheneum moved to a separate location in Avon. Au Musee represents a reversal of this process. It is the creation of the owners of an already very successful establishment in Chester, Restaurant du Village.
1986-10-05	CAPTURING THE LUSTINESS OF NAPLES	SEATS at La Parma, in Williston Park, are as hard to come by as tickets to a Mets game. The simple, bright, noisy, crowded dining room with its greenhouse extension takes no reservations and there is frequently a long wait for tables. But La Parma hits a home run with good-quality food in heaping portions, often with leftovers enough to provide dinner the following night, all at reasonable prices. At first glance the prices posted on the menu, a large plaque on the wall, might appear steep for so casual and bustling a place. Ten dollars for baked clams, $30 for a steak or $11 for linguine with broccoli are not exactly in the bargain category. But all the food comes in servings for two, so the $10 baked clams has a dozen of them, and the plates of pasta are ample for two or, as a first course, for three or four. The waiters dish out the portions at the table.
1986-09-28	NEW MANAGEMENT IN SOUTHAMPTON	THE precipitous decline that began affecting the venerable Herb McCarthy's Bowden Square in Southampton a decade or so ago has been arrested, and not a moment too soon. The man responsible for stopping the slide is Michael O'Keefe, who also owns the River Cafe in Brooklyn and the Water Club in Manhattan. The change came about this spring and the revisions, including some renovations of the interior, are not yet complete. This is an interim report but one of great promise.
1986-09-21	"DINING OUT;
A PUB WITH CAJUN DISHES, TOO"	"ON ROUTE 46 in Netcong is an Irish pub complete with piano player, Irish beer and a dining room. It is called Nellie Burke's, the name of the mother of the owner, Frank Burke.

This is Mr. Burke's second pub to have a full dining menu. The first was The Quiet Man in nearby Dover."
1986-09-21	VENTURING BEYOND THE BURRITO	FOR Mexican food that is tastier and more interesting than the combination platters served at the elaborate chain restaurants opening across Long Island, try Amigos in Port Washington. Originally a small storefront, it has added a second storefront, doubling the size without diminishing quality. It retains the look of some small restaurants in downtown Mexico City, evoking south-of-the-border atmosphere without making it look like Disneyworld. High ceilings, peach-colored walls, tables surfaced in colorful ceramic tiles and simple dark-wood benches and chairs, with a poster or two for decoration, is the simple scheme.
1986-09-21	PIQUANCY OF VIETNAM IN HARTFORD	VIETNAMESE cuisine is slowly making itself known in this country - and high time, too. Using many of the by now familiar ingredients of its Chinese neighbor, Vietnamese cooking has its own special distinction, a refreshingly sharp clarity that is unique. The Truc Orient Express in Hartford summarizes the fresh piquancy of Vietnamese cooking exceptionally well. Although it is one of a mere four Vietnamese restaurants in Connecticut, the name is better known in Massachusetts, where members of the Duong family have established a Truc Orient Express in West Stockbridge and in Springfield.
1986-09-14	FOR EVERY TASTE, AND THEN SOME	PORT ORIENT sounds as if it belongs on the road to Mandalay, not on Queens Boulevard. But there it is, moored in Forest Hills, Queens, among the kosher delis and Chinese, American and Italian restaurants. It dishes up half a dozen or more Asian cuisines. And just in case coconut milk and curry seasonings do not whet the appetite, the lengthy list of daily specials is inspired by other cultures: French escargots bourguignons and shrimp bisque, Italian veal marsala, Cajun pan-blackened salmon and some undefined continent represented by shrimp in amaretto cream. While these non-Oriental dishes may be creditable preparations, in a place like Port Orient the spirit should be more adventurous.
1986-09-07	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"The Merchandise Is Horse-Related Salem Saddlery in North Salem has tripled its former space for displaying equipment and clothing for horses and for riders of all ages and stages, from the backyard beginner or occasional rider to the show circuit. The store is a distributor for Miller's, the Manhattan retailer and wholesale supplier of horse-related merchandise, and supplies owners and commercial stables with hardware, barn supplies and grooming equipment -buckets, soaps, shampoos and hoof dressings.

Used English saddles are carried: on consignment they sell for $150 to $500. During September, 20 percent will be deducted from the charge for selected new saddles. The stock boots cost $130 to $190 and custom-made the charge is about $400. Breeches sell for $29 to $150 and stock leather chaps are $79 for a child and $89 for an adult. Custom chaps are $150 in any size."
1986-09-07	A FIND AT A TOURIST ATTRACTION	PRIME tourist attractions are not usually noted for fine dining, but Mystic is fortunate to have at least one such place, the Flood Tide restaurant, situated on a hill overlooking Mystic Harbor. To compound the improbables further, Flood Tide, though in a separate building, is part of a motel and inn complex - The Inn at Mystic - not always a promising place to find a good restaurant. Adding to the sense of well-being and anticipation in Flood Tide's two small softly lighted dining rooms is service by a trained staff that is both professional and of good cheer. The menu at Flood Tide is in the traditional, not trendy, mold, with a number of familiar dishes and a few surprises. Among the classics are beef Wellington, chateaubriand, and roast rack of baby lamb. We opted instead for an expertly prepared veal Zurich vol-au-vent (eminces of veal sauteed with fresh mushrooms and shallots in a crisp puff pastry shell); succulent broiled salmon steak with a dill-flecked hollandaise, and veal sweetbreads saute jambon (with a julienne of smoked ham and a whisper of mustard, served on a crusty toast round spread with a flavorful house pate), delicious but scant at $15.95.

1986-08-31	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"For the Very Young And the Slightly Older 

Baby Inspirations Juvenile and Teen-age Furniture in Ossining has furniture and equipment for babies through young adults at 30 to 60 percent off manufacturer's suggested retail prices on nationally advertised merchandise. It also has youth and adult bedding, children's lamps, linen layettes, books, mobiles, stuffed toys and children's Disney prints framed at the nearby Hudson River Gallery.

The 30-percent-off category covers woven wicker bassinets, high chairs, booster seats, Fisher-Price children's books and linen layettes. During September an additional discount of 20 percent applies to linen layettes -sheets, comforters, quilts, dust ruffles and bumpers. Changer tables are up to 50 percent off and cost between $80 and $250."
1986-08-31	"DINING OUT;
SPECIALTIES FROM NORTHERN ITALY"	"ITALIAN restaurants seem to sprout up in the Garden State like so many summer zucchini; but too few of them, alas, have the taste and panache one finds in the mother country.

And so to come across the unpretentious yet engaging little restaurant called La Catena, in a semi-residential neighborhood of Union County's Roselle Park, is like finding one of the best of the crop under a bushel basket.

Two cousins, Jimmy and Marcello Capello, opened La Catena two years ago to present delicious versions of their native northern Italian cooking and the table-side finishing that they and their chef practiced while working in Manhattan at such restaurants as Scarlatti and Tre Scalini.

The menu, which is in Italian with limited translations, offers a wide range including a dozen each of pasta and veal dishes plus simple grills and a quartet of daily specials (usually good bets) at prices from $9.50 to $15.95."
1986-08-31	TENDER BREEZE AND STEAMING FOOD	IT is still relatively rare to find a Connecticut restaurant where you can dine outside comfortably, at well-spaced tables, in an airy, bug-free environment. But if you are in the vicinity of Washington Depot, a new restaurant named Jonathan's is such a place. Jonathan's has indoor dining, too, in two uninspired rooms, but the large wooden deck, shielded from sun and rain by a striped awning, is where the action and breezes are. Waitresses deal crisply and efficiently with the demands of outdoor dining, and the food is actually hot when it reaches the table.
1986-08-31	INTERESTING INDIAN SPECIALTIES	TO the growing roster of Indian restaurants on the Island, add the Bombay Brasserie in East Meadow. The chef-owner was formerly with the luxurious Raga Restaurant in Manhattan, and he has brought some interesting specialties to Nassau County. Salad bars are everywhere these days and now even here in an Indian restaurant, with an assortment of marinated vegetables plus chick pea flour fritters in yogurt sauce (kadhi), the most interesting item in the array, but soggy. Opt instead for a la carte appetizers such as delicious batter-fried chicken tidbits called murg ke pakore to dip into fresh coriandor or mint chutney, or flaky, spicy samosa turnovers stuffed with potatoes and peas. Tiny vegetable fritters called gharam lukme were intriguing nibbles. Mini-kebabs of chicken and lamb are also among the appetizers, but were rather dry.
1986-08-29	Revisiting a duo on the West Side	WHEN the Odeon opened six years ago, it was a lonely lighthouse in the remote and deserted port of TriBeCa. The restaurant's casual and stylish ambiance, good food and congenial service drew an enthusiastic crowd from the downtown artistic community - the type of people who believed 11 P.M. was a fashionable hour for dinner. TriBeCa, of course, is much changed today, dotted with all types of flashy restaurants and bistros. The Odeon has changed, too, and not necessarily for the better. At first glance, it appears the same. The Art Deco former cafeteria has a long bar against one wall, a tile floor and bistro tables crammed in tighter than cars in a midtown parking lot. On busy evenings, which is to say all the time, the din is loud enough to wilt your salad. One soon notices, though, that some of the crackling artistic energy that once made this scene so diverting is fading as the clientele metamorphoses from brash bohemian cool to corporate gray. Seven-thirty is now a popular time to dine.
1986-08-24	Where Steak and Lobster Reign	THE Hedges Inn in East Hampton opened early in July under the management of the Palm. It could be called Palm Too, for the branch of the Palm in Manhattan. While the printed menu is somewhat more varied than at the Palm in East Hampton, the food is virtually the same, so steaks and lobsters head the list of items worth ordering. An occasional fish special can be satisfying as well when it is not overcooked.
1986-08-17	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Cold-Country Oak, Made in the U.S.A.

Oak Classics Ltd. in the Bazaar Mall of Mount Kisco is a source of solid northern red oak reproduction furniture in traditional home and office designs with some modifications to accommodate storage for entertainment-center equipment or modern sliders for file-cabinet drawers. The hardier and grainier woods from colder states are used, not veneers, and dovetail finishing and glue are relied upon, not nails. Each furniture piece is made in the United States, but among the brass accessories are some from India or areas of the Far East.

Special prices for the grand opening sale remain until Sept. 15. This means that the cost of the largest rolltop desk - 36 by 66 inches and 585 pounds - suggested to retail at $4,999.95 becomes $2,695.95 here. The drawer pulls are hand-carved, the fittings are of brass and three or four secret compartments are included. Smaller rolltops are displayed: at 48 or 54 inches, each at just under $900, or the smallest at 42 inches for pennies off $600 during the opening sale."
1986-08-17	LUNCHES THAT PLEASE THE EYE, TOO	WHERE can you go for a good but inexpensive lunch? If you are in Darien, the answer is easy: The Gourmet Table. This attractive little restaurant, which calls itself more aptly a cafe and patisserie (and also does catering), wisely limits itself to a handful of dishes and masters them flawlessly. How refreshing to find food with the intensity of market-fresh, natural components and dishes made without shortcutting on the best ingredients. Taste tells.
1986-08-17	BANKS HEAT UP CREDIT-CARD WAR	PEG ROOT, a vice president at the Connecticut National Bank, said the 11.75 percent rate the bank is offering on credit-card balances this summer is so popular that the printer of the cards, the Atlanta Company, has had trouble obtaining enough plastic. Things are also hectic around the bank headquarters in Hartford, she said. ''We've had to bring in temporary people to handle all the applications,'' Ms. Root said. Five of the six banks that issue major credit cards in the state have dropped their rates well below the new state interest-rate cap of 15 percent for credit cards, in what many banking executives call a rate war.
1986-08-17	JAPANESE MENU WITH A DIFFERENCE	TAKESUSHI, which opened recently in Great Neck, has a restaurant in Manhattan as well as locations in other cities here and abroad, including Brussels. The Great Neck branch offers a different menu from the others, featuring kushi-yaki dinners, which involve cooking various meats, poultry, seafood and vegetables on skewers at the table. Although it is a unique feature, this specialty is the least appealing aspect of dining at Takesushi, and without this emphasis - including the tables constructed to accommodate it - the restaurant might merit two stars. Perhaps the theory is that everyone in the suburbs has a barbecue grill and even when dining out, residents of this area still enjoy giving a skewer an occasional turn. The servers do the actual cooking here, and when the electric recessed grill in the middle of the table is uncovered and lighted, the heat radiating from this appliance is uncomfortable. If kushi-yaki is your choice, best have it cooked in the kitchen instead of at the table.
1986-08-16	FANUEIL HALL MARKETPLACE AFTER 10 YEARS	Not even last week's tornado warnings dissuaded tourists by the tens of thousands from inching, gawking, eating and slurping their way through the old Quincy Market, which was renovated 10 years ago this month and transformed into a kind of upscale carnival. The sunnier weather that followed packed in about 100,000 more. Boston, as everyone knows, has blossomed again over the last two decades. It has restored its crumbling buildings and erected monumental new ones, attracted young people and started up new busineses. The Quincy Market has been an important symbol of this renewal.
1986-08-10	AN OLD STATION ON THE RIGHT TRACK	THE Station in Water Mill is a stunner. The former railroad station, which had been used as a boutique and a thrift shop for a number of years, was recycled as a handsome restaurant last year. Only some vintage railway posters for the romantic Orient Express and such, and the occasional deafening roar as the Long Island Rail Road rumbles past, reveal the previous use of these premises. Actually, the general buzz of conversations bouncing off the high, arched ceiling of the small dining room when the place is filled can be more intrusive than the trains. And on sultry nights, the room can also be on the stuffy side.
1986-08-08	RESTAURANTS	OF all the culinary trends that have sprouted in New York City in recent years, however fleeting, one that has thrown strong roots and become part of the landscape is so-called California cuisine. This winsome approach to cooking involves minimalist techniques of grilling and sauteing fish and meat, and mating them with light, vegetable-based sauces and enough fresh greenery to make a nutritionist swoon. Though clearly derivative of French nouvelle cuisine, California cuisine, with regional accents ranging from Tex-Mex to New England, is distinctly all-American. Whatever one thinks of this Garden of Eden style of cooking, it must be acknowledged that the two-and-a-half-year-old Jams, the first major California restaurant to open in New York, remains the pre-eminent practitioner in the city. This upbeat, two-level establishment on East 79th Street, with its rakish and well-heeled clientele has maintained a high level of food and service. Though some customers grumble about paying $23 for grilled chicken with french fries, they continue to pay up - you won't find a meatier, tastier grilled chicken anywhere, and the haystack of thin, brittle french fries is the best in town.
1986-08-03	"DINING OUT;
WELCOME SURPRISE AT THE SHORE"	"AFTER stepping around barefoot beachgoers clutching ice cream cones on the sidewalk outside, there is a feeling of serendipity when you enter Cafe Loren. Who would expect such a pretty countrified restaurant to occupy the unpretentious building sandwiched behind the neon-lit Avalon Freeze.

Along the shore, where so many eateries offer little more than combination seafood platters and boisterous informality, the Cafe Loren (which is in the town of Avalon, south of Ocean City) comes as a welcome surprise, what with its homey, candlelit ambience and imaginative, if occasionally uneven, fare.

The 75-seat restaurant was taken over three years ago by a trio of young owners: Patty and Mark Rutledge and William Montanari, the chef, who studied at the Culinary Institute of America and apprenticed in a couple of Bucks County inns."
1986-08-03	"DINING OUT;
NEW SEAFOOD SPOT IN YONKERS"	"MAJOR renovation has spruced up considerably the quarters last occupied by A Family Affair. Although we wish the cooking were better, The Seafood Peddler has, nevertheless, much in its favor. Attractive illumination, high ceilings, bright green padded booths, a few thickly cushioned peacock chairs and blond laminated woods give a luxurious edge to what is basically an unpretentious dining spot, one that seeks to please a large segment of the general public.

One of the restaurant's most enticing features is the circular bar sunk into the center of the tiered dining room. On a portion of the counter a refrigerator showcase displays on a bed of crushed ice what we assume is that day's stock of seafood. At a station behind the bar a short-order cook works three round-bottomed double boilers (like those used at Grand Central Terminal's Oyster Bar), which swivel on hinges, allowing him to tip out the contents into serving bowls. It's fun to watch the process from the bar or nearby tables."
1986-08-03	GOOD CAJUN COOKING, AND MORE	ALTHOUGH the name J-Dave's is as much a play on K-Paul's Louisiana kitchen in New Orleans as the blackened salmon on the menu is borrowed from Paul Prudhomme's blackened redfish, this fairly new place in Patchogue is not strictly Cajun. The Cajun food is very good, however, and the rest, an eclectic mix, is nearly as satisfying. The small former bar and grill has been spruced up in retro-deco style. The handsome bar dominates the room, done in rose and gray. Despite upholstered banquettes and a carpeted floor, the noise can be deafening, however, reverberating off the high ceilings. It's the only drawback to the otherwise felicitous setting.
1986-07-27	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"A HARDWARE STORE THAT HAS WORN WELL -Brewers Hardware and Marine Center was established in 1879 in Mamaroneck, and the fifth generation of the family is supplying household and general hardware and marine supplies in the main store, and a gardening-needs outlet and The Woodworker's Store both downhill toward the Post Road Boat Yard. Now a True Value Hardware Store, Brewers participates in monthly group promotions, with its own specials seasonally on building and plumbing materials, marine paints and rigging assemblies, lifejackets and slickers.

Air-conditioners, fireplace inserts, barbecue supplies and wood stoves are available; gardening supplies include fencing, marble chips, fertilizers, hoses, rotary spreaders and applicator systems.

Linda Meehan, who manages The Woodworker's Store that opened four years ago, has taken woodworking courses similar to the beginner-to-advanced instructions offered at the shop each September through spring."
1986-07-27	WHERE NO SIGN IS A GOOD SIGN	STARR BOGGS, the chef, who opened Starr Boggs, the restaurant, in Westhampton Beach on Memorial Day Weekend, is one of the individuals responsible for the high quality of cooking in Quogue and Westhampton over the last few seasons. His latest venture is small, gray within and without, and, as of this writing, has no sign. But the lack of some exterior identification has not hurt business. No one seems to have trouble locating it, all the tables are filled and reservations, especially on weekends, must be obtained many days in advance. Starr Boggs attracts many regular customers and people who are also personally acquainted with some of the Long Island wine makers whose products are featured on the wine list. There is an atmosphere of clubby familiarity about the place.
1986-07-21	Chase Credit Card Job To McCaffrey & McCall	McCaffrey & McCall Direct Marketing has won the advertising account of the Credit Card division of Chase Manhattan Bank after a search that had included 16 agencies.
1986-07-20	"DINING OUT;
A STRIKING CONTRAST IN CAPE MAY"	"IN A SEASIDE resort like Cape May, where the clock seemed to stop at the turn of the century and the gingerbread trim on the houses speaks more of 1886 than today, the contrast is striking.

Here one will find a bustling little restaurant specializing in au courant, all-American mesquite grills and zesty Cajun fare. And to cap off its eclectic nature, the chef, Sing Cheng, is from Hong Kong. 410 Bank Street, as the informal restaurant is called, is now in its third season - it is closed from November until May - in a converted old house a few blocks from the beach.

Tables are shoe-horned into every available spot, from the tiny screened porch up front to the simply decorated little main dining room. The best ones, however, are out back, where they occupy the plant-rimmed patio and snug veranda."
1986-07-20	WHERE THE PASTA IS IN ITS PRIME	THE welcome at La Trattoria Italiana in Roslyn Heights is enhanced by a glimpse of the appetizers and desserts displayed on a table near the bar. The ingredients for an excellent cold antipasto -slices of fried zucchini and fried eggplant marinated in olive oil with herbs and abundant garlic, sauteed mushrooms and nobs of fresh mozzarella cheese with basil and tomato - are arrayed on platters. Beginning a dinner with this assortment is wise. Another appetizer, mussels steamed in a garlic-infused white wine sauce flecked with parsley, is an equally fine starter. The delectably fragrant golden sauce begs to be spooned up, sopped up with bread or scooped up with empty mussel shells or whatever else is handy. Even licking it up would constitute pardonable breach of etiquette.
1986-07-20	BRASSERIE ORIGINALITY IN BRIDGEPORT	IF one were giving out report cards, Paris Bistro, a new brasserie-type restaurant in Bridgeport, would earn an A for creativity. Given the clonelike quality of so many restaurant menus, it is refreshing to find one these days with nary a clams casino, blackened redfish or chocolate mousse in sight. What is evident, though, is a striving for originality on a menu that is trying to meld nouvelle cuisine techniques with New American ideas. Never mind if the results often produce no more than a gentlemanly C, one commends the attempt.
1986-07-18	RESTAURANTS	THE Broadway theater district is not exactly a shining chorus line of quality res taurants. Theatergoers face depressing odds when trying to choose a dining spot at random - it's sort of like trying to pick a play solely by looking at marquees. One place that I often recommend with confidence is Orso, the sunny and casual Italian restaurant on West 46th Street specializing in moderately priced pastas, individual pizzas and grilled entrees. Orso is owned by Joe Allen, whose namesake restaurant is next door, and is managed by family members. The front room has a small bar flanked by several tables and followed by a step-down main dining room under an arching skylight that makes for a cheerful setting at lunch. The restaurant is done in clean tans and oak, sporting celebrity photos on the walls and an open tile-and-steel kitchen in the rear. In recent years Orso has become somewhat of a youthful Sardi's as theater people mingle with agents and journalists over salads and thin-crusted pizzas. Even the comely and generally efficient young service staff exudes a certain dramatic flair, although not in an overbearing way.
1986-07-13	"DINING OUT;
WHEN THE LOCATION IS AN ASSET"	"CONSIDERING how many Chinese restaurants there are in New Jersey, it's amazing how difficult it is to find one that can be truly recommended. Often, there are one or two good dishes hidden among several truly awful ones. Or, all of the dishes are mediocre.

Popularity isn't necessarily a guide, either. I have sat through many unsuccessful meals in crowded Chinese restaurants, and have eaten better ones in establishments that were practically empty. It seems that Chinese restaurants, more than any other, suffer from the problem of location."
1986-07-13	A PLEASING CHINESE PIECEMEAL	ON Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton, H.S.F. has proved to be a reliable addition to the year-round dining scene in the Hamptons. In an area notable for its seasonal fluctuations, it is remarkable that H.S.F. has managed to be such a perennial. The dining room of the long building is done in cool pastel periwinkle blue with black accents. A sleek metal ceiling adds style and shine to the tastefully understated setting. Seating is comfortable and tables are well spaced. The black bar area spotlighted with pinpoints of light is useful when there is a wait for tables.
1986-07-08	MACHINES TO SELL L.I.R.R. TICKETS BY CREDIT CARD	Kevin Fehn slipped his Visa card through a machine at Pennsylvania Station yesterday. Thirty seconds later, the machine's computer punched out a monthly commutation ticket for Mineola. Mr. Fehn, a passenger agent for the Long Island Rail Road, was testing one of two such machines that will go into service at Penn Station later this week. The machines accept Visa and Mastercard.
1986-07-06	Don't Leave the Union Hall Without It	Not only union members but also non-members in a new ''associate'' category will benefit from low-cost legal services and a low-interest credit card announced by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last week. The federation said its ''Union Privilege Legal Services'' and ''Union Privilege Mastercard,'' to be issued by the Bank of New York either free or at a bargain price to the credit-worthy, would be made available to about 5 million of the 13.1 million members of A.F.L.-C.I.O. unions this year, to all members next year and then to former members and certain non-members. Labor leaders consider the new services a step toward providing union members with benefits beyond collective bargaining - and as an organizing tactic, that will reach out to new kinds of workers.
1986-07-02	NEWS SUMMARY: WEDNESDAY, JULY 2, 1986	International A Soviet official said Moscow had proposed an approach for rescheduling talks between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in prepartion for a summit meeting. The State Department expressed surprise, saying that no formal proposal had been received. The Soviet statement appeared to refer to a recent letter from Mikhail S. Gorbachev to President Reagan suggesting a way of clearing obstacles blocking a summit meeting. [ Page A1, Column 6. ] A bomb exploded in Johannesburg, wounding eight people. The blast occurred in a downtown store. [ A1:5. ]
1986-07-02	UNIONISTS TO GET LOW-INTEREST CREDIT CARDS	The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations today announced a new benefits plan that will offer its 13.1 million members free low-interest credit cards and discount legal services. The ''Union Privilege Mastercard'' will be the lowest-priced nationally distributed credit card, the labor federation said. The cards will be issued by the Bank of New York, which will also make decisions about whether to issue credit to individual union members. The new program is seen by labor federation officials as a prelude to providing union members with benefits beyond collective bargaining, including supplemental health insurance, an individual retirement account program and life insurance.
1986-06-29	"NUMISMATICS;
NEW MINT DESIGN"	"The Statue of Liberty centennial appears to have generated more medallic tributes than any single event since the U.S. Bicentennial. One of the most significant is a proof set which includes 11 new medals designed by Frank Gasparro, who served for many years as a chief sculptor-engraver of the United States Mint.

''The Greatness of America'' is the medals' theme, and the Statue of Liberty is the element that unifies the set. The reverse of each medal carries a common design featuring a likeness of Liberty's head. This is coupled, in each case, with an obverse portrait honoring a person or persons who played a major role in making America great."
1986-06-29	THE EXOTIC 'NEW AMERICAN' TOUCH	EFFORTS at translating concept into cuisine continue with moderate success in some restaurants, such as Crooked Hill in Commack, that subscribe to the ''new American'' philosophy. The menu offers an enticing, contemporary and stylish list; the food lives up to expectations intermittently. Among the hallmarks of restaurants of this type, which have only recently become established in this area, are fresh ingredients often given exotic or unexpected touches. The flash of chili on duck, fresh ginger with fish, mellow braised garlic and sauces based on California varietal wines are typical and considerately described in plain English on the menu.
1986-06-22	THE EVOLUTUION OF A PIZZA PARLOR	THE metamorphosis of Casa Albona in Amagansett is complete. To those with long memories, it was a mecca for families with children who craved pizza and pasta. Gradually, over the decades (yes, decades), the pizza was relegated to the porch, then eliminated from the bill of fare entirely, and a somewhat tonier point of view gradually prevailed. Not just spaghetti and other old-time pastas, but tortellini and fettuccine in cream sauces became available to satisfy the growing, sophisticated taste for northern Italian food. Some of the lustier preparations, such as the linguine with white clam sauce or the baked ziti, continued to delight.
1986-06-15	"DINING OUT;
PERSONAL TOUCH TO ITALIAN CUISINE"	"PEREGRINE'S is a spiffy little restaurant tucked in a corner of an Irvington building designed in the early 1890's by Stanford White. The Cosmopolitan Building, as it was originally known, housed the executive offices of that magazine and has since provided, at one time or another, space for some Hearst publications and for a film studio in the days of the silents. Neglected though it may be, the architecture is still worth an admiring look.

Thus, in a way, Peregrine's calls attention to two endangered species and in an incidental spirit of preservation restores to this riverfront structure some of its erstwhile glory. The food, too, is revivalist. While the menu announces tired old dishes, the chef re-invents and re-creates them, putting a personal edge to what is essentially Italian cuisine and producing dish after dish of juicy viands with subtle sauces, all in generous portion."
1986-06-15	SUSHI IN THE RAW AND THE ROUND	THE distinctive feature of Junko, a Japanese restaurant in a less-than-glamorous motel complex in Huntington, is its sushi bar in the round. Actually an elongated oval, the freestanding sushi bar does allow for seating all around and can accommodate a large number of customers who enjoy not only the sushi but also the bantering give-and-take with the genial artisan-chefs. The sushi is commendable, with a fairly typical array of seafood including tuna, fluke, yellowtail (a type of tuna), mackerel, tilefish, smoked salmon, tender octopus, giant clam, eel, sea urchin, surimi (processed crabmeat product), shrimp and the roe of herring, flying fish and salmon. Cone-shaped hand rolls filled with various fish and vegetables with rice and seaweed, cylindrical sushi rolls stuffed with tuna or cucumber, and handsome inside-out rolls, with the rice on the outside, were all excellent.
1986-06-08	A STEP OUT OF THE TEX-MEX MOLD	FOR years, Mexican restaurants in Connecticut numbered less than a handful. Suddenly there are more, and while not yet a runaway trend, the signs are encouraging. The newest is Azteca's in New Haven. Located just off State Street (an area undergoing a revival), Azteca's welcomes the diner instantly with a decor that is stylishly minimal, but effective, focusing on an artful placing of enormous cacti, ''framed'' like still lifes against pink-trimmed, cream-colored walls.
1986-06-08	A NEW OWNER AND A NEW OUTLOOK	THE first change you may notice at Caminari's, a 47-year-old landmark in Locust Valley that acquired a new owner-chef two months ago, is the dinnerware. The restaurant is using the basket pattern that has been the signature of a number of top French chefs. Although these dishes broadcast a nouvelle cuisine signal, the change in the cooking is far subtler. Caminari's remains a Continental restaurant retaining many familiar dishes. Others have been varied, but not startlingly. For example, instead of the traditional mussels steamed in white wine with shallots, the mussels are now served carefully arrayed on the half shell, warm and napped with a white wine and chive cream sauce for an expression of comfortable originality.
1986-06-08	NORTHEAST JOURNAL	Making a Call From Metroliner - WITH just the slide of a credit card, busy travelers between New York and Washington can call the limo to meet them at the station, or the pizza parlor to deliver piping hot pepperoni for the precise time they will arrive home. If they are riding a Metroliner, that is. Amtrak introduced telephone service last week, with a minimum of three phones on each of its 12 Metroliners in each direction daily. Passengers need one of five major credit cards - American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club or Carte Blanche - to insert into the slot of the new Railfone. They can dial directly anywhere in the country, including Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico. The cost is $5 for the first three minutes and $1 for each additional minute. The phones take no coins and do not receive calls.
1986-06-01	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Gemstone Cornucopia At Factory Outlet Embraceables - established in the county four years ago and based in North White Plains as a costume-jewelry factory for the last two years -is having a two-day inventory clearance at wholesale prices or below Saturday from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. and next Sunday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Checks can be accepted with two identifications but not credit cards.

Quiet, elegant designs are assembled here as well as the brightly colored country-club look; some teen-age favorites are romantic bows and hearts or chains and hoop earrings, and still other works hark to Art Deco, Victorian motifs, primitive decorations or the Far East.

Rhinestones, pearls, beads (wood, plastic, glass and German, Czechoslovak or Austrian crystal), acrylics, plated metals and natural materials (tortoise, ebony, bone, black and red coral, mother of pearl, betel nut, cowhorn and black and white buffalo horn) are used for bracelets, pins, necklaces, belts and clip and stud earrings."
1986-06-01	"DINING OUT;
STOREFRONT DINING IN MAPLEWOOD"	"THANK goodness for restaurant owners who write to reviewers, asking that they come to their restaurants. Without them, many charming places might never be discovered by any but local diners.

In her letter, Suzanne Guariglua, an interior designer who, with her husband Joe, was the first owner of Suzanne's Petite Maison in Maplewood, not only described her restaurant but also enclosed several menus interesting enough to indicate that a visit would be worthwhile.

The restaurant changed hands two months ago, and is now owned by Tom and Holly Guber. Mrs. Guber has worked in several restaurants (primarily in the front of the house), including Chez Catherine in Westfield and the Warwick Hotel in Philadelphia."
1986-06-01	CLASSIC FARE WITH MODERN FLAIR	SOUTHAMPTON'S colonial Post House has a menu as new as today. Stylish food created with contemporary flair is combined with several enduring classics, all of which whet the appetite. More inspiration in the actual cooking and this would be an unqualified winner; as it is, the results are an uneven blend of delights and disappointments. A bowl heaped with steaming mussels, fresh as a breeze and bathed in a white wine and cream sauce, is a fine starter. A larger portion could do for an uncommonly satisfying main dish. Better bread, a loaf with a good crisp crust instead of the puffy, eggy variety served on a wooden board, would be more suitable for dunking. Clam fritters, a bit doughy but well seasoned, were a decent first course, and the sparkling oysters on the half shell could not be faulted. Leek and potato soup was smooth and honest, a puree that required only a bit of salt.
1986-05-25	LAVISH TASTES FROM THE TANDOOR	MOGHUL feasts have been whetting Long Island appetites lately. Akbar, at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, is one of the newer Indian restaurants, open about a month. It is a branch of a restaurant by the same name on Park Avenue in Manhattan. The restaurant is large, but seating on plush banquettes and in alcoves creates a sense of intimacy. The softly lighted contemporary decor is highlighted by colorful, stylized stained-glass panels. Tables are sumptuously set with brass service plates.
1986-05-25	A FRESH TASTE OF MEXICO	THE few Mexican restaurants in Connecticut tend to follow a borderline fast-food pattern of similarity. What a pleasant surprise, then, to find Cafe de Olla in Winsted. Even in decor, Cafe de Olla creates its own image. In limited space - one small room - a brick rear wall with balcony suggests a Mexican house, with big plants in large, earthenware pots, or ollas. There is not a sombrero or serape in sight.
1986-05-18	PASTA AND 'PERSONAL PIZZAS'	MENUS that feature individual pizzas and unusual pastas like that of Galleria in Garden City South capitalize on the kind of trendy, informal cafe dining that is becoming increasing popular. Instead of the old-fashioned pizzeria where plates of spaghetti are also served, places like Galleria offer a more gracious setting and good wines to go with creative little pizzas and bowls of pasta. Galleria has the right idea, and if your choices are limited to the pasta, you will be served generous portions of edible food. The fettuccine Bolognese, consisting of noodles in a forthright tomato and meat sauce; the fusilli primavera, with corkscrew pasta and pieces of bright vegetables mixed in a light cream sauce, and even the slightly doughy multicolored (green, red and white) tortellini in a creamy tomato sauce with vegetables were acceptable.
1986-05-16	RESTAURANTS	NANNI IL VALLETTO, the glamorous younger sibling of the homespun Nanni on East 46th Street, is one of the more splendiferous Italian restaurants in town - and expensive, too. Every evening a soigne parade of perennially tanned gentlemen in dark European-cut suits escorted by polished and bejeweled ladies glides past the little horseshoe-shaped bar in front where they are greeted warmly by the staff. Luigi Nanni himself, a gruff yet endearing host, may come to the table, dismiss the menu with a wave of the hand, and suggest an assortment of the daily specials. If you happen to be one of these lucky and pampered few, you could be in for a truly serendipitous evening of food and wine fit for a Venetian prince. If you are an unknown, however, it's possible to feel like a commoner at the royal banquet. One privilege of entering the regal circle is being seated at the cozy dining area between the bar and the grandiose main salon. The larger dining room isn't exactly second-rate, though; it is an imposing space, with a soaring ceiling, gold-striped wallpaper, towering mirrors, opulent flowers and comfortable banquettes.
1986-05-09	RESTAURANTS	WHEN Cafe Luxembourg opened three years ago it became an overnight hit, a stylish and serious restaurant in the gastronomic tundra surrounding Lincoln Center. Unaccountably, the success of this Art Deco haute cafeteria has failed to spawn worthy imitators. Aside from a few glorified watering holes in the neighborhood, Cafe Luxembourg still has the hip night scene pretty much to itself. Monopolies such as these often breed complacency, but this case, I am happy to report, is an exception. Four recent visits found the food to be fresh, imaginatively executed and surprisingly consistent. Service, while casual in a bistro manner, was unfailingly genial and earnest. Some may find the quarters a bit too neighborly and obstreperous at times, but overall I consider Cafe Luxembourg to be one of the more diverting late-night dining options in town - similar in many ways to its TriBeCa sibling, the Odeon. Every evening a polymorphic parade of Upper West Siders passes the gleaming zinc bar up front into the sleek tile dining room with its period sconces, Parisian cafe chairs and red banquettes. The dark-suited local gentry and business types hold forth from about 8 to 10 P.M., academia and literati settle in next, and after 11, restless young fast-trackers, meticulously disheveled and in buoyant spirits, linger until closing.
1986-05-04	FORMER DISCO SOUNDS A NEW NOTE	NICOLE'S in Port Washington once was partly a discotheque, but now has taken a more serious turn with a new chef and a French-Continental menu. Conceptually it is still in a state of flux because plans are afoot to provide entertainment or jazz on weekends. But the food is on the right track. The preparation is dependably good with occasional flashes of brilliance. Service is often a liability, however. On crowded nights it lags, and more apologies and explanations are offered than plates of food.
1986-05-04	BIG LABOR TRIES TO END ITS NIGHTMARE	GROPING for escape from the troubles that enshroud America's unions, the high command of organized labor is thinking the unthinkable to a degree unparalleled in union history. Rules considered inviolable since the founding of the modern movement a century ago are being swept aside in a multi-pronged effort at self-help by union chiefs. Increasingly, they are substituting coordination for costly internecine competition in their campaigns to organize the four-fifths of the work force still outside union ranks. In an even sharper break with tradition, labor's top officials now want to get in on the ground floor of any strike - or any bargaining - of national significance, not just be there at the end to pick up the pieces of a local union in disarray. The principal architect of the push to revitalize the movement through concerted action is Lane Kirkland, the soft-spoken technocrat who heads the A.F.L.-C.I.O. In the six years since he succeeded George Meany as federation president, he has used his own distinctive brand of conciliation and consultation to win from the potentates who rule its key affiliates a respect comparable to that once accorded his imperious mentor. Despite the steady worsening of labor's fortunes, which had begun under Mr. Meany, Mr. Kirkland believes a reversal can come through giving the central body an early voice in efforts to keep bargaining disputes from producing yet more headaches for labor.
1986-05-04	Look for the Union Card	The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s program to provide union members with a free low-interest credit card is gathering momentum. The American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees has just agreed to bring its one million members into the program, bringing to nine the number of participating unions and to four million the total number of covered workers.
1986-05-03	CHEMICAL PLANS A COMBINED ACCOUNT	The Chemical Bank will introduce an all-in-one bank account next week - combining savings, checking, retirement planning, and credit card statements - in its latest push to dislodge Citibank from the No. 1 spot in New York consumer banking. Chemical is now No. 2. The new Chemplus account is part of a trend in the banking industry modeled after an account that Citibank began offering just over a year ago. Citibank says its account, known as Citi-One, has attracted new business from customers who find it convenient to have their accounts consolidated. Citi-One places all of a customer's accounts under one overall account number and provides an integrated statement covering savings, checking and Individual Retirement Accounts and Visa or Mastercard transactions.
1986-04-27	"DINING OUT;
BUCKS COUNTY: A PLUS AND A MINUS"	"WITH the warmer days and breaking buds of spring, thoughts turn to a ramble in the countryside capped, perhaps, with dinner at a rustic inn.

Fortunately, that part of Pennsylvania's Bucks County along the Delaware retains its scenic charms and sprinkling of inviting inns. There, two auberges, one old and one recently established, beckon with their romantic ambiance. Both The Inn at Phillips Mill and Rambouillet have a handful of antiques-furnished rooms for overnight guests and charming dining rooms open to the public."
1986-04-27	TV SHOPPING BRINGS THE MALL TO THE HOME	Susanne Birkner was sitting home, bored, flipping the cable channels one night, and there suddenly, on 29, was the Home Shopping Network, a new national show offering shopping by television for hours on end. Mrs. Birkner could not believe something so fabulous would happen in her lifetime. It was like having the Bergen Mall in her living room. Her husband, Ron, loves television shopping, too. They watch together starting at midnight, when he gets home from the late shift. Sometimes when the show offers one of its Bargainathons, Mr. Birkner shouts, ''Call! Call! Call!'' Then Mrs. Birkner rushes to the phone, pulls out her MasterCard, dials the toll-free number and charges.
1986-04-27	A FRENCH STAR LOSES ONE	LA MASCOTTE in Commack was last reviewed a year ago and received three stars. This February the restaurant moved to new, larger quarters a few hundred yards away, but it has a similar French country look. Much of what was commendable about La Mascotte before the move - notably the careful service, attractive presentation and good wine list - is still evident. But based on several recent visits, the cooking did not maintain the same consistently high level, especially at lunch. And with but a couple of exceptions, desserts are very disappointing. La Mascotte remains one of the better French restaurants on the Island and could certainly recapture a third star, but at present it seems to have slipped from that level.
1986-04-22	PRIME RATE IS CUT TO 8 1/2% BY BANKS	Banks across the nation yesterday lowered their prime lending rate, to which a broad spectrum of loans is tied, by half a point, to 8 1/2 percent. That is its lowest level since 1978. The action quickly followed the Federal Reserve's decision Friday to lower the rate it charges on loans to financial institutions to 6 1/2 percent from 7 percent. ''The Fed ratified the movement in short-term rates,'' said Daniel T. Van Dyke, head of the United States forecasting service at the Bank of America. ''It gave the banks confidence in the direction of rates.''
1986-04-20	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Renovation Sale At Bally Outlet Shoppers already on the mailing list and those who drop in at the Bally Outlet in New Rochelle know of the additional 25 percent off on the red-dotted items - men's and ladies' shoes, boots, jackets, briefcases, wallets, handbags, belts and ties. When the remodeling sale ends next Sunday, the outlet will close for six weeks, reopening after renovation. Two other Bally Outlets are in Secaucus, N.J. and Orlando, Fla.

The Bally Outlet location and the corporate headquarters are at One Bally Place, New Rochelle, N.Y. 10801 (use Exit 16 off I-95, going left at the stop sign, then the first right to under the train trestle, and at the second light, turn right again and the Bally sign will be visible). Open Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Thursday 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Saturday 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. and Sunday noon to 5 P.M."
1986-04-20	"DINING OUT;
STYLISH AND INVENTIVE IN OSSINING"	"CAFE is a misnomer for this stylish restaurant. Behind the demure, lacy half-curtains in the storefront window stretches a serene dining room, simplicity itself in line and shape - just a hint of curve in the ornamental curlicues of the mirror frames - with a modern-classic juxtaposition of style contrived to surprise and please, one that is echoed enthusiastically in the kitchen's culinary efforts.

Although Cafe Keenan has a new chef, the quality of the cooking hasn't changed appreciably. Fresh, interesting ingredients are still prepared in inventive ways. And no wonder. The new chef, David Shakin, comes to Cafe Keenan from Jillyflower's and the delightful and delicious influence of its chef, Mark Filipo, whose bright culinary ideas have much to do with the success of the new menus. This is not to say that every dish issuing from the kitchen scores; however, when one doesn't, at least the attempts are superior."
1986-04-20	MODERN ITALIAN IN COLONIAL SETTING	WHAT was once a modest Italian eatery has metamorphosed, under new ownership, into a modern, stylized version of a colonial tavern, with a wooded fireplace frame and mantle tacked against a wall, Windsor chairs, and two homey bookcases filled with old volumes. Dubonnet tablecloths and carpet, fresh flowers and soft lighting all create a warm, agreeable, unpretentious dining atmosphere. Excess diners -often those without reservations on bustling weekend evenings - spill over to tables in the attractive, but smoky, taproom-bar facing the entrance. So intent on suggesting another era is Cooper Tavern, that it even lists its Route 7, Ridgefield, address as 37 Ethan Allen Highway.
1986-04-20	HOT CEVAPCICI ON THE EAST END	AT MIRKO'S in Water Mill, the Continental menu is interpreted more broadly than usual. It includes Yugoslavian specialties prepared by the chef and owner, Mirko Zagar, who is from Yugoslavia. Tucked into the rear of a shopping complex, the restaurant is small and cozy in a provincial way, a particulary inviting atmosphere during the off-season (it remains open year-round), and just low-key enough during the summer. Over the last couple of years it has built a devoted following of customers who delight in the sumptuous desserts as much as in the rest of the food, which has been prepared with an increasingly sure hand.
1986-04-13	GENEROUS HELPINGS OF SEAFOOD	CONTRARY to many restaurateurs' perceptions, all restaurant reviewers are not curmudgeons whose day is made when they can criticize a restaurant mercilessly. Nothing gives a reviewer greater pleasure than finding a culinary paradise, fit for lavish praise. Conversely, one of the saddest experiences is to find a new restaurant where the decor exudes cheerfulness and the staff and management are obviously trying to please, but where the end product misses the mark. Such is the case at Scrimshaw's of Ridgefield, a small seafood eatery lodged in a long, storefront building. Attention has been paid to the pleasing decor, with its pale-pink walls and table napery, wood floor, fresh flowers and hanging plants. Eager and friendly waitresses do their best to satisfy diners' wishes, even providing doggy bags for taking home parts of the extremely generous portions.
1986-04-13	A STYLISH TURN, A FEW DETOURS	ALTHOUGH Villa D'Ric in Syosset became Chez Arturo back in August and the sign out front has been changed, the menus are still labeled with the previous name. But under the new owner and chef, much of the cooking has taken a stylish, sophisticated turn. There are some bumpy detours as well, which prevent the restaurant from reaching a two-star destination. The bread, reheated, sometimes a trifle charred and of pedestrian quality, is one example. And some inept preparations, so unlikely in view of the many fine dishes served here, almost seem to come from a different kitchen entirely. Desserts are a disaster that in some cases have languished too long before being served.
1986-04-13	FRAUD SUGGESTED IN LaROUCHE FUND-RAISING	A Federal prosecutor's affidavit says preliminary findings in a grand jury investigation indicate that organizations affiliated with Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. have raised money by defrauding hundreds of people across the country. The 18-month grand jury inquiry, in Boston, is one of several overlapping civil and criminal investigations of LaRouche groups being carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Election Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Secret Service. An affidavit filed in Federal District Court in Boston by the office of United States Attorney William F. Weld said the investigation's early findings ''indicate an extensive nationwide pattern'' of credit card fraud by LaRouche operatives, leading to ''hundreds of unauthorized charges apparently totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.'' Wrongdoing Is Denied Many of the records of the inquiries normally would be secret but have become public because they were filed in court in response to lawsuits and other legal actions Mr. LaRouche has initiated against the Government. Mr. LaRouche and his associates deny the allegations of wrongdoing. He and his assistants have leveled a wide range of accusations against some of the Federal officials investigating him, asserting that they are drug dealers, Nazis or K.G.B. agents, Federal officials say.
1986-04-11	Short-Term Rates Up Slightly	Short-term interest rates rose slightly yesterday, while yields of notes and bonds fell by small amounts. Widespread anticipation that the Federal Reserve will soon make an overt move to ease monetary policy has caused interest rates to decline sharply in recent days. As a result, rates on both short- and long- term Treasury issues are very near their lowest levels of the year, and are at levels not seen since 1977. ''Given the sluggishness in the economy, it seems appropriate for the Federal Reserve to ease policy and cut the discount rate,'' said Edward J. Sawicz, a vice president at the Discount Corporation of New York, a dealer in government securities. The 7 percent discount rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions is regarded as a floor rate for the the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, a closely watched benchmark for other short-term rates.
1986-04-06	"NUMISMATICS;
A MEDAL FOR HISTORY"	"Benjamin Franklin, one of this nation's founding fathers, appears on a new medal of the United States Capitol Historical Society. The new issue, the latest in a series, bears the imprimatur of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution.

The obverse carries a contemplative portrait of Benjamin Franklin which is more compelling than the likenesses seen on the Franklin half dollar. The portrait depicts him as he looked during the mid-1780's, when he entered deliberations leading to the framing of the Constitution."
1986-04-06	"DINING OUT;
SOUTHERN ITALIAN FIRE IN SCARSDALE"	"WALKING through the preponderance of white wrought-iron bars in Anthony's curved entry makes one uneasily aware of what life in a bird cage must be like. The commodious bar area, the dining rooms's dance floor under a ceiling of mirrors, and stained-glass panels of kitsch Art Nouveau odalisque types are geared more to meeting than to eating, but felicitous service and entertainment helped make dining in this hard, bright, open space surprisingly agreeable. On weekends Al DiMarco with his electric piano belts out a sampler of the grand old tunes. Dancing is invited, although on our visits no one worked the floor.

It should be said at once that the rating reflects a single star resting just at the horizon. From the never-never land called regional, the cooking exhibits no high aspirations. However, when the kitchen lets loose with the penetrating, fiery peppers and vinegar generally associated with Italy's south, there is no question about where the chef's heart is."
1986-04-06	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Children's Items Up to 60% Off The first anniversary at The Children's Chest in Yonkers means that prices, usually set storewide at 25 percent below suggested retail, drop even further on first-quality selected items, in some cases to 60 percent off, until April 20. The children's clothes are from newborn to size 14 for both boys and girls - from christening suits and gowns and First Communion dresses to spring outerwear and bathing suits. Children's books, a slide and a scooter are on hand to alleviate the strains of shopping, plus free helium balloons for each child present.

Polycotton striped knit short-sleeved shirts by Paris III in sizes 8 to 14 and usually $15 are $3.99, and Cherokee boys' jeans in the same size range and usually $25 are $10. Boys' sizes 4 to 7 Buster Brown polycotton slacks with elasticized waistbands are 40 percent off or $4.80 in tan or gray with a white stripe, or $9 in assorted colors when by Lee. Bibo makes the fleece separates in red and royal - pants, tops and button-front cardigans."
1986-04-06	HOMERIC GREEK FARE IN MERRICK	TAKE the trendy California open kitchen plus the theatrics of a whole baby lamb and a suckling pig turning on a spit. Add the olive oil-based Mediterranean diet, and you can understand the appeal of Islands of Greece in Merrick. If this is not the very best Greek restaurant on the Island, it does not have to worry about much competition. The utilitarian storefront has been dressed up with carpeting, paintings of the Acropolis and Victorian-style light fixtures, and the tables have tablecloths. As in the typical restaurant in Greece, some of the raw ingredients, such as fresh fish and jumbo shrimp, as well as a number of the prepared dishes, are displayed near the entrance. And as in a diner, a lighted revolving display holds the desserts.
1986-04-06	SEAFOOD IN A NAUTICAL SETTING	WORD of a new restaurant in Bridgeport evokes hope in this long-declining city. That is why news of Captain's Cove Seaport, a new marina with a restaurant and shops, sparked considerable interest. We journeyed there to try the restaurant, Captain's Cove, but found what is in essence a fast-food eatery facing a pretty marina packed with boats. If you happen to be in the neighborhood, if the weather is sunny and you crave a pile of lightly fried clams, head for Captain's Cove. Place your order at the counter in this barn-like hall, and when you pick it up 10 minutes later take your plastic plate, cup and utensils and settle outdoors at one of the picnic tables overlooking the water.
1986-03-30	"DINING OUT;
MADISON: DESSERT TAKES THE CAKE"	"FIVE years ago, I chanced upon a tiny cafe in a Chatham shopping center called Joie de Vivre and reviewed it in this space. At that time, it rated one star for its simple, Americanized French food and very high marks for its cozy, unpretentious charm.

Three months ago, Joie de Vivre moved from that tour-bus-sized storefront into airy new quarters on Madison's Main Street in a building last occupied by the late, lamented Sonia Rose restaurant.

The owners, John and Dee Shoaf, have decorated the high-ceilinged dining room with comfortably spaced tables topped with tulips in bud vases, lazily turning ceiling fans and track lights pointing up the colorful, framed still-lifes on the pressed-tin walls."
1986-03-30	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Some Never Worn, Some Gently Used Instant Replay, a consignment boutique that opened 11 years ago in Harrison, has ''gently used'' women's wear from major manufacturers and designers and some never-worn items brought in by a purchaser who changed her mind once home or obtained from a retail store at the end of a season. The sportswear and dressy clothes are dramatically reduced; handbags are marked $5 or $6 to $40; evening bags begin at about $15; shoes are $15 to $28, sometimes to $39; wallets sell for $3 to $15; belts are $1 to $20; scarves are $3 to $15 and costume jewelry begins at $2.

Fall and winter wear is in short supply now and down to half the original prices here as the season's stock changes by April 8 to transitional, spring and summer wear. Recently among the coats there was just one Burberry raincoat with button-out wool lining for $149. A Robert Haik gold jacquard silk long-sleeved blouse, earlier $39, and a sequinned brown V-neck knit top by Anthony Muto, earlier $38, had each been re-marked to $5.

The $10 rack included a Gucci wine-colored raincoat in size 10, a collarless Elizabeth Arden black pinstriped wool dress earlier $65 here, and a Regency polyester navy jacket and skirt with elasticized waist in size 18 1/2. A blue velvet suit with rhinestone buttons, made by Tapemeasure and earlier $68, was also $10."
1986-03-30	WHERE SERVICE OUTSHINES FOOD	FEW restaurants on Long Island make you feel as welcome, comfortable and catered to as Emilia in Carle Place. The owners and staff go out of their way to be accommodating, and when they inquire as to whether everything is all right, it is not merely a perfunctory going through the motions. Food left on the plate is a genuine cause for concern. In one instance, when the cut of veal used for a chop was too close to the shoulder and rather sinewy, the charge was removed from the bill.
1986-03-26	NEW YORK-FLORIDA TRAIL OF A MEDICAL 'IMPOSTER'	Six months ago, Dr. Charles Hall was a low-profile advertising copywriter at a small medical products company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Today, investigators say, Dr. Hall no longer exists. Neither, they say, do any of the 30 or more other identities - all of them with authentic medical licenses - that prosecutors say were fraudulently created by a 58-year-old man now being held without bail in a jail in Dade County, Florida. The man accused of being an impostor is Theodore Levchenko, whose multiple medical identities using the names and credentials of real doctors have left a tangled web that extends from Florida, to New Jersey and New York. New York State officials say at least two, and perhaps more, of Mr. Levchenko's bogus doctors were licensed to practice medicine at the same time in New York City.

FRENCH FLAIR IN HUNT-CLUB THEME"	"NEW and well-situated in central White Plains, Le Jockey Club occupies the site of and takes its name from the old Jockey Club. Those who knew the old place will feel at home, for any change in decor is imperceptible. The theater-lobby carpeting remains, as do the trappings from the subdued hunt club theme: hunting horns, equestrian prints and polished brass against wood paneling. But, as the Francofied name suggests, these days the menu has a French accent.

While the furnishings and appointments of the dining areas are virtually complete, the kitchen still requires work. On the first of three visits, except for the desserts, the food was uniformly poor, the meats and fish without texture and flavor, as though they had been forgotten in a steamer. On the other visits a few decent offerings surfaced; however, they weren't strong or numerous enough to promote much faith in the skills of this kitchen. We wish the news were better; White Plains needs a dependable as well as beautiful restaurant. Le Jockey Club is young and may yet grow into the role."
1986-03-23	Disney World	To the Editor: Your readers should know that Visa cards are not accepted for admission or any purchases at stores or restaurants within the confines of Walt Disney World or Epcot Center. Since this announcement is not made until you are at the point of purchasing your admission tickets, the traveler who has little cash and is without either a MasterCard or an American Express card faces a time-consuming journey to a bank to get a cash advance on his or her Visa card.
1986-03-23	A COZY SPOT OFFERING LIGHT FARE	FAIRFIELD COUNTY has its share of small, informal restaurants where young professionals gather for fare that is generally light and easy to put together. One of the livelier and cozier of such places is Chadwix of Fairfield. From the outside, this looks like an unprepossessing roadhouse. Inside, the rustic, tavern atmosphere includes attractive poster-art on the walls above wood wainscotting, soft lighting, flowers and candles on the crowded-together tables and a pleasing, neighborhood ambiance. A friendly, easygoing young staff adds to the sense of comfortable informality.
1986-03-23	2 CULTURES ARE SUCCESSFUL PARTNERS	IF YOU ever doubted that it is possible to do two things at once and do both well, try the new East West Cafe in Merrick. As its name implies, it serves both Chinese and Continental food. Mixing the two cuisines at the same table can lead to some amusing confusion (only customers ordering Continental food are served bread, for example) and bizarre combinations (you can conceivably begin with lobster bisque and go on to moo shu pork or have hot and sour soup followed by veal parmigiana). But the pleasant surprise is that the food from either cuisine is very good. And except for Saturday nights, when the place is filled to capacity, the servers generally cope fairly well with the unusual demands created by the two menus.
1986-03-16	SOPHISTICATED ITALIAN IN SMITHTOWN	TO DISCOVER just how sophisticated Italian food has become, compare the menu at Casa Rustica in Smithtown with that of your local pizzeria take-out place. It's an evolution long overdue. Casa Rustica offers a broad range of dishes. Look for innovative pastas, several superb risottos and main courses that depend less on having rich sauces or cheese melted on them than on straightforward, honest country cooking. The main-course department is unfortunately mined with some specialties that do not measure up, but careful ordering can insure an enjoyable, even memorable, dinner.
1986-03-09	SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE, ALMOST	IT PROBABLY pays to be a regular at Millie's Place in Great Neck. Then you might be accustomed to the chummy familiarity of the serving staff, some of whom sit down at tables to chat with the patrons or are ready with an arrogant quip if you make a comment. And perhaps then you are not likely to mind their offhand manner of placing the food on the table with no attempt to serve around instead of across, or to know who ordered what. Millie's Place was popular the day the doors opened and now, having expanded and doubled in size with a stunning sky-lit bricked-walled installation, it seems to be doing better than ever. The varied, lengthy and trendy menu, featuring salad plates, pastas, burgers, chicken, steaks and a lengthy roster of specials such as grilled swordfish with Japanese sauce or stir-fried shrimp and vegetables, has something for everyone.
1986-03-08	FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS ITS LOAN RATE TO 8-YEAR LOW, 7%	The Federal Reserve Board cut the interest rate it charges financial institutions today by half a percentage point, to 7 percent, its lowest level in almost eight years. In turn, banks nationwide cut their prime rate half a point, to 9 percent. Economists and bankers said the drop in the prime rate, to which a broad spectrum of loans are tied, would have a powerful impact on individuals and business, as well as on debtor nations. For consumers, the benefits will show up immediately in auto and home improvement loans. Lower interest rates will also put downward pressure on mortgages. But the lower rates are expected to translate into poorer returns on such personal investments as money market funds and Government securities.
1986-03-02	A FOLKSY SPOT FOR LUNCH	THE ELMCREST in New Canaan began life as a luncheonette, a favorite gathering place of local politicians and townsfolk. A change of ownership brought changes in the type and quality of the food served. Within the past year The Elmcrest has acquired additional space and has become a full-fledged restaurant, serving lunch and dinner. There is even an outdoor setting in the rear for al fresco dining in warm weather.
1986-03-02	A CHIP NOT OFF THE OLD BLOCK	JHOOLA, in Huntington, is a branch of an Indian restaurant of the same name in Smithtown. The parent restaurant, last visited several years ago, is a particularly attractive place and could be relied upon for high quality. Now it appears that what Jhoola has to offer does not travel well. The interior of the Huntington restaurant is completely paneled in rough sawed board and batten siding, material more suited to the outside of a tool shed. It has an unfinished feel, like dining inside a giant packing crate. Dreary lighting provided in one area by incongruously ornate chandeliers left over from the prior tenant does not improve the setting. And at this time of year the only place available for storing coats is the series of bar stools near the entrance.
1986-02-23	"DINING OUT;
THE DRAWBACKS OF A 'DRY' TOWN"	"REAL-estate agents will often point out that, when buying a house, there are only three really important factors to consider: location, location and location.

The same is true for restaurants. Assuming that the food and service are good, and the prices are not out of line with similar places in the area, there should be very few problems. Even the lack of a liquor license, while it may lower the profit, in no way affects the success of a restaurant."
1986-02-23	FROM THE ORIENT, 2 CUISINES IN ONE	KOREAN-JAPANESE restaurants such as the New Kalbi House in Flushing, Queens, serve both Korean and Japanese food, not some new composite cuisine. Start with sushi, then go on to Korean barbecued beef, the way the Koreans who dine here do. Although good sushi is widely available these days and does not require a trip to Flushing, for Korean food it's a different story. Despite its unprepossessing exterior that suggests a bar and grill, the New Kalbi House provides a pleasant dining atmosphere in understated, tailored Oriental style with white walls and dark wood trim. Beyond the bright sushi bar near the entrance, a series of light wood tables with plastic wood-grain tops line the walls on either side of the fairly spacious dining room. There is another dining room up a flight of stairs. An exhaust vent is positioned over each table above the small gas barbecue grill.
1986-02-23	THE ORDERLY WORLD OF MARTIN DAVIS	THE snow was falling heavily, obscuring the glorious view of Central Park from the 42d floor of the Gulf and Western building. The pristine vista did little to cheer Martin S. Davis, the company's 58-year-old chairman. He and his wife were scheduled to leave for a week of skiing in St. Moritz, and a snowstorm could postpone what was to be his first real vacation in three years. As it turned out, luck was with Mr. Davis - his plane took off despite the weather. It was another example of how, despite momentary uncertainty, things have tended to work out Mr. Davis's way.
1986-02-22	LABOR'S CHANGING OUTLOOK: CAN UNIONS ACHIEVE A COMEBACK	Change is coming to the union movement. The question is whether the change is coming fast enough to ameliorate its sagging fortunes and is substantial enough and whether unions can find new strength in an economy and workplace that are changing profoundly, or whether the labor movement will be forced to satisfy itself with being a radically smaller, although still highly important, institution in the United States. The movement concedes problems exist and is instituting reforms. It is doing this in a remarkably open manner, as was demonstrated here at the annual winter meeting of the executive council of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations that ended today.
1986-02-16	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Discounted Furniture, Domestic and Imports T Mark Furniture Galleries was established as a furniture manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer in 1959 in a former Alexander Carpet Company building in Yonkers, but after 10 years the management decided to concentrate on discounted sales of American-made furniture, plus imports from France, Italy, Canada, Yugoslavia and the Far East.

Three galleries spread over 25,000 square feet display fully accessorized rooms in contemporary, Colonial, traditional and Oriental styles. An equivalent amount of space is devoted to the warehouse area and on that floor the Kids' Gallery suggests groupings of wood and Formica-finished young adult bedroom and study furniture useful through the scholastic years and then suitable for guests. Tags give both the suggested list prices and the T Mark charge, and floor samples or already-sold items are clearly marked. The President's Day Sale offers lowered prices on selected groups."
1986-02-16	WHERE PASTA AND PRICE ARE RIGHT	EVER so slowly, the gradual sophistication of northern Italian menus on the Island is becoming evident. Osteria La Favorita in Glen Cove, which opened a few months ago, is one example of this trend. Risotto with seafood or mushrooms, a side dish of polenta, pasta with broccoli sauce, lamb chops with garlic and rosemary, and a simple roast chicken with herbs enliven a menu that also includes a number of dishes such as baked clams, veal scaloppine with lemon and linguine with clam sauce that are as predictable as hot dogs at Coney Island. What distinguishes a menu such as this one is the sense that a dinner might more closely resemble one served in Italy than in a place that features baked ziti and veal parmesan.
1986-02-14	RESTAURANTS	THE smart little restaurant Carolina took root along the West 46th Street restaurant row three years ago just as the campfires of regional American cuisine were beginning to ignite. It was an engaging spot offering a refreshing change of pace from the old French bistros that had dominated the block for decades. It may be hard to believe in this mesquite-crazed age, but only a few years ago the concept of wood-grilled meats and fish was a novelty, at least in these environs, and Carolina did a creditable job. It's likely that we have become more fussy about this kind of cooking through increased exposure, or even more likely that Carolina has become less fussy about its cooking. Whatever, on three recent visits the food tasted rather homogenized, lacking the sharp edge that makes wood-fired barbecue so appealing.
1986-02-09	A SISHI BAR MORE THAN RAW FISH	LIKE its parent establishment, Taiko in Rockville Centre, Taiko Too in Merrick boasts one of the friendliest sushi bars on the Island. An additional appealing feature of the sushi bar at Taiko Too, where two chefs are constantly at work, is the seating arrangement. Instead of a simple counter, tables for four extend at right angles from part of the sushi bar, making accommodations for parties of two to even five far more congenial than with the usual arrangement. There are a few counter seats at one end.
1986-02-04	Market Place; K Mart Closing The Sears Gap	WILL the K Mart Corporation edge out Sears, Roebuck & Company before the 1980's end and become the nation's largest general merchandise retailer? The thought is hardly new. But the different growth rates of both companies in the year just ended appears to make the possibility more of a probability. Although neither chain has reported its full year's results, analysts believe that K Mart climbed to within $3 billion of Sears's retail volume last year. They say that Sears's retail sales remained relatively flat in 1985, at about $26.5 billion, or slightly less than the usual 68 percent of the company's total sales, which include its financial services operations. Based on the first nine months, K Mart's retail volume is expected to reach more than $23.5 billion for the year, up 7.6 percent from 1984. And in December, K Mart's sales for the first time exceeded those for Sears.
1986-02-02	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"New Togs for Toddlers And the Older Young Cottontails, a Larchmont source since 1983 for natural fiber clothing for infants and children, moved one block north on Palmer Avenue in October and added a full range of domestic and European children's shoes and girls' and boys' clothing in sizes 7 to 14. The current nearly storewide winter sale drops prices 25 to 50 percent until Feb. 22, including some gift items and selected parenting and children's books.

The Toddler University first walker - a flexible, high-top shoe - costs $34 and can be unlaced down to the toe for easy foot insertion and secured with a Velcro tab at the ankle. These are not off price and neither are the cruise lines by Wibbies - shorts sets, rompers, stretch jumpsuits, tricolor tanksuits, or the two-pocket, pull-on shorts for $11 and $12 in sizes 2 to 14 and the pastel-printed boxer shorts in the same sizes. Also new for spring are the cotton chintz floral dresses ($45 to $65) and white crinkled cotton-sheeting clamdiggers ($27 to $36) by Petit Diable.

The patterned wool sweaters by West Hill Weavers are 35 to 50 percent off and some have hats, scarves, mittens and leg warmers to match. The cotton cardigans from Fingerprints in red, black or gray and the long-sleeved all-cotton turtenecks and collared-knits by Absorba, Sun and Sand and Le Top are in the 35-percent-off category now."
1986-02-02	IN CREDIT CARDS, ALL THAT GLITTERS...	WHEN Robert J. Shalhoub set up his New York City accounting practice, he decided to pay a $250 premium for an American Express platinum card, thinking it would give his fledgling business instant prestige. Instead, he found the reaction was mixed. ''Some clients were in awe,'' he recalls, ''but others would say, 'You sucker, you're paying $250 for what?' '' The so-called ''premium cards'' offer a variety of services that may justify the fee for big spenders or frequent travelers. Mr. Shalhoub, for one, got a personalized, 24-hour toll-free travel service, customized billing privileges, check-cashing services, $500,000 of travel accident insurance and a complimentary membership in the Centurion Club, an international network of 25 private clubs. Beyond that, the platinum card confers on the holder ''unparalleled prestige worldwide,'' as the American Express Company puts it in promotional literature.
1986-02-02	CONTINENTAL, HOLD THE SURPRISES	FOR the City Lites Cafe in Plainview to evoke the atmosphere of a contemporary, stylish, big-city cafe, some redecorating would be necessary. The carpeting would have to be removed, leaving a bare floor that would cause sound to resonate more emphatically. As it is, the City Lites Cafe is too subdued and civilized, making it possible to converse without screaming. The tables are too comfortably far apart.
1986-01-30	Move Over, John Houseman	At a Congressional hearing this week, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, demonstrated that he is as concerned as every other American about interest rates on revolving credit accounts. Being careful to declare that neither he nor anyone in his family had any financial interest in the issuing bank, he held up his Mastercard and Visa cards, said he was paying only a relatively low 12.5 percent interest on the accounts and urged his colleagues and anyone else paying attention to apply for them also.
1986-01-29	FED OPPOSING CEILINGS ON CREDIT CARD RATES	The Federal Reserve Board today announced its opposition to bills pending in Congress that would set ceilings on the interest rates that may be charged by banks and other issuers of credit cards. The question has drawn the attention of Congress since some members have asserted that the rates banks pay to borrow money have declined, but the interest rates they charge to holders of such cards as Visa and Mastercard have stayed high for the most part. The Federal Reserve's position was given to a Senate banking subcommittee by one of its governors, Emmett J. Rice. He said that the board felt that ''regulatory measures can have unpredictable and unwanted consequences,'' such as the issuance of cards to fewer people by credit card companies, something that he said could make it more difficult for low-income people to get credit cards.
1986-01-27	New Sears Credit Card	Sears, Roebuck & Company's new Discover credit card made its nationwide debut last week, and company officials say they hope to have 25 million of the cards in circulation by the end of the year. It is intended to compete with such cards as American Express, Visa and Mastercard.
1986-01-22	WINE TALK	BY now, most people interested in wine - and quite a few who just like a good story - have heard about the schism in the house of Sebastiani, the California family that owns one of the largest wineries in the United States. It appears that Sam Sebastiani, 43 years old, who took over the business when the father, August, died in 1980 at the age of 66, has been deposed. His place has been taken by his younger brother, Don, at the behest of their mother, Sylvia, who is the majority stockholder in the privately held business. Mrs. Sebastiani, 69, owns 92 percent of the stock in the Sonoma winery. In the new executive shuffle, she had resigned as board chairman in favor of Don and Richard Cuneo, her son-in-law and for years, the company's chief financial officer. Sebastiani Vineyards is the eighth largest winery in California, in the company of giants such as the Gallo Winery and Seagram's Taylor California Cellars. These wineries specialize in inexpensive wine; it is a segment of the market in which competition has been fierce in recent years.
1986-01-19	WHERE INGREDIENTS GET RESPECT	THE approach to Jonathan's Bridge View in Bayside, Queens, is romantically scenic as the restaurant - in a large, green-shuttered white house trimmed with twinkling lights - comes into view along with the gracefully illuminated sweep of the Throgs Neck Bridge. It's still attractive from the parking lot, but once you are seated inside there is little of the view left. Only the yellow lights of the exit ramp remain visible from the windows. Not that the distraction is essential. The interior is comfortably plush, the walls are flattering salmon pink and each of the series of rooms cozily intimate. They cleverly open them as needed; on weekdays only one is likely to be filled. But the rigid artificial rosebuds on each table detract from the stylishness that carefully curled butter pats in a silver dish might suggest.
1986-01-12	IN EX-BANK, ITALIAN WITH INTEREST	WITHOUT the name as a clue, you would not suspect that the building now occupied by Bank Restaurant in Astoria, Queens, was indeed once a bank. But now that you know, you see that separating the bar and dining room is a framework that suggests tellers' windows. It must have been a small neighborhood branch without marble pilasters or heavy bronze doors. And the restaurant is now a pleasant neighborhood spot for dining. More arresting than any banklike feature is a map of Italy made completely out of wine corks that hangs on one wall. The dining room is bright and decorated in a comfortable manner.
1986-01-08	Sears Speeds Debut Of Discover Card	Sears, Roebuck & Company said today that it would begin marketing its Discover card nationwide on Jan. 23 and that the start-up costs of distributing the card would result in an after-tax loss of $115 million this year. The nation's largest retailer had originally said it would introduce its credit card nationwide in midspring.
1986-01-05	"DINING OUT;
NEWARK: SPANISH-CUM-PORTUGESE"	"TO FIT into the belt-tightening regime that traditionally follows the extravagances of December, a visit to one of the informal Spanish-cum-Portuguese restaurants in Newark's Ironbound section is a good bet. Bountiful seafood platters and hefty portions here are the drawing card at refreshingly reasonable prices.

A walk down Ferry Street, the neighborhood's main artery, is like a visit to another country and, even after dark, the enclave seems to be safe and bustling. Aromas of Portuguese bread waft from Coutinho's, Texeira's and Pitta's ovens; colorful greengrocers' stands and more than a score of Iberian restaurants are dotted along Ferry and the tidy, narrow side streets."
1986-01-05	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Cut Designer Wear, Free Alterations Theo and Theos, a discount men's clothing store, opened in September in New Rochelle with Italian- and French-designed casual-to-business styles and designer clothing made in the Orient, a full line of shoes for men (sizes 5 1/2 to 13), and women's shoes and boots (sizes 5 to 11). The store is patterned on the management's first venture, opened in Astoria, Queens, eight years ago, and all alterations are free and completed at the shop.

All-wool herringbone, raglan overcoats or cashmere-and-wool blends in navy, black and gray are $225; the pure cashmere coats are in light and dark camel tones and cost $250. Trench coats with removable polyester linings cost $115 and versions with quilted linings are $150; fur-collared trench coats with buttoned-in linings are $95 and unlined raincoats are $80."
1986-01-05	SCOUTING OUT BARGAINS IN CREDIT CARDS	WHEN the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company cut the interest rate on Visa and Mastercard accounts to 17.8 percent from 19.8 percent last November, new applications flooded into the bank. Charles R. Walsh, senior vice president of the bank's retail services division, received one letter from a grateful Midwesterner beginning, ''God bless you . . .'' Not everyone is as pleased as Mr. Walsh's new customer, however. Credit card rates have mostly stuck at 18 to 21 percent, despite the general trend toward lower rates. As a result, more shoppers have been searching for credit card bargains across state lines. This exodus has prompted legislation, now pending in Congress, that would help to unify card costs, pegging them to market rates.
1986-01-05	FROM CONTINENTAL TO PURE ITALIAN	LA VIOLA in Cedarhurst, which opened in 1977, was a Continental restaurant until a few months ago, when the owner, Lino Viola, decided to say adieu to the French part of the menu. Now his restaurant is thoroughly Italian haute cuisine (or alta cucina). The revision has been a successful one, an improvement. Even the decor has been lightened and brightened, with snappy, green-striped banquettes, mirrors that expand the vistas of the low-ceiling room and cream-colored walls. Only the service could still use some polish. Too many of the waiters serve across the table when there is room to go around and make no effort to deposit a dish in front of the person who ordered it. This restaurant should provide better than the typical ''who-gets-the?'' school of contemporary restaurant service.
1986-01-03	RESTAURANTS	LAST month's opening of the Ritz Cafe on Park Avenue, sister of a glittery establishment in Los Angeles, is one of the best-kept secrets around. Nearly two months old, this handsome Art Deco Cajun-Creole restaurant, on the site of the ill-fated La Coupole, is a lonely spot at night. This is curious indeed, for the Ritz Cafe has more going for it than many lesser places that were standing-room-only the first week - including some intriguing food. The dining room is a wide-open arena with a high ceiling, Art Deco chandeliers, etched-glass room dividers, period wall moldings and full-length glass panels facing 32d Street (unfortunately, they retain heat about as well as rattan). Two long mahogany bars flank the front of the room, and along the back are semiprivate booths - perfect for discreet business meetings or even trysts. A variety of shellfish samplers are offered for starters; you can have them at the bar with one of the house cocktails or in the dining room. The oysters - Apalachicolas lately - tasted overly rinsed and bland one evening, better on a second visit; Gulf shrimp with a piquant version of remoulade sauce made with peppers, tomatoes and mustard were firm and tasty; the best appetizer is crab cakes, which are loaded with meat, flavored with crunchy scallions and lightly fried.
1985-12-29	From Cupboards To Braided Wheat	The Painted Cupboard in Bedford Village is a source for antiques and modern and folk items crafted by Swedish artisans of 200 years ago, artisans working in Sweden or Swedish artisans duplicating their traditional wares in America. Some dates are discernible on the old pine and birch painted pieces, and there are well-used kitchen and farm tools - for example, a vast wheat sieve that looks like a woven basket, once priced here at $195 and now $130. A sale through mid-January affects prices on a painted bench useful for removing boots in an entryway place, down from $975 to $475, and a waist-high, painted corner cupboard, down from $1,200 to $875. Similarly ridged cupboards that can be paired one atop the other cost $625 and $775 individually, but as a pair they sell for $1,150. A tall and slender antique working clock - it has the original works and painted metal face - was $8,750 earlier and now costs $5,900. An armoire pair with original hardware and paint - the top set back and the lower cabinet with a scalloped edge -is down to $6,900 for both. Another cupboard with a whimsical painted scene on the one large door and dentiles along the edging sells for $1,500; a two-door storage piece dated 1798 sells for $850 and a turn-of-the-century hutch costs $225. An antique yarn winder costs $250 and old chairs with simple lines are $40 to $75.
1985-12-29	FRENCH FINESSE IN GREAT NECK	ONE glance at the pastries on display in the retail area of Gourmandise, a new restaurant, cafe and catering shop in Great Neck, and you could be in some arrondissement instead of on Middle Neck Road. The finesse of the French pastry maker is immediately evident. There is no other place in Nassau County where you see the same touch. Cafe tables used for serving lunch and snacks are clustered to one side of this bright, sleek shop. The dining room, up a couple of steps, looks like a garden porch, with floor-to-ceiling windows all around, the view of the parking lot masked by evergreens and a high white trellis. It is decorated in a lighthearted pink and white color scheme, with nicely subdued illumination.
1985-12-24	Security Pacific Gets PX Business	Security Pacific Bankcard USA said it had won a contract to process credit-card transactions at 791 Army and Air Force post exchanges in the United States as well as 35 Navy stores in California, Washington and Nevada. The division of the Security Pacific Corporation, the nation's seventh-largest bank holding company, did not disclose the contract's value, but a spokesman, Mary Trigg, said it would be one of largest merchant accounts at the bank.
1985-12-22	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	For Partying Times And Other Times Harris Restaurant Supply in Port Chester is both a wholesaler and a retailer at wholesale prices of commercial and home supplies for cooking, serving, partying and cleaning up afterward - everything from a corncob holder for 15 cents or a 10-inch candle for 35 cents to a Garland six-burner stove with grill, broiler, two full-size ovens and a price tag of $1,495. All sales are cash and carry - checks and credit cards cannot be accepted. Party supplies in hard and unbreakable soft plastic can be color-matched - glasses, plates, napkins, tablecloths and utensils. Holiday hats, favors and decorations are on hand as well as aprons and wrapping paper. Serving pieces in plastic can hold extra-large quantities of food and $10.75 buys a rack for both a large, rectangular aluminum food pan and the outside water pan to keep it steaming, and the Sterno warming light. Platters, plates and bowls in clear or designed plastic, or in aluminum can be filled with home-baked goods and transported without worrying about returning the containers. Reusable party coffee mugs are 10 for $1.25. Other party supplies are large jars of cherries, onions and olives, plus toothpicks, aprons and implements for bar use.
1985-12-22	A RARITY AMONG STEAKHOUSES	DAR TIFFANY, a steakhouse of unusual design, opened in Greenvale a little less than two years ago. It was a two-star steakhouse then, and several return visits recently clearly indicate that the quality has held up. It rates two stars again. What is surprising about Dar Tiffany is not that it continues to please, but that its basic, simple formula - a limited menu of straightforward specialties that depend on fine ingredients - has not been cloned. Commendable steakhouses of this type are in surprisingly short supply on the Island.
1985-12-22	FROM NEW YORK, BANKING BY PHONE	A NEW YORK CITY bank has gained a foothold in the Connecticut market with a bank-by-mail program, but the State Banking Department is considering whether the service violates interstate banking laws. The service, which offers consumers an opportunity to do all their banking by mail or telephone, was reviewed by bank attorneys and ''does not violate laws of any kind,'' according to a vice president of the bank, Chemical. Connecticut regulators, although stating the service appears to conform to statutes, have nonetheless instituted a legal review. The Acting Commissioner, Howard B. Brown, said the service was a natural offshoot of the effort to offer more innovative services.
1985-12-22	ALTERNATIVES TO RICH HOLIDAY FARE	WHEN the rich fare of the holidays becomes excessive, sometimes an Oriental meal can provide the light relief that soothes body and soul. There is news about three Oriental restaurants; in fact, make that four, since two of them, Kyoto and Szechuan East, occupy the same premises (one-half is Japanese and the other, Chinese). But more about that later. Sushi fans will be pleased to know that Benihana, the grand-daddy of Japanese steak house chains, has installed a sushi bar at its attractive Short Hills outpost. Open just a month and grandly named Rocky Aoki's Sushi Palace, it is actually a section of the lounge that has been converted into a trim, modern sushi bar lined with low chairs.
1985-12-15	WELCOME NEWS FOR HISPANOPHILES	A SPANISH restaurant in Connecticut, indeed in Norwalk, is certainly an idea whose time has come. To a Hispanophile, it is especially good news. My anticipation soared even higher when I heard the name - Meson Galicia. This meant that the emphasis would probably be on seafood, for Spain's northwestern coastal region of Galicia is famous in Spain for its fresh seafood. In fact, seafood throughout Spain is some of the world's freshest and best.
1985-12-15	SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW	MONTE CRISTO in Great River is an Italian-Continental restaurant of old-fashioned standard issue with many new ideas grafted onto it. It is overdecorated in dark wood with stained-glass lamps, bric-a-brac pinned or placed on every surface and hanging plastic plants. Imitation flowers are tucked into bud vases on each table, and ''Old Blue Eyes'' croons through the sound system. Pre-wrapped butter pats, iceberg lettuce salad and spaghetti offered as a side dish are not the details one expects when dining on elegant shrimp in a sauce made with champagne and heavy cream, or seafood mingling with strands of angel hair pasta, also in a cream sauce. But retro is chic these days, so if you dig out an old extra-wide or extra-narrow necktie or pin a 1940's rhinestone brooch to your collar, you might be in the right mood for Monte Cristo.
1985-12-08	THE ANNUAL AGONY OF SHOPPING DAYS	SOME people are so organized that they shop for Christmas all year long. Such people browse in leisurely fashion, cheerfully and methodically selecting the right gift for the right person. By the time the holiday season rolls around, their job is already done. Each year, right after Thanksgiving, I vow to become that kind of person. So much for good resolutions. I do not seem to be alone. For each lucky individual left merely with New Year's cards to address or cookies to bake, there are vast hordes of ''the rest of us'' feverishly counting final shopping days as we contemplate impossible lists of critical items, none of which are optional and most of which, of course, are no longer available. Show me a person whose lip does not quiver at the thought of this seasonal marathon of purchasing and I will show you a person who does not actually do the shopping.
1985-12-08	TRYING 120 TASTES OF TAIWAN	THE only items that might be recognized on the menu of Foliage, one of several Taiwanese restaurants in Flushing, Queens, are fried rice and wonton soup. And do not expect the fried rice to be dark and laden with soy sauce, the way it is usually served. But if you are ready to move beyond moo shu pork and orange beef, consider trying some of the specialties of Taiwan, a cuisine that is heavily dependent on fish and seafood and is more savory and fragrant than highly spiced. Some dishes on the menu, such as braised shark's fin with salted egg yolk, fish head in soybean broth or marinated jellyfish, are clearly not for everybody, but exotica such as these can easily be avoided since there are a total of 120 possibilities on the menu, plus daily specials.
1985-12-01	SOPHISTICATED REGION-HOPPING	WITHOUT striving for urban chic, Barney's in Locust Valley has achieved a higher level of sophistication in a tastefully understated country setting than most of the hard-edged, high-energy spots that have opened on the Island recently. It is neither contrived nor precious, and except that the service comes close to the vanishing point when the place is busy, it is an extremely pleasant restaurant for dining. The premises date from 1893 and have earned the name of a former owner, Barney Burnett, an individual of girth so great he was supposed to have been the heaviest fireman in Nassau County. Barney memorabilia are pinned here and there to the steel-gray wainscotted walls of the two small dining rooms and bar. But the main attraction is not this side-show stuff, it's the stylish yet honest food, a region-hopping mix with stops in the South, the Southwest, California and the Eastern Shore.
1985-12-01	COUNTRY FRENCH OF STELLAR QUALITY	CONSIDERING that Cafe du Bec Fin in Old Greenwich is one of the consistently fine restaurants in Fairfield County, it is not as widely known as it deserves to be. Yet six years after it opened, this tiny, country-French establishment continues to serve marvelous food in an effortless, low-key manner. Ownership by the chef, Harvey Edwards, probably accounts for the unflagging high quality. In a business where consistency is a problem, this is no small achievement. Several recent visits confirm that this is still the same stellar restaurant it was when it was new.
1985-11-24	URBAN CHIC, ECLECTIC TASTES	R.S. JENSEN, a new restaurant in Glenwood Landing, takes its kitchen seriously. Its chef, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., is a young man of talent. Much of his cooking, a blend of new American and Continental with a liberal dose of spicy Cajun, provides the components for a fine meal. This is a place that wants to have it all. Not only is it a restaurant but it is also a jazz club with live entertainment one evening a week. It has an oversize, busy and noisy bar that dominates the premises. And there are occasional wine tastings and wine dinners scheduled as well. The element that is missing in this multipurpose mix is an atmosphere conducive to fine dining.
1985-11-24	CAREFUL SHOPPER	A Gourmet Cornucopia At Wholesale Prices Fancifood opened early in October both on Central Park Avenue south of Ardsley Road in the Scarsdale postal area and in Rockland Plaza of Nanuet in Rockland County. Both outlets offer sampling portions of imported and domestic gourmet foods sold at 25 to 70 percent discounts off retail prices elsewhere. Frequent travelers may recognize treats enjoyed elsewhere and nontravelers can finally have a taste at home of wares from 40 countries. The lingonberry jam is from Sweden and the Bonavita white asparagus spears or mushrooms are from Taiwan. Japan is the source for Kobe sesame steak sauce from the OS-1 Steak House in Osaka - useful also for fish, poultry and vegetables - at a cost of $5.99 a bottle here. From Hungary there are hand-dipped, nonalcoholic chocolates called ''cherry liqueur'' - these definitely drip, and samplers are warned to be alert for pits - at $4.99 for a one-pound box, or seven ounces for $2.99. Chocolate occupies a sizable display area, every shade and shape and in combination with creams, nuts and gift packaging. Droste, made in Holland, offers milk, dark and double chocolate pastilles that sell for $3.49 a box; Droste bars in milk, dark and white chocolate are 99 cents. German-made Hachez chocolate is $6.99 for seven ounces and $1.39 for a taster package with one each of four varieties within.
1985-11-19	Credit Card Rate List Released	Representative Charles E. Schumer and two consumer groups released a list of the 30 banks today that they said issue credit cards at the lowest interest rates. Representative Schumer urged consumers to acquire credit cards from the 30 for holiday shopping, saying such switching might force other banks to reduce their charges. Mr. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn; the Consumer Federation of America, and the Bankcard Holders of America also contended that nine of the ten banks and stores that extend the greatest amounts of credit charge interest rates of more than 18 percent. The exception, they said, was Manufacturers Hanover.
1985-11-17	SEAFOOD IN A CONVIVIAL SETTING	EVERY town should have a Georgetown Chowder House. This tiny, convivial, minimally decorated one-room eatery fairly rocks with good spirits, especially on weekend evenings. All this in spite of - or maybe because of - crowded tables and access to the dining area via a long, narrow, scruffy bar. A first glance, at the Georgetown Chowder House might lead one to expect the minimum in culinary skills. A closer encounter, however, reveals that the stitching that holds everything together here is the good cooking that emanates from a tiny kitchen in the rear.
1985-11-17	EAST MEETS EAST IN CEDARHURST	WITH the opening of Homer's Oriental in Cedarhurst, Homer Lee's restaurant empire now extends from the eastern edge of Nassau County to the Five Towns. It includes not only Chinese but Japanese restaurants and, with this latest addition, a Chinese-Japanese combination plate. Would you like to begin with sushi and move on to orange beef? Or compare Chinese and Japanese versions of fried dumplings? This is the place. There is a culturally schizophrenic quality to it, however. When you are seated, the waitresses offer hot washcloths, Japanese style, and after the appetizers are cleared, packaged towlettes, typical of Chinese restaurants, are dropped on the table for wiping fingers.
1985-11-10	"DINING OUT;

A TRANSFORMED LOOK IN MEDFORD"	"HOUSED in a log cabin nestled in the woods in Medford, across the river from Philadelphia, Beau Rivage has been an established and popular restaurant for seven years. This fall, it took on a new look.

Gerard Gehin, the chef-owner, has just expanded the restaurant, transforming the main dining room from a country French look with cafe curtains into a slightly larger room with a sleeker, more sophisticated decor but retaining the stone fireplace and the fresh flowers and candles on each table.

Upstairs, a new room is furnished with Louis XV chairs around white-clothed tables. The restaurant now seats 110 diners, not counting the wine cellar, which has been spruced up for private parties."
1985-11-10	ECHOES OF A PIAZZA IN ROME	NAVONA, in Great Neck, has been open just a few months but seems to be enormously popular. There is a full house almost every night and up to an hour's wait for tables at peak times. But Navona offers nothing unusual, and it is difficult to explain this degree of popularity, unless it is the marvelous desserts. The dining room is pleasant, simply decorated in beige and brown and adorned with several paintings of Rome's Piazza Navona. And the service is reasonably professional. But the food, from a fairly typical northern Italian repertory, is inconsistent. Some of it is decently passable with occasionally pleasurable surprises, and a number of not so appealing ones as well. It must be the desserts.
1985-11-03	ETHNIC BOUNTY	For the adventurous diner, New York has never offered so many temptations. Where else can you eat Afghan, Czechoslovak, Ukrainian, Brazilian and French food on successive nights? New Yorkers learn at an early age that the staff of life is not necessarily a slice of white bread but also bagels and croissants, pita and poori, tacos and injera. The term ''ethnic food'' is a misnomer of sorts in this town, for our culinary experience has made ethnic eaters of us all. Like everything else, our collective taste has adapted to demographic changes - embracing new cuisines with cosmopolitan curiosity and adjusting to the loss of those that have faded. For every German konditorei lost, 10 sushi bars have opened. The classic English tavern may be a faint memory, but Thai restaurants are thriving. The old Eastern European dairy restaurants are disappearing, but the Jewish delis of New York are renowned around the world. The following is an informal and purely personal sampling of the city's ethnic bounty. The restaurants chosen may not be the biggest or the best-known in each category; they have been selected because in one way or another - food, clientele, atmosphere - they offer a genuine and agreeable experience of the culture they represent.
1985-11-01	RESTAURANTS	FROM the dynamic duo who brought you Jams, the sunny and highly successful California grill restaurant on East 79th Street, comes Bud's, subtitled ''An American Bistro.'' Jonathan Waxman, the chef, and Melvyn Masters, the soigne front man, have planted their gastronomic flag on the Upper West Side in hopes that the hungry masses foraging along Columbus Avenue will be disposed to pay $20 for roast chicken - that is, if the free-ranging bird in question has the well-toned body of an aerobics instructor, is grilled to a turn, and arrives with a heavenly batch of golden-fried onion rings. Judging from the swarms of customers that descend nightly upon Bud's, they are. This rakish newcomer to the avenue sports a leafy two-tier dining room with rattan chairs, soft lighting and hip background music. Mr. Waxman has been generally recognized as one of the first major exponents of California cooking in New York since the opening of Jams a year and a half ago. The immediate popularity of Bud's emphasizes that the essence of California cuisine - a light touch and uncompromising freshness combined with a dash of Mexican zest and a pinch of American ingenuity - has universal appeal when executed with intelligence. Haute cuisine? No. Diverting and provocative? Yes.
1985-10-30	Wards to Accept Sears Credit Card	Montgomery Ward & Company said today that its 316 retail stores in 40 states would honor Sears, Roebuck & Company's Discover Card when the new credit card is started nationally next spring. Analysts have questioned whether Sears would be able to induce its retail competitors to accept the card, but recently the Dayton-Hudson Corporation signed up to accept the card.
1985-10-27	"DINING OUT;

AN AIR OF INFORMALITY IN MIDDLESEX"	"RECOMMENDATIONS from readers led us to Middlesex, north of New Brunswick, to sample the fare at Boca. This two-year-old establishment in a nondescript little building next to the A. & P. is packed on weekends with locals watching television at the bar or dining on generous, if routine, Italian-American dishes in the two attractive rooms.

They come for the informal atmosphere, the tasty pastas and appetizers and partly, perhaps, because the area is short on engaging dining spots.

The owners, who made up the name from their own first names, have decorated the restaurant with an upbeat, not-at-all-Italianate decor in browns and beiges. On each table are pewter hurricane lamps that are purely decorative, since the lighting is so romantic that reading the menu becomes a challenge."
1985-10-27	MOGUL COOKING DONE WITH CARE	NEARLY all the Indian restaurants that have opened on Long Island in recent years are elegant affairs, and Ashoka, new to Glen Cove, is no exception. But for a couple of framed Indian prints and the tandoor oven area visible behind glass, the small, plush dining room could accommodate a restaurant of any ethnicity. The atmosphere is beautifully subdued. Lights are low, and the hammered brass of the service plates glows warmly. It is an inviting setting, made all the more so by the staff, which carries solicitousness almost to an extreme.
1985-10-20	"DINING OUT;

2 CATERER-RUN ESTABLISHMENTS"	"ALTHOUGH we try to avoid writing about restaurants we consider poor or fair, there are times when it is necessary. Usually, it is because a restaurant that was previously rated highly had deteriorated, sometimes it is because there is a new chef or owner and sometimes it is because the restaurant's advertising has been so extravagant that it seems only fair to set the record straight.

The two reviewed today are both run by caterers, and they suffer from the same basic problem: The dishes sound wonderful, but are over-complicated to the detriment of the basic ingredients.

Weathercock Farms Landmark Inn in Clinton, formerly Brunners Landmark, was acquired a few months ago by Robert and Susan Genito and its food was transformed from Swiss/German into American."
1985-10-20	WHERE BIGGER ALSO MEANS BETTER	THE good reasons to recommend La Marmite in Williston Park have become more compelling lately. Although the restaurant remains in the two-star category, if it continues along its current course a third star would not be out of reach eventually. Contradicting the general assumption that quantity is at odds with quality, La Marmite recently expanded its capacity, adding an attractive large dining room, perhaps the only new restaurant setting that has not been decorated in salmon pink. It is done in a bold floral chintz pattern, contrasting with the more subdued parlorlike dining room and the dining porch.
1985-10-20	THE LONG LINES ARE WORTH IT	HOT TOMATO'S may be the best thing to happen in New Haven since the Yale Center for British Art opened its doors a few years ago. This small restaurant has the verve, style, informality, central location and good food that make it a natural for this university town. Word spreads fast. Though less than four months old, Hot Tomato's, which takes no reservations, already has lines snaking halfway down the street at dinner time.
1985-10-13	"DINING OUT;

WEST ORANGE: A NICHE IS FILLED"	"A MODERN office building across the road from St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston is the unlikely setting for a sophisticated-looking new restaurant. The Metropolitan Cafe, which opened five months ago in the spacious ground floor of the Atkins-Kent Building, fills a niche for the kind of informal place where one can drop in for anything from a drink to an omelet to a four-course meal.

Comfortable banquettes line the perimeter of the two rooms, one of which is the glassed-in atrium along the outside of the building, and white cloths on the glossy black tables, fresh flowers, candles and piano music all add to the ambience. However, because of the atrium's hard surfaces, there is a high noise level."
1985-10-13	INNOVATIONS ON A JAPANESE MENU	DARUMA OF TOKYO has replaced Suma, but for Great Neck the bottom line remains the same: a dependable Japanese restaurant still occupies the premises. The menu at Daruma has broken some new territory. The Japanese combination plate has arrived. Like the taco-burrito-enchilada combination in a Mexican restaurant or the fried rice-egg roll-chow mein Chinese special, Daruma offers sushi and tempura on the same plate; a kushiyaki sampler of skewered beef, chicken, scallops and shrimp, and, for the surf 'n' turf crowd, a lobster and filet mignon combination. Although Japanese restaurants often list a combined sushi and sashimi assortment for those who have trouble deciding, the combination plates served at Daruma are unusual.
1985-10-13	THE HISH COST OF CREDIT CARD CREDIT	The millions of Americans who use bank credit cards might have wondered why they were not sharing in the benefits of declining interest rates over the last few years. The barometers that reflect the banks' costs, such as the interest paid on savings accounts, are at their lowest levels in four years, while the interest they charge credit card holders has remained high. Last week, Manufacturers Hanover, the country's fifth-largest issuer of credit cards, broke with the pack, reducing from 19.8 to 17.8 percent a year the interest it charges Visa and Mastercard customers on their unpaid balances. Consumer groups hope the action will encourage other banks to lower their rates, but there is evidence that it may not. ''Consumers aren't aware of the rates,'' said Alan Fox, an official of the Consumer Federation of America.
1985-10-11	RESTAURANTS	WEST SIDERS are a hardened and skeptical lot when it comes to restaurants in their neighborhood. And understandably so. Countless times they have seen a bodega or dry cleaner leveled only to resurface as a splashy new restaurant with a cute name, enigmatic menu and advance publicity touting it as the greatest boon to the area since the subway. The curious will rush in while price tags are still on the chairs, slurp a Margarita, chomp on some unidentifiable substance slathered with hot sauce, and disconsolately head home. Fooled again. It is natural, then, that the new Metropolis, a cavernous, clamorous grillerie on the site of the ill-fated DDL Foodshow on Columbus Avenue near 81st Street, faces the challenge of proving it is more than just another glorified watering hole. The setting is indeed impressive: a towering ceiling with arched skylights, lofty trees, lots of brick and polished wood and a handsome raw bar.
1985-10-10	CONCERN OVER CHARGES ON CREDIT CARDS GROWS	The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company's action on Tuesday to lower the interest it charges on its Visa and Mastercard accounts comes amid growing concern in Congress and among consumer groups about those charges. Members of Congress and consumer leaders are pressing banks to lower the interest they charge credit card users, contending that these rates have stayed high while most others, notably the prime rate on commercial loans, have come down substantially in the last four years. ''I believe in the free market, but there are times when the free market does not work, said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, noting that some Congressional sentiment in this matter is contrary to the anti-regulatory atmosphere in Washington. ''In this case, I have a feeling that everybody looks at each other, winks and doesn't reduce the rates,''
1985-10-09	HANOVER CUTS CREDIT CARD RATE	The Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest bank, said yesterday that it would lower its interest rate on credit cards and other revolving credit products to 17.8 percent, from 19.8 percent. It was the first such reduction by a major bank in four years. Manufacturers said the action was intended to attract customers from other banks. However, it was also seen in the industry as a means of heading off pressure for lower rates from consumer groups and even in Congress, where some members have complained about the gap between the interest rates charged on credit card balances and the cost of money to banks.
1985-10-07	SEARS, AT 99 PLUS, IS TAKING STOCK	When Edward A. Brennan becomes chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company on Jan. 1, he will preside over one of the nation's largest birthday parties. Next year, the nation's largest retailer marks the 100th anniversary of its founding, and Mr. Brennan has long been planning the festivities. Thus, in addition to overseeing development of Sears' new Discover credit card and keeping tabs on its $26.5 billion merchandising division, Mr. Brennan is organizing a large meeting/birthday party for 4,000 Sears managers from around the country. Although Sears has tried to keep things very quiet about the anniversary celebration, Mr. Brennan let slip a few details about it during a wide-ranging interview in the 68th floor of the Sears Tower here, which is 12 blocks north of where the chairman-elect was born 51 years ago.
1985-10-06	A CHECK-WRITING NATION IGNORES THE DEBIT CARD	TWENTY years ago, it seemed just a matter of time before a consumer of anything, from groceries to TV sets, would brandish a plastic ''debit'' card, and in seconds money would be zinging from the buyer's account to the merchant's. Such cards seemed the epitome of financial practicality. No longer would merchants need to take risks on bad checks, wait for checks to clear or for credit card companies to pay up. Consumers would not be burdened with carrying cash, nor would they face the embarrassment of an accidentally bounced check. The much ballyhooed ''checkless society'' or ''cashless society'' - depending on which buzz word was in fashion -would eliminate all the inconveniences of paying bills. It has not happened. Debit cards are gaining in popularity, but slowly. Many banks, wanting to get out from under the blizzard of paper generated by checks and credit card slips, are promoting their use. And several retailers are experimenting with them.
1985-10-06	A TABLE IN THE FRENCH PROVINCES	LA SORBONNE, a sliver of a restaurant recently added to Huntington's dining scene, is a far cry from a student cafeteria, even a French one. It is a serious place drafted along fairly traditional lines that resembles many of the comfortable little French restaurants that dot Manhattan's West Side in the theater district. It is owned by a husband and wife team, he manning the front of the house, she in the kitchen. The service is professional although occasionally inattentive when the place is busy, so that dishes are slow to be cleared. The cooking is generally quite decent and more suggestive of good home cooking than a highly polished restaurant style.
1985-09-29	STYLISH SUSHI IN EAST HAMPTON	THE latest information on Fresno Place in East Hampton is that the restaurant will remain open through the fall. The schedule has been somewhat curtailed already. It was closed on Tuesdays throughout the summer and now it is also closed on Wednesdays. It is a situation the owner is playing by ear, depending on business. It might even stay open during the winter. From the sound of it, the name suggests something trendy, Californian. Actually it is named for the lane on which it is located. But the concept, combining some Japanese specialties prepared by a sushi chef at a sushi bar with grilled fish, chicken sautees and the like, is as stylish as a goat-cheese pizza. It is a lovely, low-key restaurant for dinner on an Indian Summer weekend and beyond, even as the crowds thin. The emphasis on fresh fish makes it particularly compelling.
1985-09-29	IMAGINATIVE ITALIAN AT A FAIR PRICE	UNTIL recently, high-quality Italian restaurants in Connecticut were in no way proportionate to the number of people of Italian descent in the state. That is slowly changing. Italian restaurant cooking in Connecticut is beginning to offer the spark and sparkle of its source - Italy. The ubiquitous canned marinara sauce enshrouding overcooked pasta, syrupy-sweet veal Marsala, and thickly breaded stuffed clams are giving way to made-to-order dishes featuring fresh ingredients, imaginatively used.
1985-09-29	CREDIT CARDS BEST USED JUDICIOUSLY	CREDIT cards are not only a way of life among consumers, but an increasingly important part of the nation's financial system. At the end of 1984, 99 million Americans held more than 700 million credits cards, according to H. Spencer Nilson, author of the Nilson Report, a newsletter that follows developments in the credit-card industry. Americans transacted $300 billion worth of business with plastic. And by 1990, Mr. Nilson predicts, there will be 800 million credit cards in circulation, ringing up some $521 billion in purchases. Some - but not all - of that represents wise use of borrowed funds. Credit-card fraud and an abuse of available credit limits are frequent tales of woe among consumers. While new technologies are being developed to overcome the fraud, it remains up to consumers to plan carefully and not to get in over their heads by excessive use of credit cards.
1985-09-22	"DINING OUT;

IF COSTLY WINES ARE YOUR THING"	"LAST January, William Perretti, a car dealer, opened a restaurant in Carlstadt. A considerable amount of money was spent refurbishing the space previously occupied by a now-defunct restaurant (A Touch of Class), putting together an elaborate wine cellar and staffing what is now called Perretti's.

Although experience in the restaurant business is not a prerequisite, lack of it sometimes shows in the length of time it takes a new owner to sort out the problems that are inherent in any start-up.

Service was impossible during the first few months. The haughty maitre d'hotel and surly waiters made it a chore, rather than a pleasure, to dine at Perretti's, and the quality of the dishes that came from the kitchen was very inconsistent."
1985-09-22	ITALIAN FARE, GOOD AND PLENTY	BRING a healthy appetite to Il Cortile, a new Italian restaurant in Syosset. The portions are massive. The owner, Rosario Lanza, insists that this is not a Northern Italian restaurant but that it emphasizes home-style cooking instead. Indeed, most of the specialties are straightforward, well-seasoned preparations without a drop of cream and bathed in the restaurant's good, fresh marinara sauce. Only occasionally does a Northern Italian or continental dish show up.
1985-09-22	SCOFFLAW CREDIT	MANHATTAN parking scofflaws were offered a convenient way to pay their fines in July 1984. The New York City Transportation Department said they could begin using credit cards to get their cars out of the pound.
1985-09-15	FIRST-RATE ITALIAN IN BRANFORD	FIRST impressions can be wrong. They certainly were for us at Serino's at Short Beach in Branford. At first glance, the tiny, dimly lighted restaurant with white curtains looks like a French provincial cafe. Then, voila! The menu opens and one is faced with a compelling list of Italian, not French, choices.
1985-09-15	A PLACE FOR LOVERS -- OF GARLIC	TOLEDO, a Spanish restaurant in Great Neck, is underutilized except on Saturday evenings. Yet it offers a number of commendably prepared, assertively seasoned specialties. The dining room itself, although bright and comfortable, has an odd look, with stucco walls alternating with varnished light wood panels that have been splotched, giving them a curious leopard-printed effect. Some Spanish decorative items have been placed here and there.
1985-09-08	"DINING OUT;

RUSTIC FARE IN RANDOLPH"	"THE barnlike structure in Randolph that houses an eight-month-old restaurant called Old Timbers has been the home of a variety of eating places over the last 50 years. But, according to informants in the area, during the last decade or two, most had the reputation of being little more than ''dives.''

However, starting with an identification problem does not seem to have fazed the two young owners of the current restaurant, David Sorg of Flemington and John Apgar of Oldwick. When they bought the building, it had been empty almost two years. The previous owners had walked away leaving everything, including food on the plates and cigarette butts in the ashtrays."
1985-09-08	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"In Sportive Footwear, Discounts Up to 50% Since February, Athletic Action has been the name for the former Sneaker Circus on Mamaroneck Avenue, a White Plains franchise that moved across town four years ago to The Mall on Hamilton Avenue. Sport footwear and running clothing is always discounted by 15 percent from suggested retail prices, and selected models can be 40 or 50 percent off during special promotions. All merchandise is first quality, there are no seconds. Footwear sizes are infant to 14 men's and to 10 for women.

The ticketed prices are dropped by another 15 percent in a back-to-school sale, including Tiger, Tretorn, Saucony, K-Swiss, Mizuno, Puma and Foot-Joy wares, but for bearers of an advertising coupon distributed locally or this column that discount will become 20 percent until Sept. 24 except on the previously more dramatically reduced items. This covers all leather running shoes for men and men's and women's tennis shoes.

The at- or near-half-price footwear represents broken sizes for children and adults in jogging or basketball sneakers by Jordache, Etonic, Converse, Brooks, Adidas, Pony, Nike, Street Fighter and ProKeds. The Converse Persuader - new stock in white hightop basketball sneakers - elsewhere $39.95 and ordinarily $34 here, are $29.95, and the three-quarter height Pony basketball sneakers, elsewhere $44.95, are $27."
1985-09-08	IN SEARCH OF THE MODERN MATURE WOMAN	I NEVER would have imagined that my older years would be spent living alone. After divorcing in my 50's, I was assured by friends and relatives that the world out there was populated with women just waiting for me - an educated man, in a position of responsibility, pleasant-enough looking, a sense of humor, a culture lover. You know the type: Attractive and successful children, lots of friends, tennis, the flute, ceramics. No slacker there. They aren't out there, I found. After numerous referrals from caring friends, cocktail parties at East River lounges, letters to New York magazine personals and birding with the Appalachian Mountain Club, I discovered that the older single woman no longer needed a man to make her whole.
1985-09-08	POPULAR NEWCOMERS IN WESTPORT	WESTPORT may well hold the state record for restaurants opened within the last eight years. Alas, few survive. Fresh out of the starting gate is Onion Alley, a new eatery very much in the Westport mold - small, cosy and lively. To judge by the thriving business, it would seem to have a better than average chance of survival. A handy downtown location with a comfortable, attractive, rough pine-paneled interior with high ceiling and balcony seating, Onion Alley also has a menu pegged to the mid-1980's - small, with many light choices, suitable for a full meal or snack. Service by a young and friendly staff is on the forgetful, somewhat disorganized side, suggesting the need for a supervisor.
1985-09-08	FRENCH ELEGANCE GOES ITALIAN	LA COTE D'OR, the splendidly elegant restaurant in the Garden City Hotel, has shifted gears completely. Originally a serious French restaurant with ambitious, impeccably served food, it has now become Continental and northern Italian. Prices are on a somewhat less lofty scale than before. Last winter, before the new chef, Patrick Nitto, took over, a number of Italian specialties had been added to the menu. They were better than any of the Italian dishes being served now. Moreover, despite the fact that some of the personnel is the same, the quality of the service has fallen off, sometimes deteriorating into a comedy of errors. On the other hand, the sommelier, a young man with an earnest, low-key approach and a sound knowledge of the extremely fine, extensive cellar, may be one of the better wine stewards in the New York area.
1985-09-08	PROSPECTS	The P.P.I. Stays Put On Friday, the Government's report on the Producer Price Index - which measures changes in the prices of finished goods as they leave the factory -will show a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent for August, says John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. That is a slightly lower rate increase than the three-tenths of 1 percent for July, when there was a burst in food prices. The P.P.I. is being held down in part by the still-strong dollar, which keeps a damper on the prices of commodities that go into the products measured by the index, Mr. Paulus said. Looking ahead, he said that producer prices would rise by only 1 percent to 1.5 percent for the entire year.
1985-09-01	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Supplies and Lessons For Worldwide Crafts During 19 years in Croton-on-Hudson, The Niddy Noddy has developed a worldwide reputation for supplying the needs and wants of the textile crafts of spinning, dyeing, weaving and knitting. The yarn colors are in all gradations and provide a feast for the eyes of a newcomer, even to offering inspiration to a casual knitter, who then may get caught up in the commercial possibilities of the craft.

Two floors of the four-story house are devoted to retailing and to teaching, with the rest of the rooms devoted to stock and supplies for embroidery, needlepoint, crocheting, dyeing, quilting, rug hooking, printing on silk and other fabrics and spinning of wool from fleece. The entryway from the parking lot at first glance might seem to be a kitchen but the containers turn out to be dye pots, not food pots. The teaching is constant and patient, and in one corner or another relative newcomers work to understand new techniques before leaving the premises."
1985-09-01	COUNTRY BISTRO IN WEST CORNWALL	IT may be a while before new restaurants can catch up with the real-estate boom taking place in northwest Connecticut. A start in the right direction is Freshfields, a brand-new ''country bistro,'' as it calls itself, near the historic covered bridge in West Cornwall. Freshfields is in a clapboard building that formerly housed another restaurant, The Deck. The interior has been altered into a small, L-shaped dining room, with a craft shop upstairs, but the deck in the rear remains intact and is the place to eat in good weather. Picnic tables with yellow umbrellas as shelter against the midday sun overlook a surging stream (really the Housatonic River). The ambiance is informal and friendly, as are the young waiters and waitresses who cope capably with the demands of both indoor and outdoor dining.
1985-09-01	GREEK FARE WITH REFINEMENT	THERE is a certain elegance about Athena, a Greek restaurant that opened this season in Southampton and expects to remain in business year round. Not only does the subdued decor - walls covered in creamy beige and pastel and adorned with handsome architectural renderings - strike an extremely gracious note, but also the presentation of the food is equally attractive. The bright, often lusty flavors of traditional Greek cooking are frequently interpreted with refinement, countless little extra touches add to the appeal and there is a good selection of wines from France and Italy as well as Greece. Pita breads served from the basket and accompanied by little rosettes of herb butter provide a nibble before the serious food arrives. Water goblets have a slice of lime in them.
1985-08-30	Amoco in Deal On Bank Cards	The Amoco Oil Company and the Associates Corporation of North America said that they would offer free Visa and Mastercard accounts to more than one million members of Amoco Multicard. The new bank credit cards will be issued by Associates National Bank of Concord, Calif., an affiliate of Associates, Amoco officials said.
1985-08-29	EXECUTIVE CHANGES	* American Magnetics Corp., Sherman Oaks, Calif., which manufactures credit and debit card products and optical character recognition equipment, has elected to its board Richard M. Rosenberg, vice chairman and a director of the Crocker National Bank and chairman of Mastercard International Inc. * Choice Channel Inc., Los Angeles, a pay-television network, has appointed Jackson Baker chief operating officer and treasurer. * First Interstate Bancorp, a bank holding company with headquarters in Los Angeles, has named George E. Anderson president and chief executive of First Interstate Financial Services Inc. of Newport Beach, Calif., and A. Wayne Johnson president and chief executive of First Interstate Bancard Co. of Simi Valley, Calif.
1985-08-25	VARIED DINNER MENU IN MADISON	THERE'S nothing about Cafe Lafayette in Madison to suggest that the white clapboard 1839 building was once a church or that its one-time pastor's ghost is said to haunt the attic, atoning perhaps for the murder in 1879 of a young parishioner. By day the two dining rooms and open-air terrace are light and sunny. By night soft lighting in graceful chandeliers, well-dressed tables, comfortably upholstered chairs and accents of greenery create a cheerful backdrop for a relaxed, unhurried dining experience. The infamous Reverend Hayden is nowhere within sight or sound.
1985-08-25	HOUSE MOVES, QUALITY REMAINS	ABOUT six weeks ago, Veranda in Glen Cove moved from its pale blue, velvet-lined jewel box of a restaurant to new premises across the street. The new location, a former diner, is now unrecognizable in a conversion expanded and sheathed in fresh white siding, with a porchlike entry that actually makes the name Veranda more relevant. The interior is plushly elegant, done in the ever popular salmon pink. The bar area is paved in rosy marble, and a trio of dining rooms with upholstered walls and comfortably spaced tables are graciously luxurious. Although this is a highly professional operation that seems to have made a successful transition to a location more than triple the size of the former place, there are some rough spots. Overbooking has been a problem from time to time, and the captains seem to be harried and tense.
1985-08-21	FISH WHOLESALERS PLY RETAIL TRADE	LOBSTERS for $2.99 a pound, fresh whole bluefish for 79 cents a pound and pearly white halibut steaks for $4.99 a pound. Those were a few of the prices last week at some of the retail fish markets run by major seafood wholesalers. There are now several in the New York area, in New Jersey, Brooklyn and Manhattan. They offer wide selection, low prices and generally good quality. A consumer accustomed to typical urban storefront fish markets is likely to find a visit to North American Lobster Company in North Bergen, N.J., like stepping from a Piper Cub into a jumbo jet. This retail-wholesale and restaurant operation, on Routes 1 and 9 South a few miles from the Lincoln Tunnel, is accurately labeled a Seafood Supermarket. (There are two smaller branches, on Route 17 in Carlstadt and on Route 46 in Parsippany.) From the entryway of the gray, warehouse-style building, the doors on the right lead to the retail sales area; the doors on the left take customers into the restaurant. The interior is stylishly industrial, with tiled floors, gray walls, exposed white steel trussing overhead and, in the retail area, a serpentine expanse of display counter that runs close to 50 feet. Whole fish, fish steaks, fillets, smoked fish and shellfish, cooked or uncooked, in the shell or shucked, are displayed on ice. There is a selection of prepared dishes and salads as well.
1985-08-18	TOP HONORS TO THE PASTA DISHES	STAMFORD may have been a late bloomer as far as restaurants go, but it is making up for its slow start, with new places blossoming every time we turn around. Brand-new to the local scene is La Strada, ''the road,'' whose name seems especially appropriate, as it is located on the Boston Post Road. It is in the building formerly occupied by Rugantino's, which has moved across town. At first glance, the configuration is the same: The entrance is in the lower rear, at what seems to be the back door.
1985-08-18	AN ATMOSPHERE OF SOPHISTICATION	THE atmosphere at Cafe Royale in Syosset is enormously appealing. Contemporary, casual elegance, the hallmark of the latest in restaurant design, creates a mutlilevel dining room suffused in rosy pink with effective, well-modulated lighting and gleaming brass railings to define the areas. A handsome Art Deco bar dominates part of the room and a piano player near the front door enhances the mood with a series of cocktail tunes, adding a touch of nostalgic sophistication. Sophistication evidently seems to be the goal of the kitchen as well, but at times the chef exhibits a lack of technical expertise or creates dishes that sacrifice good food sense on the altar of fashion. An example of this was the escargots en croute, plump snails nestled in flaky puff pastry dusted with sesame seeds and served with a creamy beurre blanc sauce on the side. So far so good. Unfortunately, the dominant flavoring was Sambuca, a sweet anise liqueur. While anise is not incompatible with snails, the sweetness struck on off note.
1985-08-11	"DINING OUT;

HARMONY AND FLAIR INOSSINING"	"ONLY six months old, Cafe Keenan already exhibits the potential of growing into a superior restaurant. The harmonious, esthetic environment crossed with the kitchen's flair and its commitment to fine ingredients should, in time, flower into a vigorous hybrid. Meanwhile, there is much pleasure to be had noting its development.

The long, narrow bar yielding to the long, narrow dining room would but for an ingenious decorator command all the interest of a subway tunnel. The unwieldly dimensions, however, have been recast, magically, into a pleasing and elegant form closer to that of a silken peach and cream cocoon. Flattering light glows from both wall sconces and parallel tracks of soft spotlights, which follow the ceiling's length and serve as guides for the placement of tables and banquette beneath. The long walls bear heavy, gilt-framed mirrors that add breadth."
1985-08-11	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Prices Off on Togs For Swim, Leisure The Endless Summer opened first in Paramus, N.J., then on Central Avenue north of the Greenburgh Nature Center in the Scarsdale Park Mall in 1983 and the newest store is in The Mall at Short Hills, also in New Jersey. The Scarsdale and Paramus branches are selling women's swim and leisure wear in sizes 4 to 46 with cup sizes A to DD, with a current sale dropping prices by 25 to 40 percent until cleared. Nonsale items include previews of 1986 styles.

One white zip-front Norma Kamali unconstructed suit, originally $65 and then $39, sells for $12.99 now; a white and navy suit by Jantzen that laces both front and back, began with a $39 tag, dropped to $23.49 and then to $12.99.

An Ariel navy suit with white petal-effect bandeau top and shirred at the hip was originally $62 and is $46.50 and Gabar's rasperry and black two-piece blouson, once $50, sells for $37.50 - the matching skirt costs $22.80. An Elizabeth Stewart red tank suit with adjustable shirring at the sides and a Robby Len chevron-design tank suit with several color choices are down to $29.25 for the sale."
1985-08-11	"DINING OUT;

SEASIDE FARE, MINUS THE SAND"	"NOT far from the southernmost tip of New Jersey is a seven-mile-long beach bordered by Avalon to the north and Stone Harbor to the south.

Most of the restaurants in the area are casual, no-frills eating places with standard menus relying heavily on seafood. But for those occasions when eating with sand in your shoes palls, there are a few restaurants that offer a more varied menu served in more attractive surroundings.

We chose one in each town. Of the two, the Golden Marlin Cafe has a simpler menu and decor, but marginally better food."
1985-08-11	SUSHI JOINS THE EAST END MENU	THIS season, sushi has come to the Hamptons. Omasa in Montauk, one of three restaurants serving sushi in the resort area, offers a complete Japanese menu as well. It is the Long Island branch of a restaurant in Hartsdale, in Westchester County. The restaurant is fairly large, with dining areas paneled in light wood on two levels, the lower of which is reserved for nonsmokers. The upper-level dining area is the one with the view of the sushi bar.
1985-08-04	"DINING OUT;

'GINGERBREAD SPA BY THE SEA'"	"CAPE MAY, the ''gingerbread spa by the sea,'' has become a center for interesting dining, with a number of engaging restaurants clustered downtown a block or two from the beach. Current favorites are Restaurant Maureen, tiny Louisa's and 410 Bank Street.

The Swallows, which opened in 1983, is several blocks off the tourist track and, with its restrained atmosphere, taped classical music and individualistic cooking, is light years away from the casual eateries typical of the Shore.

Three intimate dining rooms in a Victorian house are the pretty setting for the restaurant, which was decorated by the owners, Anthony Casasanto (who is also the chef) and Barry Marron. The coziest room is the one at the back of the house, with its fireplace and low, beamed ceiling. This was part of the original 18th-century whaler's cottage, which was imposingly expanded in the 1870's."
1985-08-04	A CULINARY PASSAGE TO INDIA	A GUEST at an adjoining table at Satkar in Cedarhurst was recently overheard remarking that this was the first Indian restaurant to open on the South Shore, an accurate observation. It might be added that it is a fine first. Indian food provides something for everyone - barbecue lovers, vegetarians, aficionados of hot spices as well as those with milder tastes, and those who cannot resist a piece of delicious bread. The notion of curry, as a bright yellow all-purpose seasoning, hardly exists on the authentic Indian table.
1985-08-02	ROSE ALSO SWINGING FOR PROFITS	Now and for the next several months - timed for the dramatic pursuit, the anticipated passing and the expected publicity bonanza thereafter of Pete Rose and the career base-hit record - there is and will continue to be a merchandising extravaganza. Reaching grocery shelves across the nation will be some 12 million boxes of Wheaties with a picture on the front of the boyishly keen face and pertinacious swing of 44-year-old Pete Rose, hustler nonpareil, hitter nonpareil and eternal kid nonpareil. On television commercials for Wheaties, film clips depict Rose through his career, rapping out one of his 4,000-plus hits; diving head first into second base with hardly a hint of the grace of Greg Louganis and surfacing safe - which was the whole idea anyway - with a white uniform black with dirt from neck to knees; scaling an outfield fence to pick off a drive, and running, running, running. Leaving the grocery store or living room (where presumably the television set is) and venturing into the bookstore, one may find on a shelf there ''Pete Rose on Hitting.'' And another literary work is in the making: Daily, the author, Rose, dictates to the sportswriter, Hal Bodley, the considerable goings-on as they prepare a Pete Rose Diary. The Sporting News hopes to publish the book three days after Rose passes Ty Cobb in the record book.
1985-07-28	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"A Range of Offerings In Sound Showroom Front Row Sound in White Plains is a showroom for listening to and selecting sound equipment whether basic, install-it-yourself brand name speaker models or for contemplating more elaborate custom-designed deluxe media systems with microprocessor control. The shop has installed seven re-upholstered seats, vintage 1928, from Peekskill's Paramount Theater to enable easy listening for near and distant drummers.

The goal, according to the owner, Art Powers, is not volume, as the name might imply, but rather music from a middle distance, ''a rich sound while kept low, allowing individual orchestra instruments to be heard.'' Mr. Powers custom designs the media rooms and the remote-control audio systems.

The Art Powers-Designed Sound company began six years ago working out of the basement of the same building and through interior designers in the county, Manhattan and the Hamptons on Long Island. The company has participated for six years in the Kips Bay Boys' Club Designer Showcase for audio and video with sophisticated multiple-room remote control."
1985-07-28	CHINESE BOTH SWEET AND SOUR	SWEET is the name of a Chinese restaurant that opened this year in Port Washington. The name does not necessarily reflect on the seasoning of the food. The place also sports on menus and walls a curious logo for a Chinese restaurant: a fork and a bowl. Imagine a French restaurant with chopsticks as its symbol.
1985-07-14	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Prices Are Halved On Summer Clothing The Richard Oliver House, just off Route 22 in Bedford Village, has marked most summer clothing to half the original price and other goods to 30 percent off until July 27. The markdowns do not apply to accessories -whether belts, handbags, scarves and jewelry for women or socks, ties, multicolor cummerbunds, suspenders, walking sticks, soft luggage, shaving kits or gifts for men. Ultrasuede golf skirts remain $140 and sturdy canvas totes with zippered pockets at $23 to $31.

Among the presale prices for women's wear are $28 to $49 for summer slacks; $35 for plaid and solid colors in all-cotton camp shirts by Alpenblick and Andrew Harvey; $25 for short shorts, plain and printed, some in corduroy; $29 to $44 for longer shorts and $40 to $44 for casual skirts and full shorts for golf. Long-sleeved shirts and blouses are usually $40 to $47 and casual cotton-knit tops originally were $16 to $25, whether solids or stripes and with or without collars and sleeves, many by J.B.H. and Robert Scott."
1985-07-14	"DINNG OUT;

A TASTE OF FRANCE IN RURAL SUSSEX"	"ONE of the more pleasant aspects of writing about restaurants is the pleasure of occasionally finding the proverbial ''hole in the wall'' with wonderful food.

The year-old La Lyonnaise in Stillwater. Sussex County, is not exactly a hole in the wall. It occupies a rather ordinary house that has been made to look quite attractive with inventive decorating. However, the restaurant is in the middle of nowhere, and that, coupled with better-than-average food, qualifies it as a ''find.''"
1985-07-10	BRIEFS	Armstrong World Industries, Lancaster, Pa., said it had reached a preliminary agreement to buy Dixie Yarns Inc.'s Chatsworth, Ga., yarn spinning plant for use in producing tufted carpet. Terms were not disclosed.
1985-07-07	"DINING OUT;

A YOUNG RESTAURANT IN ROCKLAND"	"ONE of the great pleasures of dining out is the discovery of good food in unexpected places. Thus we were surprised and pleased to find, in the middle of the flats between Orangeburg and Pearl River in Rockland County, Images, a mauve and mirrored jewel box of a restaurant at the foot of a sleek tower.

Drawing its clientele from surrounding industrial centers as well as from the tower's offices, the restaurant and bar have been open for a year and a half, but only for lunch and the cocktail hour. Images now serves dinner on Fridays and Saturdays, and as soon as these performances run smoothly, it plans to add other evenings. Our conservative rating reflects the unevenness often exhibited by young restaurants; nevertheless, if the dinner act is not quite together, it's worth catching anyway when you're in the neighborhood and looking for a better than average meal in glamorous and splendidly comfortable surroundings."
1985-07-07	"DINING OUT;

A SURPRISE OR TWO IN SUMMIT"	"THE opening five months ago of Toto, a restaurant associated with Chatham's three-star Tarragon Tree, was greeted with high anticipation in Summit, the neighboring town that has been notably short on top-notch dining spots.

Toto's partners, Dennis Foy and Kevin McGotty, have transformed a former hobby shop into a sophisticated and comfortable space dominated by a large cocktail lounge with love seats and chairs arranged in conversational clusters. Some evenings, a piano player entertains, and his music carries into the convivial din of the already-packed dining room in the rear.

Toto is full of surprises. First is the menu, which is both brief and simple, mainly steakhouse fare with various cuts of beef, lobster tails and a fish special or two. This is unexpected, considering Mr. Foy's penchant for innovative nouvelle cuisine, not to mention the bad press that red meat has these days."
1985-07-07	INNOCENCE ABROAD	To the Editor: Most of what Mr. Molotsky learned applies to men. Last April my husband and I had a similar experience on a bus in Mexico City, and here is what women can learn from it. Your shoulder strap pocketbook should always be worn diagonally across the chest. Before entering the bus or Metro, swing it around in front of you. In my case, with right arm raised holding on to the bar above, my heavy leather shoulder bag was neatly slashed and wallet extracted. Had I thought of the cross-chest maneuver the theft would have been much more difficult.
1985-06-30	LITTLE THINGS ADD UP TO BIG PLUS	TWO months after it opened in Westbury last fall, Eugen's received a one-star rating. But at that time there were strong indications that it could evolve into a two-star restaurant. Recent visits have now confirmed two stars. Nothing major has been changed. But experience with a restaurant such as Eugen's suggests that it is in the multitude of small details that the quality of a restaurant rises and falls, both in terms of the food and the service. The bread and butter, the freshness of the flowers on the tables, the way the wine is presented and served, the garnishes on the plates and the amount of dressing on the salad - seemingly minor elements in comparison to the tenderness of the steak, the freshness of the fish and the accuracy of the cooking - still affect the overall impression.
1985-06-30	AMERICAN EXPRESS'S ACE IN THE HOLE	LONG Island born and Harvard bred, the new president of the American Express Company, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., bears scant resemblance to the man he replaces, Sanford I. Weill, the Brooklyn deal maker who became a sultan of Wall Street. Where the flamboyant Mr. Weill basks in the glow of media attention, Mr. Gerstner shies from the limelight. But, in his quiet way, Mr. Gerstner has during the past decade masterminded American Express's domination in credit cards, the cornerstone of this $13 billion financial services empire. From now on it will be virtually impossible for Mr. Gerstner, 43 years old, to remain in the shadows. As No. 2 at American Express, the former McKinsey & Company director will help chart the course for a company quite unlike most others: It is at once a global travel agent, a brokerage house, an insurance company and an international bank. Its green, gold and platinum credit cards are held by 20 million people and the company remains a household word for the product it invented in 1891, the traveler's check.
1985-06-23	FRENCH INTIMACY IN SMITHTOWN	WESTERN Suffolk County is becoming a corner of France, with Lafayette in Smithtown bringing to three the tally of worthwhile French restaurants within a 10-mile radius. This new establishment is off to a good start and is potentially worth two stars. Situated in an attractive converted house, it is divided into several dining rooms, giving the setting warm intimacy. The decorations are traditional, low-key and vaguely provincial, with restful pinks and grays dominating the subtle color scheme. But when will restaurant owners realize that background music is unnecessary and, when transmitted by radio complete with commercials, becomes intrusive and detracts from the atmosphere?
1985-06-16	TASTE OF COLUMBUS AVE. IN JERICHO	PARTS of the Island begin to resemble Manhattan's Columbus Avenue as stylish and casual restaurants such as the Great American Cafe in Jericho continue to open. They represent the suburban clones of the latest dining trend. A matured and upscale version of the popular ''gathering places,'' its menu goes beyond fried zucchini, burgers and flavored coffees, often emphasizing chic ingredients such as wild mushrooms and the latest regional American dishes, notably from the South and West. Grilling is popular.
1985-06-14	THE CAST OF RESTAURANTS NEARBY	Along with the blossoming of quality Off Broadway productions on Theater Row has appeared a cast of diversified restaurants and bars where you can stop for a drink or a bite before curtain time. All are moderately priced - dinner for two runs $25 to $30, including an inexpensive bottle of wine. Following is a sampling of some of the more prominent spots nearby.
1985-06-09	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Shoes for Everyone, Plus Modifications Tru-Form Shoes, established in New Rochelle in 1955 as a factory, retail store and executive offices, has a second county store along Central Avenue with a Scarsdale address and six additional stores (Manhattan, two stores in the Bronx, Garden City, L.I. Nanuet, N.Y. and Stamford, Conn.). Major sales are announced to a mailing list twice a year, sometimes with $5-off coupons on purchases of more than $20, and the sale area in each store has footwear at 30 to 50 percent off. The Manhattan shop has five workmen to fill custom-made shoe orders - the only branch to offer this service.

Two Tru-Form shoestores on wheels serve hospitals and nursing homes in the region on a regular schedule or by appointment. The trucks have 500 pairs of shoes (including orthopedic styles) and grinding wheels, heat guns and stitching machines for instant modifications. Kenneth Silverman, president of the company, periodically makes presentations of his concern's products and services to nursing-home administrators for the New York Association of Homes for the Aging. Morning appointments can be made with developmental center groups."
1985-06-09	ON THE WATERFRONT, GOOD SEAFOOD	IN response to the common complaint about the scarcity of fine seafood restaurants in a seaside region like the Hamptons, there is now the Coast Grill in the Noyack-North Sea section of Southampton Town. One of the dining rooms overlooks the docks of the Peconic Marina and Wooley Pond. The simple, shingled structure has an ample bar area. Except for some photographic reproductions of paintings, the restaurant is relatively unadorned. The porchlike windowed dining room with its view is pleasant, but the other room to the side is merely functional. Bare tables are set with paper place mats, but white cloth napkins are provided.
1985-06-09	HOMECOOKING IN A COUNTRY STORE	THERE is often a wide chasm in restaurants between elegant dining and fast foods. In Ridgefield, that gap has been filled by several small homestyle restaurants where you can eat homecooked food (or the next best thing) in unpretentious surroundings at fairly modest prices. A late blooming flower is the Ridgefield General Store Cafe, in the basement of the Ridgefield General Store. The cafe consists of 10 tables wedged into a corner of the kitchen accessories department. Quilts have been hung on the walls to give a homey touch, and the tables are neatly set, reminiscent of an old-fashioned ladies tea room. Service is tentative and slow.
1985-06-02	"DINING OUT;

A NEON DUCK IS IN THE WINDOW"	"CHAN'S Peking Duck House in Bridgewater is the third restaurant that the Chan family has opened. The first, in nearby Dunellen, burned and was recently rebuilt in a much more elaborate fashion; the second, in Livingston, opened four or five years ago. Now there is one at the Somerville Traffic Circle.

Here, Peking Duck, which traditionally requires 24 hours' notice, does not have to be ordered in advance. The idea is not new; several other restaurants now make this time-consuming dish available at a moment's notice. But Chan's went one step further."
1985-06-02	CENTER GAUGES CONSUMERS' TASTES	"AT the Greenwich Opinion Center, your opinion counts. In fact, the Center pays consumers to talk about what they like and what they do not like about products and services.

The Center, a research facility, conducts focus groups, as well as one-on-one interviews, for companies and advertising agencies that want to gather information from consumers. The Center recruits the participants, or ''respondents,'' who are selected according to certain demographic criteria, such as age, sex or income."
1985-06-02	ITALIAN WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH	DARIO Piccola Trieste, a small, bright, five-month-old restaurant in West Hempstead, is decorated with the red walls and scenic oil paintings that can be typical in Italian restaurants. But the atmosphere is distinctive in a manner unrelated to the setting. It is place where the convivial enthusiasm and attentiveness of the owner, Dario Viscovi, helps to make a meal enjoyable. Overseeing both kitchen and dining room, he tries to be on hand to assist with the ordering, describing the specials of the day in mouth-watering terms, helping his customers select what will please them and accommodating special tastes with uncommon sincerity whenever possible. If a hitch in the reservation system creates a few minutes wait for a table, he will serve a first course at the bar to mitigate the inconvenience. After the inevitable encounter with Mr. Viscovi you are more than likely to be in a positive frame of mind to enjoy your dinner. It must be one important secret of the success of this new venture.
1985-05-26	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"It's a Sweater Event, Wednesday Only Mme. Defarge Handknits, a wholesaler to boutiques and major retailers, has moved from an office building in Hartsdale to a vast loft in New Rochelle, where Wednesday only will be devoted to the clearance of 115 unshipped fall, holiday and spring sweaters in petite to medium sizes.

Because the open situation of the loft allows for no private try-on room, Dorothy Gusick and Margaret Hubert, who are the co-owners and design for Mme. Defarge, have decided that this is a ''women only'' event. All sweaters are ready-to-wear and to be sold at wholesale price or below - the price range is between $50 and $275, which can be paid in cash, or by check with two identifications, not by credit cards."
1985-05-26	CAJUN ZEST IN A CONVIVIAL SETTING	PROBABLY no food craze has swept over stoves and dining tables as fast as the current passion for Cajun cooking, based on the French-Canadian heritage of Louisiana. Americans' taste for ''hot'' was first demonstrated by the red-pepper sizzle of Sichuan cooking, then by Mexican salsas, and now is showing up in the garlic-cayenne pepper-onion seasonings of the Cajun kitchen. Another Connecticut restaurant joining the trend is The Food Chandler in Ridgefield. Although this small restaurant in a shopping center has been in business several years, it changed its emphasis a year ago. The present cafe has evolved from a gourmet food shop with just a few tables for lunch and supper. Gone now are all the display cases and gourmet foods. You can still order take-out from the deli, butthe focus now is on dining-in.
1985-05-26	BRICK WALLS AND SIMPLE DELIGHTS	NOW five years old and well-established, the Laundry, a restaurant in East Hampton that has always had the cachet of show-business backers, seems to have settled in for a long run. Many of the problems of food and service in the early days appear to have been corrected. Providing that you avoid it during the peak hours of the inevitable mid-summer weekend crush, the Laundry can now be counted on for cooking that is more plus than minus and professionally served in a stunning setting. The name derives from the fact that the premises had been a working laundry. With brick walls, a grand fireplace and soaring pitched ceilings and massive dividers faced in rough-hewn wood, it is a handsome reincarnation. A busy bar adorned with lavish flowers runs half the length of the room. The lighting is dramatically dim, perhaps too much so at some tables, with tiny votive candles not doing enough to compensate. Servers, although young, are attentive and, miraculously, have mastered the technique of figuring out who in a party of four ordered what.
1985-05-19	NOW, FOOD AT THE GOODSPEED	FOR years theatergoers attending the memorable offerings at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam have lamented the lack of equally appealing dining amenities nearby. Fortunately, with new ownership at The Gelston House, all that has changed. Now excursioners have the opportunity for a theater-cum-dining experience of the first order. The marvelous-looking Victorian building, perched on a cliff above the Connecticut River and facing the equally marvelous 19th-century theater next door, housed a restaurant of varying quality for many years. But a year ago, David Joslow, owner of The Inn at Chester and The Chart House, also in Chester, bought The Gelston House and has been turning it into a restaurant of high caliber.
1985-05-19	A STOREFRONT SERVING WITH STYLE	THE new restaurant realism, a marriage of form and function, is typified by the aptly named My Kitchen Bistro in Forest Hills, Queens. This storefront is no bigger than many a kitchen, and a good third of the space is given over to the ranges and counters, open to view, at which the cooking takes place. The room is uncluttered, done in off-white with hanging industrial lamps modulated to provide a pleasant level of illumination. Tables covered in white cloths overlaid with butcher's paper are simply set. This is one of the few restaurants that does provide a peppermill of normal size at each table so diners do not have to depend on a waiter hoisting a piece of furniture in order to season their food.
1985-05-12	"DINING OUT;

ENDEARING TOUCHES IN IRVINGTON"	WHEN complaints come in about a restaurant whose kitchen philosophy we have understood and admired, we take particular notice. If the place has any kind of reputation at all, something more serious than the chef's night off is often the cause, and re-evaluation is in order. Thus our recent visits to The Cookshop revealed ingredients decent enough, but dishes once memorable for their culinary craft and finesse seemed artless and roughhoused; and, perhaps to justify the prices (once modest enough to make the food seem a bargain, now in league with places that offer a good deal more by way of amenities and comfort), frankly burly, give-'em-their-money's-worth portions daunted even those diners brought up according to the bylaws of that diabolical invention of determined parents - the Clean Plate Club. This is not to say that a good meal can't be ordered here. Our criticism holds more disappointment that bulk has replaced grace, salt has supplanted herbs and the cook's timer sometimes runs slow.
1985-05-12	FROM THE ORIENT, LACKING SPICE	NATURALLY, you would get to Hunan Taste in Greenvale by driving, but where do you park? The parking lot of this fairly new and relentlessly busy Chinese restaurant is always full. Fortunately, there is a large shopping center lot on the opposite side of Northern Boulevard with plenty of room in the evening. It would be more comforting to assume that the restaurant is so popular in spite of the blandness of its food rather than because of it. Even requesting that the dishes printed in red on the menu be prepared very, very hot was to little avail. As a matter of fact, the food that was not intended to be spicy at all was the best.
1985-05-10	RESTAURANTS	THE restaurant tidal wave that has been rolling across Manhattan has finally lapped upon the rough and rocky shores of upper Broadway, from about 80th Street northward. La Mirabelle, a little pearl of a French restaurant ensconced in a thread-worn aristocratic hotel residence on West 86th Street, is a far cry from the splashy pastel grilleries that are becoming ubiquitous on the Upper West Side. La Mirabelle is about as chic as a pair of brown brogues, and any inquiry about mesquite would probably yield the response ''Eat lots of garlic and they won't sting you.'' The restaurant was opened nine months ago by Annick Le Douaron and Denise Vienot, two welcoming and delightful entrepreneurs who worked together at La Bonne Bouffe in midtown. They handle everything up front, while the chef, Joel Gaidon, and his nephew, Frank Rozet, run the kitchen. The tiny dining room - fewer than 20 tables - is a charming, tranquil spot in its own anachronistic way: pink and white wall panels with ornate moldings, icicle chandeliers, a little service bar on one side and simply appointed tables. You are greeted warmly by the owners and offered a cocktail or a selection from the limited wine list while perusing the short, classically oriented menu.

A SALT-AIR ATMOSPHERE"	"WITH nautical trappings enough to make us swear we smell salt and hear beating surf, Crab Shanty, landlocked though it may be, manages to convey the spirit of the waterfront. Only in its seventh year this landlubber behind tall iron gates and a screen of trees twinkling with pin lights looks crusty enough to pass for a venerable old salt.

One of a chain whose successful modus operandi includes offering frothy, exotic pastel drinks in tall glasses, a great deal of food - some of it poorly contrived - served in a great many courses and in pleasant surroundings, this restaurant attracts a loyal neighborhood clientele augmented in good weather by those who use the boat basin and yacht clubs nearby. Judging by the crowd waiting for tables on one Saturday night, the formula works."
1985-05-05	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Mail-Order Bakery Source for Stollen Linden's of Westchester began as a neighborhood bakery in Scarsdale in 1932, later moving to White Plains for 10 years. Now Linden's is in North White Plains and is still supplying brownies and five sorts of cookies to delicatessens, school cafeterias and stores, or to individuals, all at wholesale prices. Student organizations or teams can then resell the packets (one brownie or three cookies each) for fund-raising purposes.

Thirty-five years ago a mail-order department was added, and it now mails half of the 10,000 Linden's Real Stollen made each year by three retirees, who return to their lifelong work just for the holiday season. They also make the traditional German spice cakes called Pfeffernusse ($2 a pound) during November and December only. The stollen are $5.50 in the one-pound size and $10 for two pounds at the factory; the cost for the larger cake is $13 when mailed within the United States (or $2 additional for Canadian recipients). Stollen are never available at stores and the price does not appear on the boxes.

The original stollen recipe, as used by the late Alois Linden at his first patisserie in Wiesbaden, Germany, calls for ''plump raisins, toasted almonds, candied fruit and peels, creamery butter, fresh whole eggs and macaroon paste'' a paste still made, as needed, by Linden's to maintain the Old World quality."
1985-05-05	PUTTING MESQUITE ON THE MENU	IF Summerfield's Cafe in Cedarhurst does not happen to be the first restaurant on Long Island to grill meats and seafood over mesquite, it is certainly right up there among the trendsetters. This is a very good example of what is emerging as a new style of eatery, informal and lighthearted but serving serious, stylish food. Those of you who continue to load sacks of supermarket charcoal briquets in the back of a station wagon or whose outdoor grilling means turning on the gas or perhaps who have not been to California lately may be unfamiliar with the mesquite mystique. A hardwood shrub or tree that flourishes in the American Southwest and Mexico, mesquite is excellent for grilling because it burns hotter than most other fuels so it sears effectively and also imparts a distinctive charcoal flavor.
1985-04-28	Insider's Guide To Outside Dining	In a city where space is such a scarce commodity, New Yorkers find antidotes to claustrophobia wherever they can. Restaurants, particularly those with outdoor cafes, seem to have become the living room for the middle class; they offer space, comfort, attractive decor, food, drink and endless possibilities for socializing. These are some of the outdoor cafes that I particularly enjoy. SEVEN CHOICES American Festival Cafe, 20 West 50th Street (246-6699). Part of the three-restaurant complex at Rockefeller Center, the American Festival Cafe spills onto the winter skating rink area with 85 umbrella-covered tables. An outside bar, potted palms and the gushing fountain beneath the golden statue of Prometheus make for a pleasant setting.The cafe offers an all-American menu (entrees $7 to $14). Open 7:30 A.M. to 12:30 A.M. every day except Sunday, when it closes at 10 P.M. Major credit cards.
1985-04-28	IN AMAGANSETT, AN OLD RELIABLE	GORDON'S in Amagansett has become something of an institution, a successfully long-running establishment. A revisit after about five years proved that it remains a pleasant place for some reliably good food, nicely served. Regular customers should be pleased to note that the spacious storefront with its canopied bar and crystal chandelier looks the same as ever. The menu of continental specialities is virtually unchanged as well. Keeping the general tone of Gordon's as it is probably makes sense, but nevertheless it's time they dispensed with some outmoded practices such as including packaged crackers in the bread basket (along with heated French bread that hardens as it cools as if it were a brown-and-serve variety), continuing to offer peach Melba made with canned peaches and serving green mint jelly with all lamb dishes.
1985-04-28	LIVELY NEW SPOT IN SOUTH NORWALK	ONE more example of the new vitality of South Norwalk is the appearance of yet another new restaurant, Jasper's. Located on the corner of Washington and Main Streets, just below the railroad overpass, Jasper's seems to have attracted an enthusiastic clientele. Our initial dinner reservation phone call was not reassuring: He (answering phone): We don't take reservations. We: Oh, why not? He: Because we don't want to. (Click, dial tone.) To our relief, the greeting by the hostess was much more welcoming. On a busy Saturday evening we arrived at 7:30 and were told there would be a 20-minute wait. We spent the time at the ice-filled raw bar, where we were able to enjoy appetizers with our drinks. In less than 20 minutes, the smiling hostess led us to our table. Another evening, a Friday, we arrived at 6 and were seated immediately.
1985-04-26	RESTAURANTS	HUBERTS has been known as a restaurant that takes itself oh-so-seriously, the kind of place where it would be unseemly to chuckle when a waiter, speaking with the solemnity of a country pastor, describes dishes with names like scallop waltz, shrimp with smashed cucumbers and country captain chicken. Happily, these gastronomic missionaries have loosened up a bit lately, and their dedication to quality has not. In fact, they are winning more converts than ever. The handsome little step-down dining room, with its pale yellow walls, parquet floors and kind lighting, is as warm and romantic as ever. Guests are greeted by Karen Hubert, the petite, courteous owner, whose partner, Len Allison, toils in the back of the house as part of a five-man team. The waiters, with their button-down shirts and muted ties, look like moonlighting English teachers down from Choate. They are well versed in the eclectic menu, though, and fairly professional - if not always available when the room gets full.

GREEN BROOK: FROM PIZZA TO SUSHI"	"SHOGUN, the name by which the Japanese military ruler was known until the last century, is also the name of a few-months-old Japanese restaurant on Route 22 West in the Somerset County community of Green Brook. 

Shogun has replaced The Leaning Tower of Pizza, an Italian restaurant that was notable because of its resemblance to Pisa's curious gravity- resistant tower. The tower has disappeared, of course, and the building has been completely redone to incorporate a main dining room with a sushi bar and a large tatami room with low tables that compel the diner to kneel. 

Shoes have to be removed and left outside the tatami room. Unfortunately, people entering the main dining room are faced with rows of temporarily discarded shoes that may include smelly old sneakers along with chic new footware."

INN NESTLED IN THE WOODS"	"-century inn is as splendid as ever. Nestled in the woods next to a rushing stream, the archetypal Colonial house with its burnished wood paneling and glossy wide-planked floors glows with gentle light from candles set in pewter sconces and on tables. The tiny snuggery of a bar repeats the charm and makes a cozy place to sit and sip a drink.

Thus it is a pity that the kitchen in this splendid building has slipped badly. On recent visits the food was frequently dried-out with overcooking, burned or spoiled and should have been thrown away, not served."
1985-04-21	SCANDINAVIAN AND THEN SOME	THERE are good reasons, beyond the decorative leitmotif of Viking ships, for naming a new restaurant in Huntington the Great Dane. There is a nod to Scandinavia on the menu. An assortment of smorrebrod, the attractively garnished open-face Danish sandwiches, leads off the appetizer list. If you are interested in smorrebrod at lunch or dinner, your server will present samples arranged on a large platter. The sandwiches you receive are in far better shape than the display, which can look rather tired despite its plastic-wrap protection. A twist of smoked salmon and cucumber, herring on dark bread, roast beef and cheddar with squiggles of crunchy onion, and perfect shrimps strewn with dill are a few of the choices, all reasonably good.
1985-04-18	Now, 'Smart' Credit Cards	CREDIT cards used to be simple. First, there was just the plain, plastic card, embossed with a number. Then came the magnetic strip, three tracks of encoded data that identify the cardholder, speed credit approvals and make it possible to get cash from a teller machine. Now, in a reversal of the usual flow of technology between the United States and Europe, American companies are starting to toy with the French-designed ''smart card,'' the credit card bearing an embedded microprocessor. Rather than run the card through a computer, designers decided that they would put the computer inside the card - jammed with everything from a digital portrait of the card user's signature to a credit limit and a record of the card's last 200 transactions.
1985-04-17	NORTHWEST'S NEW-FOUND RICHES: ITS OWN FINE FOOD	THANKS to a new-found abundance of fresh local ingredients and the popularity of what is fast becoming a uniquely American style of cooking, the Northwest is now enjoying a food renaissance - and this lush green city is the focal point. What is surprising is that the renaissance was so long in coming. Blessed with a moderate climate, plenty of rain, fertile soil and a long coastline, western Washington is tailor-made to produce the kinds of raw ingredients - fruits, vegetables, dairy products and seafood - that cooks dream about. Many of these ingredients have long been grown on small, often out-of-the-way farms, but until recently no one seemed interested in them except the farmers' neighbors. In the last few years, however, the ranks of young chefs who place a premium on local produce have grown. So while many farmers and fishermen continue to struggle at their livelihood, those in this area have an expanding market for their products. In many instances they have been encouraged to expand their varieties.

THE PASTA PARADE IS STILL GROWING"	"NEIL SIMON is supposed to have said that there are two universal laws: the Law of Gravity and Everybody Likes Italian Food. 

The latter certainly appears to be the case in New Jersey, for keeping track of the Italian restaurant scene in the state is a full-time job. A recent arrival in the pasta parade is Il Capriccio, a plus 4-month-old restaurant in Whippany, near Morristown.

The owner is Antonio Grande, who comes from Calabria and spent many years cooking aboard such ocean liners as the Leonardo da Vinci and the Michelangelo."

BAKERY AND A RESTAURANT IN ONE"	"CLOSED five months for kitchen renovation, it is now business as usual at Kaffee Bazar. We report with pleasure that the bakery has emerged better than ever. With few exceptions, the cakes and pastries Manfred Hirz produces serve as testimonials to Vienna's unwavering reputation for finely wrought confections. But the cafe has changed, and although it retains some of the traditions of that venerable institution the Viennese kaffeehaus, it has recently taken on modern characteristics, diminishing the Old World charm that made Kaffee Bazar in Armonk such an unusual eating spot.

For one thing, the menu has undergone major surgery. Once offering more than a dozen tempting-sounding variations on a cup of coffee, it now lists a familiar few. For another, Kaffee Bazar has become more a restaurant than a coffeehouse, offering full lunch and dinner service, although one still might, we suppose, order soup and appetizer for a light meal or stop in after dinner for coffee and pastry. And finally the newspapers and magazines that were so hospitably available - inviting lingering - have been removed."
1985-04-14	CLASSIC, INNOVATIVE, COMMENDABLE	LA MASCOTTE in Commack has matured and is now, reliably, one of the finer restaurants on the Island. The service is carefully correct yet unpretentious, the wine list is serious, and many of the dishes on an updated menu that balances the innovative and the classic are commendably prepared. Adding to these attributes is the affordable luxury of dining at La Mascotte. The interior of the restaurant has the look and feel of a provincial inn even though, instead of gardens, the premises are surrounded by a parking field and heavily trafficked intersections. Tables are comfortable yet squeezed into relatively limited space, expanded somewhat by setting a few of them in the bar area. Reservations, which are difficult to obtain unless made many days in advance, are confirmed, reconfirmed and, above all, strictly honored.
1985-04-14	COZY CHARM IN NEW LONDON	IT isn't just local residents who have reason to celebrate the opening of Bulkeley House, a new restaurant in a beautifully restored 1790 house in New London that once belonged to a sea captain. Travelers along Interstate 95 and tourists visiting nearby Mystic Seaport now can lift their spirits and appease their hunger in congenial surroundings. The owner, Brian Beckwith, should be praised for his careful restoration. The main dining area - three cozy, upstairs rooms - was the original house, and its exposed beams, uneven floor boards and brick outer walls are intact, giving the diner a feeling of authentichistoric charm. On the ground floor is a lively pub, with tables along the sides where meals are also served. For dinner the quieter ambiance of upstairs is preferable, especially on Saturday evenings when there is live chamber music. Adjoining the rear of the pub is the former brick ice house, now converted into another watering hole, the Ice House Pub.

SEAFOOD IN A COUNTRY SETTING"	NEW ZEALAND mussels, scallops from Nantucket, raspberries in December, Malpeque and Golden Mantle oysters - these are only a few of the enhancements that gild the platters at one of the county's new and notable restaurants. Open since last December, A Country Place has taken over the 1875 farmhouse of ungainly charm last occupied by Ardo's and The Vineyard. The red flocked wallpaper of this restaurant's several past lives has been replaced with a backdrop of Hunter green, and more important changes have occurred in the kitchen. While the farmhouse may be a relic, the restaurant's cooking philosophy espouses the best of today's culinary trends - basic ingredients of high quality, light sauces, reasonable invention - brought, for the most part, to their logical conclusion by the chef, Davis Barnes, whom many may remember from Covington in Armonk.
1985-04-07	SINPLE FARE WITH A VIEW	IT is not without a touch of wonderment that your ma^itre d'h^otel or waiter informs you that Charlotte's Hidden Pond restaurant in Wainscott has been open all winter, seven days a week, for lunch and dinner, and that, yes, they have been busy indeed. In an area where the general practice is to cut back to a weekend schedule, if not to close entirely during the winter months, Charlotte's, which opened very late in the season last year, seems to dispute the conventional wisdom. It is a pretty place with dining rooms that offer a cozy fire or a floodlighted view of an inlet of Georgica Pond, sometimes with a pair of blue herons in attendance. The muted wall lights provide minimal illumination, and votive candles on the tables do not contribute substantially more. You may have some difficulty determining the accuracy with which your steak has been broiled but, fortunately, they seem to get it right.
1985-04-07	SEAFOOD IN A CHEERFUL ATMOSPHERE	THERE probably is not a town in Connecticut that has changed with as much velocity as Chester has in the last five years. The addition of two theaters, Goodspeed- at-Chester and the National Theater of the Deaf, has added impetus to an already fast-changing scene. With theaters come restaurants. One of the newer efforts is Fiddlers Seafood Restaurant, formerly the Chester Breakfast Works. As Fiddlers, the decor has been made more attractive with cafe curtains, stenciled designs around the cream-colored walls and soft lighting at dinner.
1985-04-05	A touch of Paris on West 12th St.	ANYONE who has spent time strolling through the sidestreets of Paris, ducking into restaurants or bistros that appear inviting - perhaps the name is intriguing, or the ornate 18th-century facade is irresistible - will feel a twinge of nostalgia upon encountering Au Troquet, an enchanting little restaurant in the West Village. Everything about this 18- month-old establishment evokes France - the lettered awning shielding white-framed windows with gauzy curtains, the small bar where handsome young waiters flirt with a pair of neighborhood girls who have stopped in for a drink, the simple and lovingly arranged dining room highlighted with paintings by the owner, and the sincere feeling of hospitality, not a well-rehearsed ''Good evening, I'm Reginald your waiter and we will be dining together tonight'' type of welcome, but the kind conveyed by a warm smile and a bottle of cool white wine. Fran,cois le Morzellec, former ma^itre d'h^otel at Le Relais, runs Au Troquet (the name means ''little cafe'') with his 21-year-old-son, Marc. The small menu, which changes every few months, is contemporary but not flashy, colorful but not contrived. And prices are quite reasonable; a couple can have a three-course dinner, including a $10 bottle of wine, for about $60.

CLUB-LIKE AIR IN ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS"	"''OH, IT'S a mixed bag.'' This was the reply I got when I telephoned Eton's, the luxurious new restaurant in Englewood Cliffs, to ask what kind of food we would find there. As it turns out, the gentleman on the telephone was spot on; the fare at Eton's ranges from Italian oreganatas to swinging-singles' potato skins to steakhouse staples. 

 Opened four months ago on the site of the old Opera restaurant by Kenneth Byer, who also owns The Bicycle Club nearby, the two downstairs dining rooms and bar have been transformed from their former Italianate red plush into a handsome and comfortable club-like space. Oak paneling, English hunting prints and leather demi-wing chairs at several of the handsomely set tables lend a substantial, masculine tone."
1985-03-31	HONEST ITALIAN WORTH THE WAIT	AN unprepossessing exterior and a large, dim bar area open into the bright and busy dining room of Ponticello in Astoria, Queens. It is an unpretentious restaurant of modest size that has built a loyal following. Even with a reservation on a weekday evening, a 10- to 15-minute wait for a table is typical. Seating is essentially on a first-come, first-served basis. On weekends, the wait can stretch to 45 minutes or longer. But the honest, well-prepared food is worth the wait.
1985-03-31	STILL A THREE-STAR EXPERIENCE	CONSIDERING the vagaries of the restaurant business, it is gratifying to find that a restaurant that opened in 1979 to triumphant praise is maintaining the same high quality six years later. Such is the case with Fine Bouche in Centerbrook. One probably should not be surprised. After all, this is a small, chef-owned restaurant, where consistency is maintained on a day-to-day basis. Steven Wilkinson continues to demonstrate that he is one of the premiere chefs in Connecticut.
1985-03-24	TRATTORIA IN THE FAMILY STYLE	DINING out does not always mean getting dressed up for a special occasion. Sometimes the most satisfying dining experiences occur when you go out for a bite to eat before a movie or simply want to get out of the house. Maria's Trattoria isnot a dress-up kind of place. But if it continues as it has in the year that it has been open, it will satisfy a need for a restaurant where you can enjoy a delicious home-cooked meal, without fuss or pretensions, and leave feeling your money was well spent.
1985-03-21	4 MEN INDICTED BY GRAND JURY ON S.I. IN CREDIT CARD SCHEME	Four men have been indicted by a grand jury on Staten Island on charges that they fabricated bogus credit cards, sold some and bought thousands of dollars worth of merchandise with the rest, the authorities announced yesterday. Among the items that the suspects were accused of buying with the bogus cards was a computer and printer, which they then used to print counterfeit identifications, such as driver's licenses, which they could display to merchants as a backup for the false credit cards. According to William L. Murphy, the Staten Island District Attorney, the four men were able to obtain blank American Express, Visa International and Mastercard International cards and used an embossing machine to print legitimate names and numbers on the cards.
1985-03-17	STYLE TAKES THE SPOTLIGHT	SAVVY style is everything at the West End Cafe in Carle Place. It has dictated the setting, which cleverly blends high tech and Art Deco, and determined the free-wheeling menu, with choices from Buffalo chicken wings and pizza to steak au poivre. Your glass can be filled with a white zinfandel, a fine California cabernet sauvignon, a sophisticated Bellini (champagne and peach juice) or, for those just celebrating legal coming of age, a liqueur-spiked ice cream cooler. The place shines like an up-to-the-minute beacon in the corner of a somewhat dreary shopping center location, with brass-trimmed oak cafe doors, curved glass brick entry, handsome pilaster-like wood trim and industrial metalwork trussing the soaring ceiling. Background music, much of it cool jazz, drifts from the carefully modulated sound system. The lighting is excellent and the atmosphere delightfully upbeat, striking a perfect note of smart informality.

OUT-OF-THE-ORDINARY ITALIAN FARE"	"IF you are searching for an Italian restaurant

 that serves clams casino, shrimp cocktail and

fettuccine Alfredo and veal Parmigana look

elsewhere, for you will not find them at Il Cigno. And that is a good thing. It is about time that the county had a bit of what Manhattan has been sampling these last few years, and Il Cigno's chef and co-owner Stephen DePietro has devised a menu listing Italian dishes that are at once traditional yet refreshingly unfamiliar. 

Open since last October on the spot once occupied by Vesuvio, this family operation has proved to be happy replacement. Those who remember Vesuvio might not recognize the place. Against deep pink walls, trendy prints of Art Deco pastel pink and gray jars and flowers look like something out of old Vogue. Just beyond an awkwardly narrow entry, a sparkling bar is well-separated from the dining area by a smoked-glass wall. Pink- stemmed wine and water goblets pick up the color scheme that stops abruptly at midwall, where a brick facade continues to the floor. Although appropriate for the volcano, the brick doesn't suit the sleeker looks of the swan. Formal, helpful and energetic service from a charming crew that is obviously proud of the place together with well-appointed tables and mellow lighting make the restaurant a little special."
1985-03-10	SLEEK SETTING FOR ITALIAN CUISINE	EVER so gradually, Italian restaurants are becoming trendy, and as new places open they begin to look more like Palazzo in Massapequa Park than those cliches decorated with flocked red wallpaper and paintings of gondolas. Palazzo's setting is sleek, tasteful and imaginative. The long, rather narrow room is suffused with rose pink, the restaurant color of the moment, done in wide incised horizontal bands. One section of the room is elevated and set off by gleaming metal railings, another of the latest in accents. Subdued gray carpeting, an eye-level swath of mirror and soft lighting from overhead industrial spots complete the simple, effective design. Instead of flowers, each table sports a tiny pink pineapple plant in a glass flask for an exotically color-coordinated touch.
1985-03-10	CHINESE WITH A WELCOME TWIST	-food mania continues to spread. A late-blooming example is the two-month old restaurant North China in Brookfield. North China, as its name suggests, features a number of Peking dishes. It also has on its ample menu Sichuan, Hunan and Cantonese dishes, many of them the current favorites of Chinese restaurants all over southwestern Connecticut.
1985-03-09	MARYLAND BANKS ASSAIL ACCORD WITH CITICORP	An agreement between Gov. Harry Hughes of Maryland and Citicorp that would permit the nation's largest banking institution to participate in all aspects of the state's banking business drew vigorous opposition today from Maryland bankers. Members of the Maryland Legislature expressed shock and anger at the agreement, which they learned about when it was announced on Thursday. The proposal would expose Maryland banks to head-to-head competition from a major New York City bank. The agreement attracted widespread interest in the banking industry because, if it wins legislative approval, it would permit Citibank to take another giant step toward its stated goal of being a bank with offices in all parts of the United States.
1985-03-09	NEW WAY TO USE BANK CARD	MILLIONS of bank customers in the New York metropolitan area who use credit cards and bank cards to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines were offered a new convenience this week: They can now use hundreds of additional teller machines operated by banks where they have no accounts. Beginning Thursday, people with cards from Chemical Bank, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the Marine Midland Bank, the Bank of New York, Barclays Bank of New York and the Union Trust Company of Stamford, Conn., were allowed to use any of the six banks' 800 automatic teller machines. In the coming weeks, customers at the National Westminster Bank and Goldome will be able to use the new system, called the New York Cash Exchange, or N.Y.C.E. More than 75 other banks in New Jersey, Connecticut and New York, including Chase Manhattan, have said they plan to join as well. Citibank, with about 635 machines at 249 locations, more than any other bank in the area, chose not to join, N.Y.C.E. officials said.
1985-03-07	BIG NEW YORK BANKS LINK TELLER MACHINES	A group of some of the largest banks in the New York area said yesterday that they had joined in a three- state network that will allow millions of customers to use automated teller machines of any member bank. Known as the New York Cash Exchange, or N.Y.C.E., the system initially permits customers of five New York banks - Chemical Bank, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, Marine Midland Bank, The Bank of New York and Barclays Bank of New York - as well as the Union Trust Company, based in Stamford, Conn., to make cash withdrawals and balance inquiries at any of the group's automated teller machines. For customers of those banks, the service is available today. The National Westminster Bank U.S.A. and Goldome customers will gain access to the network within the next few weeks. More than 75 other banks in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, including the Chase Manhattan Bank, have signed letters of intent to join the group, said Leonard E. Malkin, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover who serves as chairman of N.Y.C.E. All banks in the region are permitted to join, he added.
1985-03-03	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Busy Butcher Serves Meats Around County Trim-Rite Meats, opened seven years ago in Elmsford, custom cuts American prime beef fore- and hindquarters, or lamb and pork, and stores the double freezer-wrapped, frozen parcels at no extra charge until asked for by the buyer. The inventory list can be added to, or additional free deliveries made and paid for when received, on the basis of bimonthly fliers with specials and promotions sent to a mailing list of 2,000, or from the pick-up room's blackboard of weekly promotions.

Actually the frozen inventory also accommodates tastes for poultry and game birds; smoked or canned ham; bacon and prepackaged kosher beef frankfurters; hot or sweet Italian pork sausages and link sausages; breaded shrimp and fish sticks and baked stuffed clams on the half shell; fillet of haddock or sole; bay scallops by the gallon, shrimp in five-pound lots; fish cakes and French fried potatoes; French bread pizza, a dozen vegetables and four kinds of frozen fruit concentrate."
1985-03-03	Movies on Credit	It seemed to be a natural: the use of credit cards to buy movie tickets from a machine. American Multicinema Inc., one of the country's biggest movie chains, installed such a setup at its Prestonwood 5 theater in Dallas almost a year ago.
1985-03-03	PREDATING THE MEXICAN FOOD FAD	IN Huntington, in the heart of Mexican chain restaurant territory, there is Pancho Villa, a place that predates by several years the Mexican food fad as we know it today. Pancho Villa, under the same ownership as only one other restaurant by that name in Manhattan, has been going strong since 1976. It is large and pleasantly informal, with terra cotta tile floors, ceramic tile tabletops, brick and stucco walls and menus inside reprints of newspaper front pages from 1916 headlining the activities of none other than Pancho Villa himself. These provide diverting reading - especially the dispatches from the World War I fronts - if your dinner companions are too busy munching tortilla chips and salsa and are not up to lively conversation.
1985-03-03	GOOD ITALIAN AT A REASONABLE PRICE	FOR those who have given up on finding a Fairfield County restaurant featuring home cooking at prices that make it possible for an entire family to dine out, there is hope. Anacapri more than fulfills both requirements. A family-run establishment, Anacapri is small, cosy and attractive. Its wood-paneled walls counterpoint well-napped tables with fresh tulips on each. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, a pianist provides a sparkling backdrop for dining.
1985-03-02	A NEW TYPE OF CREDIT CARD	-purpose credit cards issued by retailers and oil companies, beginning in the early 1900's. Then more than three decades ago the mulipurpose cards burst on the scene, as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Diners' Club brought greater credit convenience to millions in buying a wide variety of goods and services. Now another generation of single-purpose cards has arisen to meet different consumer needs and wants. Such credit cards - currently being issued by manufacturers of consumer products, shopping centers and health services - are attracting increasing numbers of card holders who desire an alternative source of credit that is easily obtained and perhaps carries a bit of prestige as well.
1985-02-24	"DINING OUT;

A FRENCH CONNECTION IN WARREN"	"LE CHRISTOPHE, in the Somerset County community of Warren, is the latest in the wave of interesting new restaurants to open in New Jersey. Owned by French- born Michel and Yolande Cocordans, and named for their 2-year-old son, Christophe, the 7-month- old French restaurant has already attracted a following among those who appreciate good food and can afford to indulge their taste.

 The Cocordans formerly owned a restaurant in Greenwich Village called A Bientot du Soir, which was apparently successful enough to enable them to buy and renovate the building that used to be known as The Warrenville Inn. 

Le Christophe's large dining area is attractively decorated with antique French furniture, which, along with the beamed ceiling and mat-tile floor, gives the restaurant the air of a French country inn. However, despite the pretty fabric curtains, which absorb some of the sound, all of those hard surfaces make the restaurant incredibly noisy."
1985-02-24	SUSHI AT A REASONABLE PRICE	WHEN the Japanese restaurant Sakura in Westport was new two and a half years ago, it consisted of two dining concepts: a traditional restaurant with several private tatami-mat rooms, and in a separate section, a Japanese steakhouse with numerous tabletop grills. Since then Sakura has added a a sushi bar. Considering that a mere handful of sushi bars are to be found in Fairfield County, it seems appropriate to review Sakura's sushi bar as a separate entity. One is first aware of the steakhouse when you enter the building because the heavy smell of cooking oil dominates. The sushi bar at Sakura is almost literally behind the regular bar. It is possible, and a good deal more comfortable, to inspect the raw seafood offerings at the sushi bar and then repair to one of the small, regular dining rooms for a sushi lunch or dinner. If you request it, your waitress will bring you a small chart of sushi specialties, identifying the various ingredients and fish by their Japanese names. It makes ordering simpler.
1985-02-24	DOWNSTAIRS: A SOUTHERN ACCENT	THE less formal of the two restaurants at Sarsfield's in Rockville Centre is called the Grill and Oyster Bar, although a variety of oysters is not available and only a couple of dishes are even prepared with them. Relatively little of the food is actually grilled. (The more elaborate restaurant at Sarsfield's, the Escoffier Room upstairs, was reviewed last week.) Like the Escoffier Room, the Grill and Oyster Bar has also been designed with soaring, canted windows framed with sparkling pinpoint lights to create a greenhouse effect. A brick wall and, beyond, the kitchen grill area, visible through an open arch, strike a note of contemporary, stylish informality.
1985-02-21	Sears to Broaden Credit Card	"Sears, Roebuck & Company today announced plans to introduce a combined credit and financial services card in pilot markets by the end of the year. 

 Sears said the card ''will be accepted by a wide range of retail, travel, entertainment and service providers, including Sears retail and catalogue stores.''

The company said it already had a base of 28 million active credit accounts in its merchandise group."
1985-02-17	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"All First Quality And Discounted Merri Jean was established near Gun Hill Road in The Bronx 18 years ago and added a second shop under the same name last September on Central Park Avenue (where Scarsdale meets the town of Greenburgh) with discounted first-quality women's clothes from cruisewear to coats, from major designers and manufacturers.

The first markdown on new merchandise is 20 percent off suggested list prices, with seasonal adjustments lowering those charges by another 20 to 40 percent. The sizes are 3-4 to 20, with some petites and some women's sizes 32 to 44.

Discounted pink separates of linen and acrylic with cotton-knit insets for winter vacations are by Evan-Picone, which also makes bulky-look ribbon knits and handmade white cotton vests in petite sizes. I. B. Diffusion makes a light sweater with a black anchor stitched on white knit and natural linen horizontal bands that sells for $69.75 here; a white-knit sweater with pale lavender, gray and yellow flowers for $49.75; and collage- effect sweaters evoking Sorrento or Capri for $78.75. Bonnie and Bill make a pale-yellow knit with V-neck back and front outlined in linen for $39.75."
1985-02-17	"DINING OUT;

ON RINGING IN THE YEAR OF THE OX"	"THE Chinese New Year is upon us and, short of joining a parade, what better way to ring in the Year of the Ox than to visit a Chinese restaurant? At some of the Chinese restaurants around the state, patrons can telephone ahead to arrange a festive banquet of specially prepared dishes.

 One of those that is most accommodating is Mrs. Chow, a year-old establishment in Rocky Hill, on the outskirts of Princeton. While many of the dishes here will not set off fireworks, a handful of them, especially off-menu specials, are standouts.

The restaurant's casual dining room is decorated simply with calico cafe curtains, fresh flowers, a few discreet Chinese prints on the walls and, at dinner time, white cloths on the tables."
1985-02-17	UPSTAIRS: ELABORATE, EVEN BAROQUE	SARSFIELD'S in Rockville Centre is an unusual establishment, two separate restaurants with different menus under one roof. Upstairs is the formal Escoffier Room, the subject of this review. The restaurant on the ground level is the more casual Grill and Oyster Bar, to be covered next week. Sarsfield's Escoffier Room is multilevel, with one area framed by soaring windows, a greenhouse for people with a view of the Long Island Rail Road. In another section, the focus is a fireplace. Seating is plushly comfortable, tables are properly set, acoustics are fine and rows of pinpoint lighting around the windows as well as trimming the trees just outside add a festive note. Service is reasonably professional and solicitous, just avoiding an air of pretension.
1985-02-10	RISOTTO AND MORE FROM NORTH ITALY	THERE is usually a fire going in the brick fireplace near the reception area at Savini, a fairly new northern Italian restaurant in Great Neck. It is an inviting touch at this time of year. The handsome dark brown dining room with its grand chandeliers was formerly the location of several other establishments, most recently a place called Rene. Under the present ownership, the decor has remained unchanged, a felicitous decision since the setting is distinctive and attractive. Unfortunately, on one occasion the flowers on the tables were also unchanged from what may have been days before and were decidedly wilted.
1985-01-27	"DINING OUT ;

IMAGINATIVE TOUCH IN PRINCETON"	"THE Princeton architect who first recommended Roberta's to me did so with the comment that the restaurant was the way she imagined Chez Panisse (a restaurant in Berkeley, Calif., that is considered by many to be the most innovative and interesting one in the United States) would be. 

 Roberta Churchill, the chef-owner of this new restaurant in the Princeton Shopping Center and also the owner of a local take-out store called La Cuisine, is not exactly Alice Waters (the owner of Chez Panisse), but they do have some things in common. Both have the imagination to use fresh American ingredients in ways that others may not have thought of, and they also draw on all the cuisines in the world for their inspirations. 

Roberta's is basically a storefront that is simply but attractively decorated in black, gray and white. It has no liquor license, but wines are handled properly (there is a $2 corkage fee for each bottle brought in)."
1985-01-27	CONSISTENT WINNER IN GREENWICH	AS restaurants in Fairfield County go, Boodle's, at 14 years, is well into middle age. Even so, the Greenwich restaurant retains a youthful spirit and sense of excitement that continues to make it a fun place to be. This is achieved partly by its informal, bustling ambiance, partly by its coterie of faithful fans, and partly by its consistent performance through the years. You know you can count on Boodle's for good food and service - not as commonplace a circumstance as one might think.
1985-01-27	A MORE ELABORATE MENU	SAN REMO in Westbury has been under new management for a number of months, a change that has affected the menu but not the decor. The restaurant still consists of three small dining rooms, the vista expanded by one mirrored wall and the use of simple, neutral off-white and beige tones. The lighting is fairly bright without being glaring, and at the lunch the room is pleasantly daylit, thanks to several skylights. Tables are formally set. The menu has become more elaborate, with many dishes that list what seems to be the maximum possible number of ingredients. But like a person who wears too many accessories, these complicated creations give the impression of fussiness rather than style. The cooking is, in general, fairly competent; service is somewhat less so. While the captains have a polished air about them, finishing the cooking of certain dishes at tableside, they make no effort to master the basic art of delivering the dish to the person who ordered it.
1985-01-20	BIBLICAL NAME AND JAPANESE FOOD	AS Japanese restaurants go, Naomi in Great Neck is somewhat unusual. First, the name, according to the owners, is that of the Old Testament figure, which they selected because they felt the people of Great Neck would appreciate it. They added that since the pronunciation and the meaning of the name is the same in Japanese as in English, it would also be easier. And in the large room, to which some Japanese decorations have been combined with Western turn-of-the-century holdovers from a prior tenant, the tables are covered with white cloths, an odd feature for a Japanese restaurant. Although the atmosphere is therefore more elegant and formal, the many dipping sauces that accompany Japanese specialties tend to drip on the snowy cloths and cannot be wiped up easily. By the time dinner is finished it can be a mess.
1985-01-20	SOME OF THE BEST SEAFOOD AROUND	OWNERSHIP of the small bistro facing the Norwalk River has been a revolving door. First there was 50 Water Street. Then it became Becket's Landing. And now we find just plain Water Street. Though the ownership has changed the decor remains much the same, except for the loss of a piano. There are the brick walls of an old glass warehouse, high ceilings, wooden floors, a long dining room - now wisely broken into several small, cosier dining areas - and uncomfortable wooden chairs. Once again we find a staff of young people, this time more accommodating and efficient. There is a certain dej a vu tone to the menu, too, with its smattering of seafood and New Orleans dishes.
1985-01-18	RESTAURANTS	WHENEVER a restaurant uses that overworked term ''new American cuisine,'' I cringe, the way I do when a telephone solicitor offers me a ''prime acre'' of south Florida real estate, sight unseen, for a ''modest'' down payment. Arcadia, a delightful new place on East 62d Street, does use the term, but the restaurant's imaginative and well-conceived performance erased any skepticism on the first visit. Arcadia is co-owned by Ken Aretsky, formerly of Oren and Aretsky, and Anne Rosenzweig, the gifted young chef most recently of Vanessa in Greenwich Village. It is cozy and colorful, with an inviting little mahogany bar up front and several tables. The larger rectangular dining room in the back is ringed by mauve banquettes; on the walls is an enchanting wraparound mural by Paul Davis depicting the four seasons.
1985-01-13	BEST RESTAURANTS (CONTINUED)	"THE turn of the calendar to a new year is always a time to reflect on seasons past. Looking back over the scores of restaurants we have reviewed in the last five years, there are many that come to mind as special. 

The following list, necessarily limited by space, is of places - some humble, some grand - that we would particularly enjoy going back to again and again.

Of course, chefs and service staffs change; in fact, they are a transient group, and this can have an enormous effect upon the food and atmosphere. 

Also, Saturday nights are notoriously difficult for popular restaurants, for the kitchens and waiters can be overextended then. For that reason, Valerie Sinclair and I always visit a restaurant at least twice before giving it a rating."
1985-01-13	A NEW SETTING AND A NEW CHEF	THERE is much that is new about Galleria in Westbury. After a fire last year the restaurant relocated in new quarters about a block away, and a sleeker, more modern look has replaced a rather rococo setting. The chef has also departed to open his own place, Eugen's, on the same street. The dining room. done in beige, is again small and brightly lighted. Except for a side area of a few tables, it seems more crowded than ever. Now there are round tables that, while comfortable enough for two, become cramped with a party of four. And they are so close together that service is sometimes difficult. Not that it matters, because the waiters hardly bother to serve properly. They make little attempt to avoid passing plates in front of a diner or to remember who ordered what.
1985-01-13	OUT OF THE ORDINARY CHINESE	FROM inauspicious storefront beginnings in Norwalk a few years ago, a new and promising Chinese restaurant has ripened in a roomier, more impressive locale in Westport. The restaurant, Beansprout, is now in upstairs quarters at the Carriage Hill Shopping Center, in a space that once housed the Carriage Hill restaurant. Beansprout consists of three well-arranged, attractive dining rooms, with mirrored ceilings, wood-paneled walls decorated with Chinese watercolors and statuary. In spite of a steady, sometimes hectic flow of traffic, service manages most of the time to be efficient, helpful and cordial.
1985-01-06	THE CREAM OF THE STATE'S RESTAURANT CROP	"IN THE last five years, we have covered many restaurants. Some were so poor and uninteresting that we never wrote about them; others closed before our review could be written. Those were frustrating times. But there were enough good and interesting restaurants to make us continue eating our way around New Jersey.

While not a complete list, the following is a compilation of those restaurants we consider most worth remembering and revisiting time and again. 

One star (v) means Good; two, Very Good, and three, Excellent."
1985-01-06	"DINING OUT;

DOWN BY THE RAILROAD STATIONS"	"-tightening, for going back to simple things following the extravagances of the holidays. The two informal and diverting cafes in this week's review may be just the ticket.

 They share several things in common: Both are related to railroad stations (The Soup Emporium is housed in Mountain Lakes's rustic 1912 stone depot, and Union Square occupies a cheerful storefront across the street from the Summit station); both are operated by talented amateur cooks, and both offer take-out delicacies, as well as simple, cozy dining areas with limited menus. 

By day, Union Square features p^ates, salads and croissant sandwiches, but in the evening several uncomplicated, yet sophisticated, dishes are offered. This comes as something of a surprise, given"
1984-12-30	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
MILL OUTLET GOODS AT BARGAIN RATES"	Linens Plus is the name used by two mill outlet stores in the Eastchester Mall with a Scarsdale address and in the Crossroads Plaza area of the town of Greenburgh. The policy is always 35 to 65 percent off suggested retail prices, including first-quality goods, clearly marked seconds, discontinued wares and closeouts. Beyond that, today and tomorrow the Eastchester store has furtherreductions of 40 to 60 percent on the marked prices, owing to the loss of its lease. All sales are final.
1984-12-30	FRENCH FARE IN AN ELEGANT SETTING	LAST summer, after it had been open a little more than a year, La C^ote D'Or in the Garden City Hotel closed for renovations. It reopened in September, with a new menu and a setting that has been made even more felicitous by the addition of shirred fabric covering the ceiling to enhance acoustical comfort. One of our dining companions remarked that the graciously elegant, wood-paneled room with its plush rose banquettes, French chairs, bouquets of flowers and gleaming silver appointments suggested Taillevent, one of the most highly rated restaurants in Paris. Dinners ordered from the fall menu were a different story, contrived and frequently disappointing. But now, with a new winter menu in effect, there has been decided improvement in concept and preparation, and what might have been a one- star rating a month ago is two-star or better. Because the menu is revised quarterly, the overall rating is not more than two stars at this time.
1984-12-23	"DINING OUT;
LIGHT TOUCH, OFF THE BEATEN TRACK"	"LONG POND INN is hard to find. Some secondary roads lead to a poorly lighted sign marking a sprawling parking lot at the far end of which, perched on the edge of a lake, is the rustic log cabin restaurant. At the entrance to the dining room, a cheery winter fire warms guests waiting to be seated at wood-topped tables aglow with elegant little candle lamps. Light pine paneling, metal candle sconces and shirred curtains give the room a cozy country look. The bare wood floor, while in keeping with this theme, nevertheless magnifies noise, which can be considerable when the room is full.

 Open since last July, the Long Pond Inn is certainly a place worth knowing about - for summer or winter visits. The chef prepares food with a sensible, light touch, espousing the spontaneous best of the new French style without being outre. That is not to say that all dishes were raving successes. Some were in fact clumsy or ill-conceived, but the kitchen has enough promise so that a visit, if one is in the neighborhood, could be a satisfying experience."
1984-12-23	"DINING OUT;
BEFORE OR AFTER THE GAME"	"-residential section of Lyndhurst, is an engaging spot for a hearty meal before or after some strenuous rooting at the sports arenas in the nearby Meadowlands. Linebackers' portions of robust, reasonably priced Italian-American fare are offered by this comfortable, dimly lighted ristorante.

 Opened two years ago by David and Claire Gabbay, the original small bar and dining room were expanded recently to include a second dining room. Mr. Gabbay, who trained in Europe and Bergen County (for the most part as a waiter), supervises the kitchen; therefore, as could be expected, service here is professional and informed. The only cavil is that no one waiter is assigned to each table - they all seem to work the whole restaurant - and so continuity is not always assured."
1984-12-23	GOOD ITALIAN IN A HANDY LOCATION	THE lament about there being ''no decent place to eat in Stamford'' is fast becoming passe. While new restaurants may not be opening constantly, there are enough to sustain one's interest. Cafe Morelli is in a handy location for evening theater and concert-goers. It is an even more felicitous lunchtime choice for downtown shoppers. The tiny, informal cafe has the same menu at lunch and dinner, but for elusive reasons the food tastes better and fresher at lunch, and the daytime ambiance is considerably jollier.
1984-12-23	A SUBDUED BUT ELEGANT SETTING	ABOUT two months ago a new restaurant, Eugen's (pronounced Eugene's), was opened in Westbury by the former chef of the Galleria restaurant just up the street. Meanwhile, Galleria, where there had been a fire, has reopened, making Westbury the current focus of new restaurant activity in the area. Eugen's definitely has two-star potential. It is a comfortable place, with tables well spaced. It has been decorated in a style of tasteful elegance that is very subdued; the dining room, in fact, is somewhat staid. The walls are upholstered in a subtle seafoam green and white printed fabric and decorated with drab framed prints; chairs are done in handsome striped silk, and the lighting, from dimmed frosted chandeliers, desperately needs the emphasis provided by votive candles at the occupied tables.
1984-12-16	"DINING OUT;
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK IN SUSSEX"	"RESTAURANT gems sometimes pop up in the most unlikely places. Middleville, for instance, is a long way from practically everywhere. Yet, that rural Sussex County community is the site of a charming old inn that serves some of the most interesting meals we have had in a long time. 

 Steve and Barbara Deren (Carijon is a contraction of their middle names) bought the inn a year ago. Since then, they have renovated it, adding their own brand of charm in the process."
1984-12-16	HOSPITALS COMPETING FOR PATIENTS	DO hospitals make you nervous? Do you put off surgical or medical treatment that might require an overnight stay because your family needs you at home? If so, Greenwich Hospital's All in a Day Program might be the answer. Looking for ''the most advanced life-saving equipment and services available today'' - from cardiac defibrillators and infusion pumps to temporary pace makers? New Milford Hospital might be the place for you. Concerned with paying the hospital bill? Why, charge your operation or other hospital expenses to Visa, MasterCard or American Express at Yale-New Haven Hospital in a system ''similar to what is presently available in most major hotels.'' Or try Johnson Memorial Hospital in Stafford, which has reduced its base emergency room rates for minor injuries from $30 to $35, from $70 to $75 - cash, check or credit card accepted. In Connecticut and around the nation, hospitals have entered the unfamiliar arena of competitive marketing - advertising their services like department stores.
1984-12-16	GOOD SEAFOOD WITH RIVER VIEW	KEEP in mind that things aren't always what they seem as you enter Harbor Park, the large, white ship-like building on the Connecticut River in Middletown. The singles scene at the bar on the ground floor and the pulsating, exploding music might deter you from climbing the stairs to the restaurant. But don't let it, for upstairs, in three quiet dining areas, you can rise above it, so to speak, and in doing so you are in for pleasant surprises. First, there is the view from a long dining room with picture windows that enable you to watch the boats chugging and gliding up and down the river. In warm weather, there is an open-air dining balcony as well. In the rear, an enclosed dining area with a fireplace is a perfect, more intimate winter choice.
1984-12-16	A VARIED MENU AT BARGAIN PRICES	THE Harbor View in Stony Brook is something of a find, a restaurant that provides an attractive setting for dining and has an interesting, varied menu of creditably prepared specialties, a well-balanced wine list and bargain prices. Where's the catch? Only that the portions are quite modest in size. But since the complete dinner includes appetizer, soup or salad, main course with vegetables and dessert, plus a small loaf of bread, it is unlikely you will want a slice of pizza on the way home. Those with large appetites might consider ordering a la carte and selecting one of the main-course pasta dishes as a first course.
1984-12-09	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Big Markdowns On Women's Wear Levine's Factory Showroom in Bridgeport, Conn., is closing out its retail sale of women's clothing, belts and handbags at the present location after 50 years, with warehouse and showroom relocation plans unresolved. The ''everything must go'' prices apply through December, with larger selections to the earliest arrivals. Prices are marked down with stickers: red at 40, green or yellow each 10 percent lower, with the blue sticker representing 70 percent off the manufacturer's suggested retail price. All is first quality, current merchandise and labeled; any summerware is at the highest markdown.

Visa and MasterCard are still accepted, but checks are not. There can be no layaways, holds or alterations now and neither returns nor exchanges. All sales are final. Sizes are 4 to 16 in sweaters, knit tops, blouses, pants, suits, skirts, blazers and dresses; 4 to 16 in petite, 4 to 20 in regular sizes and half-sizes to 22 1/2 for outerwear in all lengths and raincoats, most with removable linings."
1984-12-09	DINING OUT ; SOME INTERESTING CHINESE DISHES	RECENTLY, Hunan Cafe, a tidy little storefront Chinese restaurant on the border between Nassau County and Queens in Floral Park, expanded its base about 50 percent. Previously it must have been the size of a dinette. The restaurant is done in beige with deeper brown trim and carpeting. Attractive posters and some handsome plants provide relief from an otherwise neutral and somewhat austere setting. In the typical contemporary Chinese restaurant style, the tables and chairs are light wood, cane and chrome, with clean, modern lines.
1984-12-09	HE PROMOTES A 'CASHLESS SOCIETY'	''ALL of the companies started from a telephone and a credit card and a computer,'' said Richard A. J. Williams . ''So when you think about the whole fabric, just about all of them use a telephone to make a transaction, a credit card or a check to pay for it, and they are fully computerized.'' Mr. Williams was discusssing the components of Chargit Inc. At 37, Mr. Williams is the president of the Manhattan-based corporation, which was founded in 1974 by a Long Island couple, Arthur and Gladys Golden, to provide entertainment tickets by telephone to credit card customers and has since diversified into a publicly held corporation doing a multimillion-dollar annual business.
1984-12-02	"DINING OUT;
THE NOUVELLE CUISINE OF SPAIN"	"THOSE who think leaden rice, searing spiciness and a slick of olive oil characterize Spanish cuisine are in for a surprise. And those already familiar with the light- handed cocina de hoy, Spain's version of nouvelle cuisine, will approve of the mellow, artistically wrought and often indecipherably delicious dishes Jose Costa has been creating in La Camilia's kitchen since its opening only six weeks ago.

 As a bonus, every Sunday afternoon and weekdays, too, if diners request it, La Camilia presents the traditional tapas - a selection of appetizers that, in Spain, with a glass of wine, serve as a late- afternoon snack to help wait out the late dinner hour. Here, however three of these miniature earthenware casseroles holding mouthfuls of hot, savory morsels can as well serve as a light lunch or supper or Sunday brunch. The selection changes frequently. In recent weeks octopus, scallops, swordfish, clams, fresh sardines, shrimp, tripe and mussels have appeared, their luscious sauces made to be sopped up with pieces of fine warmed bread. Antonio Alvarez and Dionisio Anes, the owners, hope soon to add angulas, or baby eels, as well as other Spanish specialties."
1984-12-02	DOING BUSINESS WITH DISTANT BANKS	TRADITIONALLY, most people have chosen their bank because it has an office near their home or job. Yet, proximity is diminishing in importance as the broadening of banking services makes it easier to do business with a bank far from home and office. Thus, no matter where you live, the big money- center banks can often be the best place to make large deposits, while for the more mundane banking needs, such as checking accounts, a small-town bank may offer a better deal. In depositing funds, there are often advantages in moving time deposits from a small-town bank to a distant money-center bank because its interest rates are higher. Recently, while the Northwestern National Bank of Duluth, Minn., was paying 9 percent interest on a six-month, $10,000 certificate of deposit, major New York banks were paying about 1 1/4 percentage points more.
1984-12-02	A SPECIAL FLAIR WITH SEAFOOD	WITH little fanfare, Stamford has acquired not just one, but several very good restaurants. One of those, La Parisienne on Hope Street, has opened a second establishment downtown, called Saint Tropez. It follows a similar format but has a different menu. Its chef, Roger Weissang, was formerly at Cinquante-Cinq in Greenwich. The breezy decor, with light pastels, beach murals and alcoves, is extremely agreeable, unpretentious, yet not too casual. Our only criticism of the ambiance is the small, wobbly, uncomfortable Bentwood chairs. Service at the new place is actually superior to that at the older one; less officious, more relaxed and welcoming.
1984-12-02	PROSPECTS	Those Lagging Rates Recent headlines have heralded the continuing fall in interest rates. But so far, the resulting glee has not extended to consumers - and is unlikely to do so for some time. Lending rates for consumers are sticking at high levels as market rates - including those paid on deposits - have declined. ''Historically, consumer loan rates are more 'sticky' than market rates when they start to drop, but they are even more 'sticky' this time around,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman/American Express. He said consumer rates are now one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point higher than they have generally been relative to market rates. According to Mr. Sinai, the average cost of funds to banks - what they pay in the Federal funds market when they borrow from each other - has fallen by 2 1/2 points since early October. But the prime, to which many loan rates are tied, has slid just 1 1/2 points. Mortgage rates have slipped less than 1 percentage point. And a Shearson survey showed that 48-month auto loan rates have not dropped at all. Installment credit rates have also held steady. Citibank's Visa and Mastercard customers, for instance, pay 19.8 percent interest, a rate unchanged since 1981.
1984-12-02	SIMPLIFIED MENU IN A FORMAL ROOM	-detailed main dining room in the Marriott Hotel in Uniondale, opened about two years ago, the menu was extremely complicated. A la carte entrees were available in different-size portions from separate listings, and there was a complete dinner selection as well. Ordering was more like negotiating. The menu has now been simplified and, perhaps because the kitchen has less to deal with, the food has become more consistently well prepared. It may also be a testimony to the time it takes for a kitchen to hit its stride.
1984-11-30	RESTAURANTS	IT is usually an auspicious sign in an ethnic restaurant to see at least one customer hyperventilating while waving a hand in front of his mouth. I usually walk over to the table and, when the customer catches his breath, ask what he is eating. I make sure to order it. In the case of Sabor, a small Cuban restaurant in Greenwich Village, that dish happened to be frituras de malanga (deep-fried balls of a Caribbean root vegetable with green hot sauce). The sauce was as sizzling as a Havana afternoon, and to those who fancy spicy tropical food, it was nothing short of a spiritual experience.
1984-11-25	JAPANESE FOOD IN A 'FARMHOUSE'	ON one side of a motor parkway in Hauppauge is Gasho, a reproduction of a 12th- century Japanese farmhouse. Directly opposite, parked at the entrance of another restaurant, is an authentic railroad caboose. What a curious mix of cultures. Although the restaurant is designed to look like an 800-year-old Japanese farmhouse, the food at Gasho is strictly 20th century. It is one of a chain that follows the basic system that originated with the Benihana chain of restaurants, which is owned by another branch of the same Aoki family. Massive teppan grill tables seat eight, and showman chefs cook at the table.
1984-11-25	THREE SPOTS FOR LUNCH IN FAIRFIELD	ALMOST every town has an informal eatery where local residents drop by for a casual, usually inexpensive lunch. One of the frustrations for the infrequent visitor to a town is knowing where such a place exists. Such information is invaluable to anyone in search of a good, modest lunch in cheerful but not fancy surroundings. Herewith, with the upcoming holiday season in mind, are a trio of such places in three Fairfield County towns. They are especially good for shoppers or gallery-goers. GREENWICH
1984-11-23	RESTAURANTS ; Distinctive pasta and French bistro.	When a restaurant menu starts off with a declaration of its cooking philosophy or the admonition ''Good food takes time to prepare, so please be patient,'' that is usually a signal for wise diners to flee. Contrapunto, a chic, informal pasta restaurant at 60th Street and Third Avenue, above a sister establishment called Yellowfingers, does just that, boasting of a uniqueness and quality ''not generally found elsewhere.'' Fortunately, however, there is more than hot air blowing out of the kitchen. This restaurant, while limited in scope, puts considerable energy and imagination into making its pastas truly distinctive. The menu begins with four appetizers, all good: a mixed green salad with a walnut oil dressing; grilled mushrooms with garlic; air-dried beef with Parmesan cheese, and a salad of Italian cheeses and roasted peppers. Following are 20 pastas, both fresh and imported, and a handful of specials. There isn't a real clunker among them. Some of the artful pasta presentations are as colorful as a Matisse landscape, blending fresh vegetables, herbs, seafood and all sorts of cheeses in diverting and often delicious ways. Almost anything with seafood is a safe bet. Try the capelli marina piccola, strands of al dente angel hair pasta flecked with dried tomatoes, shallots, leeks and basil, all crowned with a diadem of little neck clams in the shell; or the fettuccine with chunks of sweet fresh lobster in a mild sage-and- butter sauce.
1984-11-18	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"From Local Artisans The World Over The Bruce Museum's Fifth International Folk Arts Bazaar in Greenwich, Conn., is open today from 2 to 5 P.M. as a display in the lecture gallery, and by Monday thousands of these unusual objects will still be available through the gift shop, where prices range from 25 cents for children's ''button baby'' trinkets to $500 for a Foo dog from China.

The museum, which conducts school programs all year on fine arts, marine life, American Indians and birds and mammals, will open an exhibit Friday in the main gallery of the latest work from local artisans: ''Visions in Miniature: Period Rooms and Houses by the Greenwich Miniaturists.'' The reception for this exhibit will be next Sunday from 2:30 to 4:40 P.M. and is open to the public at no charge that day only. At other times the admission is $1 for this special miniature exhibit, but usually entry is by donation."
1984-11-18	STEAKHOUSE WITH AN AIR OF FINESSE	THE Polo Club, which opened a few months ago in Roslyn, is a steakhouse and theN some. The suggestion of pretension in its name does not detract from the seriousness of its approach. Clubby, masculine decor and copious portions, the expected hallmarks of steakhouse dining, are combined with attentive Continental service, a less frequent attribute of such places. And although hearty eaters will find their appetites satisfied for slabs of meat simply grilled, there is also enough good cooking to appeal to anyone who appreciates more finesse.
1984-11-18	SPECIALS BEST AT LOW-KEY SPOT	IF you are heading along Interstate 95 at mealtime and crave something home-cooked but do not want an elaborate, formal meal, Basem's might be just the place for you. Located just a few blocks from the highway on the Boston Post Road in Guilford, Basem's sits inconspicuously in a small shopping complex. Decor is modest but pleasant - peach-colored walls with darker wainscotting, a few baskets tacked to the upper walls, Tiffany-style overhead lights and cafe curtains on the windows. At night candles on each peach-colored tablecloth add a soft, romantic glow to the plain room.
1984-11-11	"DINING OUT;
MEXICO COMES TO NEW PROVIDENCE"	"growing segments of the American food industry. Chain operations are opening outlets right and left, and their appeal is obvious, particularly to the young. They serve copious quantities of fun food (albeit bearing little resemblance to that encountered south of the border) at moderate prices and in casual surroundings.

 El Ranchero, in the Union County community of New Providence, goes the run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurants one better, for the chef-owner, Fabio Hernandez, prepares a number of above-average dishes, both Tex-Mex finger food and regional Mexican."
1984-11-11	WORLD WAR II BARGE IN NEW ROLE	THE Barge, moored at the Capri Marina in Port Washington and accessible from a canopied gangplank, is not new but it is kept up-to-date. It changed hands about two-and-a-half-years ago and under the present management has become a reliably good place for fresh fish and shellfish. According to an explanation on the menu, it is an actual World War II torpedo recovery barge built of wood so as not to be vulnerable to magnetic detonators. After the war it served as a houseboat for many years, eventually becoming a restaurant. On more than one occasion during severe storms it ran aground or sank. But it seems pretty fit at the moment, the interior criss-crossed with heavy support beams. Many of the tables have a water view from windows that run its length. Reservations are not accepted and now that the summer crowds have diminished somewhat it is worth remembering for informal but satisfying dining.
1984-11-04	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL"	"As the holidays draw near, special events and promotions enable shoppers to have access for a limited time to goods not ordinarily available in retail locations. Sometimes shopping ventures are combined with trips to out-of-the-way locales. There also are tax-deductible considerations when nonprofit groups are sponsors and checks are used. Here are several of this week's opportunities.

Tuesday: For one day only, between 9:30 A.M. amd 4 P.M., the Election Day Family Fair at Dyckman Hall of the Scarsdale Congregational Church offers the results of a year's effort by members of the congregation in quilting, weaving, knitting, doll dressing and grapevine wreath weaving. Others who travel and buy with an eye to the fair provide gifts and souvenirs from many countries. There are fresh baked goods and one-of-a-kind antique and Art Deco furniture repaired and restored by Dr. Harry Lennon, a clinical researcher.

Donated art, decorative objects, china, silver, linens and ''white elephants'' are available, along with new and nearly new clothing, jewelry, stamps, toys and creative handicrafts."
1984-11-04	A STYLISH BUT CLASSIC ITALILAN MENU	DESPITE a name that suggests hedonistic excess, Caracalla, a two-month-old restaurant in Syosset, has a look of refined elegance and a stylish but classic Italian menu. The dining room provides a comfortable, traditional setting for fine dining, with large, generously spaced tables, walls covered in pale blue fabric with a subdued pattern and upholstered chairs. The flatware is particularly handsome. The service is seamless, attentive and thoroughly professional. If the cooking, which is sometimes excellent, were as consistent as the service, Caracalla would be one of the finer Italian restaurants on the Island. On the other hand, the qualilty of some of the ingredients is surprisingly indifferent and the preparations, while always attractively presented, are at times very ordinary. With the atmosphere and service taken into consideration, however, the dining experience can add up to two stars.
1984-11-04	A YOUNG CHEF'S 3-STAR IMAGINATION	WHEN it comes to Le Coq Hardi, getting older means getting better. This small, sophisticated country French restaurant in Ridgefield opened two years ago to three-star acclaim. But when its chef left, anxious patrons wondered what would happen next. Pushed to center stage was the young sous chef, Carl Wright, and he has not only held his own but actually increased the restaurant's luster. Where the former chef was an artist with his arrangements, making each plate a picture of perfection in color and texture, Wright concentrates more on experimenting with flavors. Presentation is not neglected, not for a minute, but perhaps it has greater naturalness and spontaneity. While Wright's experiments are not always a complete success, even the few flawed dishes are far more interesting than the tired restaurant cliches one finds so many other places. Virtually every item on Le Coq Hardi's menu excites the imagination.
1984-11-04	FESTIVE DINING	Which places to choose for that special holiday treat? Eight food and wine writers confide their favorites. BLESSED ARE THE BLINISCraig ClaiborneFOOD EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES Restaurant-going can be a form of theater. When diners enter, they become members of the cast. The lavishness of the show varies from one establishment to another, and, to my mind, one of the most colorful stage sets is the celebrity-filled dining room of the Russian Tea Room, where, 365 days of the year, the mise-en-sc ene happens to be Christmas. The chandeliers are always festooned with gold tinsel and sparkling red Christmas tree balls. The polished brass wall sconces, the samovar, the red banquettes, the mirror in the rear that reflects the holiday mood, all add up to a joyous happening. And where can you find a finer selection of fellow actors and actresses, and directors, writers and composers, for that matter? At a recent lunch at the Russian Tea Room I was surrounded at various tables by Ruth Gordon and her husband, Garson Kanin, Peter Stone, Robin Williams, Anthony Perkins and John Kander.
1984-10-28	"DINING OUT;
A PLACE FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS"	"FIVE years have passed since John Foy's Le Delice was reviewed in this space and given three stars, and so the time seemed right for an update. After several recent visits, it is encouraging news indeed that this Morris County restaurant has retained its successful three-star mix of graceful atmosphere, polished service and fine food. 

 Formerly co-chef with his brother, Dennis, of The Tarragon Tree in its original site in Meyersville, Mr. Foy went out on his own and converted an unpretentious old house in Whippany into the engaging setting it is today. Although there is the occasional flawed dish, both the menu, which changes with the seasons, and the food presentations are most attractive and well thought out, yet rarely strained."
1984-10-28	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Classic Clothing In Chappaqua At the Old Colony Shop in Chappaqua the larger portion is stocked with classic women's clothing and a smaller area is devoted to children's wear. Old Colony routinely offers discounts of a full 20 percent on preticketed hosiery, lingerie and leotards, and varying discounts of up to that amount on everything else, with seasonal clearances shifting the markdowns to as much as 70 percent. Women's sizes are 4 to 16 and to l8 for some pants or blouses, and special orders are accommodated.

A flared camel-colored trumpet skirt with two pockets by Ms. Sero sells for $78.32 here and the same maker's striped, dark blue or brown- toned blazer with a collar that can be worn turned up sells for $102.96 - both are 100 percent wool."
1984-10-28	A NEW ROBUST ITALIAN IN DANBURY	THE influx of corporations to the Danbury area may be responsible for another influx as well - that of tempting new restaurants. A recent arrival is Bruno's, a northern Italian restaurant in a small one-story building that once housed a hamburger shop. Dark glass windows wrap around two sides of the free-standing building. From the outside, the darkened windows make the place look closed or abandoned.
1984-10-28	REGIONAL DISHES FROM ITALY	ATTILIO'S in Little Neck, Queens, is a busy place, serious without being pretentious and friendly but correct. It can offer very pleasant dining with an array of dishes inspired by several regions of Italy. Every evening, up to a dozen specials augment the menu. Unfortunately, the captain does not always reel off the entire list, and it can be frustrating to overhear stuffed artichokes, baby salmon or green lasagne mentioned at the neighboring tables some 10 minutes after you have placed your order. Our captain explained that it was too difficult for him to go through the whole catalogue at every table. But if you ask the owner, Attilio Vosilla, he will gladly describe the evening's offerings.
1984-10-21	"DINING OUT;
CHINESE CUISINE IN ARMONK"	"AMONG the many Chinese restaurants celebrating their recent openings up-county, the newly-renovated Flower Dragon in Armonk is probably one of the handsomest. Clever plant-dividers holding a silk lushness of green foliage and white and magenta blossoms, thickly cushioned black-lacquered dining chairs and white linen over plum table skirts with matching napkins strike a harmonious chord against serene dove-gray walls.

 Dressed in colors echoing the decor, Lucille Liang oversees the front of the house. Formal, attentive service completes the carefully wrought scene, one that, at this time, turned out to be pretty much skin deep. Were the kitchen's inconsistent products served in more humble circumstances and by one less vocal and knowledgeable about Chinese cuisine, we would probably have ignored the place. But Flower Dragon has possibilities; and now that the dining room has shaped up so beautifully, perhaps the kitchen's turn will soon be raised to standards of equivalent perfection."
1984-10-21	BEYOND HIBACHI, SERENITY OF SUSHI	LITTLE by little, the discovery of the joys of sushi, sashimi and other Japanese dishes is spreading through the state. The newest outpost is Kabuki, a combination Japanese steakhouse and sushi bar in Danbury. Lodged in a colonial-style house, the restaurant has been partly transformed into a touch of Japan. Two large dining rooms cater to the chop- chop, grill-grill, razzle-dazzle of cooking at the table, hibachi style. The smell of cooking oil in these somewhat cavernous rooms is oppressive, and better ventilation is needed. But in the small dining room beyond the bar, all is serene. A few rattan chairs and tables, a traditional noren, or cloth entrance ''sign,'' and a stylized wall painting of a wave focus attention on the step-down sushi bar in the rear. Two sushi chefs wield their knives and deftly create nigiri-sushi, raw fish formed over an oval of boiled, vinegared rice, and norimaki sushi, boiled, vinegared rice rolled inside a wrapper of seasoned seaweed with a center of raw fish.
1984-10-21	A 'NEW WAVE' CHINESE RESTAURANT	IN many respects, China Garden, a new restaurant in Roslyn, is an example of the latest stage in the evolution of the Chinese restaurant in this era. Until about 10 years ago, menus were dominated by Americanized interpretations of Cantonese food. Although the restaurants might have varied in style from storefront takeout shops to plushly decorated establishments, the cooking rarely strayed beyond the likes of chow mein, lo mein, sweet and sour pork and lobster Cantonese. Then Sichuan and Hunan food, with their emphasis on stronger flavors and spicier cooking, became the vogue. While most restaurants retained their popular Cantonese-American specialties, certain other dishes caught on. Hot and sour soup, hacked chicken, dumplings, Lake Tung Ting shrimp, orange beef and moo shu anything outclassed egg drop soup and pork lo mein as sophisticated diners became more interested in authentic regional cooking.
1984-10-14	"DINING OUT;
IS IT ITALIAN CUISINE? NO, CHINESE"	"WAITERS in black tie, sleek brown and beige decor, tableside preparation and a palate-refreshing sherbet between courses are far from typical of a Chinese restaurant. But for the impressive stone lions at the entrance and the oriental staff inside, Englewood Cliffs' Ming Palace could, from all appearances, be offering steaks or pasta, which it does not, instead of shark-fin soup and Shanghai shrimp, which it does. 

 Opened two years ago by John Kao and C.Y. Chow - the latter came out of retirement after heading the kitchens of Shun Lee Dynasty and other New York restaurants - Ming Palace specializes in the spicy dishes of Szechuan and Mr. Chow's native Hunan. 

Once in a while, a restaurant falls somewhere between the star ratings, making one wish for half- stars. For example, this restaurant offers some delightful two-star preparations in attractive, comfortable surroundings with sometimes efficient service. Alas, a few mediocre dishes, occasionally inattentive service and prices that are as upscale as the ambience keep the rating at one star (and a half)."
1984-10-14	THE GUSTO IS MORE THAN JUST GARLIC	WOOSTER STREET, to anyone living in New Haven, means Italian restaurants. The most recent Wooster Street restaurant, Carbone's, is at the end of the street, near Interstate 95. Inside a storefront buildingthere is a cheerful two-level dining room, with the upper level having a few tables overlooking a somewhat larger area. Cream-colored walls and a high, pressed-tin ceiling give an airy effect to a room that is attractively, but not ostentatiously decorated. On Saturday nights, when there is live music, the spirit seems especially convivial. Waiters are well organized and totally professional, a welcome and unexpected pleasure. Carbone's specializes in robust southern Italian cooking and does it, for the most part, with gusto and flair. Expect to find abundant portions and a generous use of garlic and onions, and enjoy. In several visits, we found very little to fault.
1984-10-14	WHERE THE FARE IS NORTH ITALIAN	AT Donatello, a small, pleasantly subdued and popular northern Italian restaurant in Sayville, you could say the highlights go from A to Z. Some of the appetizers and the zabaglione are outstanding. Unfortunately, dining becomes less appealing in the middle of the alphabet, around the main course. If bresaola is offered as a special appetizer (and it frequently is), it is worth ordering. The thin mahogany slices of piquant air-dried beef are arrayed on a plate, covered with shavings of Parmesan cheese and dressed lightly with wine vinegar and olive oil. Some fresh pepper, applied at the table, adds a nice finishing touch to this flawless presentation.
1984-10-07	"DINING OUT;
ORIENTAL FARE IN HIGHLAND PARK"	"ONCE upon a time in Highland Park, there was a restaurant named Un Peu Bizarre (French for ''a little strange''). The most bizarre thing about it was that it disappeared while we were reviewing it. 

 Several times over the next few months, we called the still-connected telephone number, only to hear a recorded message giving different information regarding the future of the restaurant. We eventually stopped calling, and several months later learned that Kum Moon Kyo, a restaurant specializing in Korean and Japanese food, now occupied the space."
1984-10-07	"DINING OUT;
A HEARTY NEIHBORHOOD SPOT"	"LOOKING approvingly from a large painting, a jolly, plump friar tastes wine from one of his wooden casks, perhaps toasting or blessing the hearty, unascetic appetites necessary to deal with the heaping plates that issue from the kitchen of Luigi's Trattoria. 

 Established 40 years ago, this neighborhood restaurant remains popular with the regulars that greet one another across the room. And although the ownership has changed recently, the menu rings comfortably familiar; certainly, recent visits revealed no surprises; in fact, we remembered many of the dishes from our visit five years ago.

Properly cooked pasta, a plus here, can be ordered in half portions for appetizers. Particularly successful, linguine with white clam sauce bore a generous application of tender chopped clams with one whole juicy clam poised on the edge of the plate. Less notable was a flat-tasting marinara sauce on a side order of spaghetti."
1984-10-07	FRENCH FOOD AND FINE SERVICE	LA COQUILLE in Manhasset has been under new management for several months. The change does not seem to have meant an overhaul. The small, engagingly pretty dining room that was spruced up a few years ago with the addition of some mirrored panels and a French mural is the same, as is the staff, and the menu has not been revised. At one time one of the finest French restaurants on the Island, La Coquille seems to be able to maintain this standard only intermittently these days. The cooking is extremely inconsistent, varying from fairly appealing and carefully done to relatively banal to nearly inedible. But the service is always professional and attentive, enhancing the dining experience even when the food disappoints. Wines are vastly overpriced.
1984-09-30	COUNTRY FRENCH COZINESS	WHEN a restaurant changes ownership, patrons hold their breath. Sometimes a poor establishment becomes a winner. Other times, the process is reversed. Happily, at Le Bon Coin, plus ,ca change, plus c'est la m^eme chose. What several years ago was a very good French restaurant operated by a family has become a very good French restaurant owned by a chef. The new owner, William Janega, brings considerable experience as a French-trained chef to this new undertaking.
1984-09-30	A SINGULAR JAPANESE RESTAURANT	-SE in New Hyde Park, which opened at the beginning of August, seems to have been cut from the same mold as virtually every other Japanese restaurant on the Island (if not in the entire United States), but certain aspects of the menu, the preparation and the presentation of the food set it apart. Although the standard favorites to be found on most Japanese menus are listed, there are also a number of more unusual dishes. The cooking is generally flawless, the food extremely tasty and often served with interestingly seasoned dipping sauces, and the presentation, in beautiful lacquered bowls and boxes or on stoneware dishes of various shapes (no plastic look-alikes here), is lovely. Even the chopsticks are somewhat larger, of a better quality than usual. And they separate easily into batons of equal size.
1984-09-23	A RESTAURANT STARTER KIT	IF there were such a thing as a restaurant starter kit, it might contain the components of a place like The Lamb and the Lion in Elmont, which opened last spring. Fledgling restaurateurs, such as the partners in this enterprise, can test their talents and the public's appreciation of them in a situation like this. The dining room is small, containing fewer than 30 seats. The hours of operation are limited and the restaurant is closed two days a week. Between the menu listings and the daily specials there are rarely more than 10 entrees. The restaurant has no bar (but application has been made for a beer and wine license). At the moment the owner may offer a complimentary glass of wine or allow guests to pour their own bottle.
1984-09-23	NEW JAPANESE SPOT ON OLD SITE	IN Hartsdale where Shimizu-ya once stood, Omasa now presides. If customers have not noticed any change, it would hardly be surprising, for the restaurant remains under the friendly and gracious direction of Noriko (Mary) and Masaru (Steve) Yamada. Those curious about the new name might note the union of ''O,'' the last letter of Mrs. Yamada's first name, and ''Masa,'' the first four letters of Mr. Yamada's first name. The dining room has been given as much redecoration as a small room can take and looks spiffy with blond wood dividers and wall accents against a dark green background. But those who have followed the Yamadas's menus during the last three- and-a-half years might be disappointed with the most recent list of offerings and dismayed at the evolution of the menu: the interesting old dishes - especially fish - have been eased off, leaving, for the most part, items that have become cliches of Japanese cuisine. However, a blackboard lists daily specials and, one hopes, this device will serve to bring back some of the unusual dishes this restaurant once offered.
1984-09-22	REWARDING FAITHFUL (AND GOOD) CUSTOMERS	About a month ago a select group of Neiman- Marcus customers around the country received a hand-delivered basket filled with caviar, wine and other fancy foods. Tucked inside was a note from Richard Marcus, chairman and chief executive officer of the 21-store company thanking the customers - all of whom had spent at least $3,000 at the stores over the previous year - for their loyalty and their business. The baskets marked the start of the latest in a small but growing number of ''frequent shopper programs,'' designed to reward faithful customers and gain new ones. At Neiman-Marcus the program is called Incircle, under which customers receive a point for each dollar they spend. Those who earn 3,000 points in a year receive such gifts as six deliveries of chocolate and those with 100,000 points are given a week in London.
1984-09-22	TRUE COST OF BANK SERVICES	For many years, big commercial banks looked upon consumers primarily as a source of inexpensive deposits. But that has changed dramatically over the last few years, as most banks have begun to view consumers as a potentially lucrative market for financial services. The change is partly a consequence of deregulation, which has increased the interest rates banks must pay to attract and keep consumer deposits and has eliminated usury laws limiting the interest banks may charge on consumer loans. As a result, not only have interest rates and fees charged to consumers increased dramatically, but banks have taken to ''marketing'' their ''products'' as if they were ordinary retailers. Like other sellers of goods and services, banks now rely on come-ons and other ploys, so individuals must shop more carefully for banking services.
1984-09-16	"DINING OUT;
WHERE THE CHEF IS THE OWNER, TOO"	"THE Delaware River town of Lambertville is stealing a bit of neighboring New Hope's thunder these days with the opening of several interesting little restaurants, many of them chef-owned. Alex Wilson was a pioneer in this movement with his tiny Broadmoor Cafe, which has since closed. 

 Wilson Inn, Mr. Wilson's latest venture, a few blocks away, is on a more ambitious scale. Converting an early Victorian town house, which later became a rooming house, into a chic hostelry is no small task. The three-story building, while undoubtedly handsome in its prime, appears to be a victim of what real-estate agents call ''delayed maintenance.'' A second strike against it is its obscure location on a semi-residential street off the beaten tourist track. Even the entrance tucked away at the side is hard to find."
1984-09-16	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Seasonal Festival In New Rochelle The Fall Festival for shoppers in New Rochelle is set for 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Thursday through Saturday and from noon to 6 P.M. next Sunday at more than 35 stores. Yellow umbrellas will mark the reduced-price sidewalk tables and rides and other amusements - plus a flea market Sunday only from 1 to 7 P.M. - will be added to the merchants' offerings.

 City agencies, school groups and religious organizations will have exhibits set up beginning 11 A.M. Friday and professional entertainment will be available at the Gazebo Stage site from 11 A.M. Saturday and 1 P.M. Sunday until about 6 P.M. The rides will continue past the store closing time to dusk. 

 Inside the Outlets Of Pepperidge Farm Pepperidge Farm, long known for its bakery products distributed through supermarkets, also has a division called Fine Oven Products for items sold in its Thrift Stores in Eastchester, Mamaroneck, Mount Kisco and 77 other locations. The company-owned outlets sell both day- old products returned from supermarkets and overruns or irregulars of mail order items from plants owned by the parent company, Campbell Soup."
1984-09-16	FRENCH COUNTRY FARE IN STAMFORD	PREVIOUSLY, when we visited Le Parisien in Stamford at lunchtime, it was noisy and service was slightly frantic, but the food was good enough to earn one star. Now, several years later, it is still noisy, but the service is generally professional and less frantic, and the food has improved considerably. Solid, traditional French, country cooking has helped the restaurant settle into its niche in Glenbrook. As a result, Le Parisien has found a clientele that appreciates the consistently good food produced in the kitchen.
1984-09-16	TRAVEL ADVISORY: TELEPHONNG ALOFT, TRACKING FALL'S FOLIAGE	A Way to Stay In Touch When Aboard a Plane First came the telephone. Then the car telephone. Then the mobile cellular telephone. And now: Airfone. Starting Oct. 15, people who want to conduct business by telephone or make personal calls will be able to do so, even when they're 30,000 feet aloft aboard a commercial airliner.
1984-09-16	STEAK FOR ONE, TWO, THREE, OR FOUR	THE EMBERS in Northport has been open for more than four months, but it provides an example of how long it takes some new restaurants to hit their stride. One would think that four months is ample rehearsal time, especially for a steakhouse with a menu that consists primarily of simple grilled dishes, but a number of rough spots remain. For example, wines, both white and red, are served in tall, narrow tulip-shaped glasses, the kind of stemware that is appropriate only for sparkling wines. The waitress, as she is about to pour the wine, apologizes, explaining that the restaurant has no other wine glasses yet. After four months? It might take four minutes to pick up a few dozen inexpensive but proper 8- to 10-ounce wine glasses at some local discount store. We had our wine served to us in water goblets.
1984-09-14	A VISA-MASTERCARD PACT TO REDUCE DUPLICATION	The Visa and Mastercard credit organizations, which are owned by the banks that issue their cards, have agreed on some first steps in cooperation to cut down on duplication. Russell E. Hogg, president and chief executive of Mastercard, said yesterday that he had urged the cooperative action at the American Bankers Association bank card convention a year ago. The first steps, which mostly involve joint efforts on security matters, were made public at this year's meeting of the bank card convention, held in Washington this week.
1984-09-09	"DINING OUT;
SOCCER STAR'S RESTAURANT IN CLIFTON"	"FOR those unfamiliar with American soccer, Bogie 8 will mean nothing. But for devotees of the game, 8 is the number worn by the Yugoslavian-born captain of the Cosmos, Vladimir Bogicevic (Bogie to his fans). 

 It is also the name of the restaurant he and his two partners opened in Clifton five months ago. 

The building, once a diner, has been transformed into a slick modern restaurant, complete with a curved glass-brick wall in the gray, black and white dining area, and a bar with neon lighting. Here, a pianist/singer performs three evenings a week and a band appears three other evenings."
1984-09-09	MAKING THE SEASON LAST LONGER	IT may seem a trifle late to review a Hamptons restaurant, but this particular candidate, Oliver in Westhampton Beach, did not open until July, and the season, if that is a measure of the viability of an enterprise in the resort area, was nearly half over. Besides, assurances ranging from mid-October until January were given for the continued operation of the place. If you have access to this area out of season (by many accounts the nicest time), put Oliver on your list to try. It is exceedingly handsome, more attractive by far than in its wildly wicker days as Club Pierre. The dark old barn is rimmed with comfortable paisley banquettes, with well-spaced tables and armchairs in the center. Giant lanterns shed minimal light, and carefully placed spotlights bathe many of the tables in pools of brightness. Candles enhance the illumination.
1984-09-03	CONSUMER BANKS' SLOW START	The number of financial services companies crowding into the banking business so concerned Federal regulators last year that they imposed a moratorium on the creation of consumer banks, or ''nonbank banks,'' but not before several slipped through the net. Today, however, it appears that most of the new consumer banks are nonstarters. Their lack of success can be laid largely at the feet of the Federal Reserve Board, which hobbled their activities from the start, making the experiment a limited one. It is also partly a result of consumers' reluctance to accept the innovation. Rather than providing head-on competition to the regular commercial banks, the consumer banks so far have posed little threat and might even be evolving into complements of the long-established banks.
1984-09-02	"DINING OUT;
MEXICN FARE IN MOUNT KISCO"	OVER the summer, Westchester seems to have caught taco fever. Mexican restaurants have sprung up all over the county, even in northern regions usually the last to enjoy the delights of new ethnic cuisines, which tend to establish themselves first down county. Last June Pancho's & Gringo's settled into a block of modern shops behind Mount Kisco's Calico Corners. As in other places serving Mexican food, this restaurant dishes out its share of gloppy combination plates that challenge diners to pick out the enchilada, burrito and tostada hidden in the culinary landscape. But even with its flaws, Pancho's & Gringo's offers fare a substantial notch higher than that served in other such restaurants. One had better have reservations for weekend evenings.
1984-09-02	IN THE FRENCH-CONTINENTAL MANNER	THE suggestion to visit Marcel's Locust Valley Inn in Locust Valley came from someone who advised that it was the food, not the decorations, that was worth recommending. Both the exterior and interior of this restaurant are done in a pseudo-rustic half-timbered style. A dark and busy bar occupies one side of the building. The roomy dining room on the other side has a massive fireplace, brick walls, leaded glass windows both real and simulated, a balcony and a shingled roofline jutting out of one wall, creating a confusing melange of both indoor and outdoor decorative effects. The tables are covered in pink and nicely set, and the service is generally efficient and accommodating.
1984-09-02	INN IN MYSTIC, MORE CARE NEEDED	CAPT. DANIEL PACKER, according to Mystic lore, was a tavern and ferryboat operator back in 1754 when he built the frame house that became known as the Fort Rachel Tavern. Now, 230 years later, the tavern, which stood empty, vandalized and ready for demolition, has been carefully rehabilitated, beginning six years ago. Since last November, the old tavern has been open for business as a restaurant called the Captain Daniel Packer Inne.
1984-08-26	TORTILLAS, BUT ALSO MUCH MORE	UNLIKE some of the Mexican restaurants on the Island that belong to chains, El Tapatio in Great Neck offers a varied menu that goes beyond the popular stuffed tortilla combination plates. This extremely pleasant place opened almost a year ago and, according to the manager, the name is what an inhabitant of Guadalajara is called. There are ample selections for the lover of tacos, flautas and enchiladas. But those who wish to sample dishes that do not come wrapped in the ubiquitous corn or flour tortilla will find a number of interesting choices.
1984-08-26	DINING OUT ; TANGY SICHUAN IN CANAAN	The Yale in China program is well-known in academia, but in Canaan, it is China in Yale - the Yale Barn restaurant, that is. A few years ago it was a respected French restaurant. Redecorated and with new ownership, the Yale Barn is respected once again, but this time for its Sichuan Chinese cuisine. The two Chinese chefs and the American manager who own the restaurant formerly provided this part of the state its only taste of China, at the White Hart Inn in Salisbury.
1984-08-19	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Gourmet Delights Baked Daily The Upper Crust Bakery on North Avenue in New Rochelle is a source for gourmet concoctions baked daily in enough variety to satiate the most exotic appetites either on the spot (just three stools at a small counter), at the office or at home immediately or to be stored for a subsequent picnic.

 No smoking is allowed to obscure the mix of fragrances from the Austrian, French or Danish breads, pastries, cakes, cookies, quiches, tortes, tartes and pies, and bulk purchases long in advance of need can be frozen at home.

The Upper Crust will have its first birthday Dec. 7, but its reputation has grown beyond the area's residents and habitual discount shoppers to develop its own customers from among Iona College students learning, among other things, to eat well. It also lures workers from the Department of Social Service offices near City Hall, quite a long walk on a hot summer day, but with the promise of savoring a buttery croissant or a puff pastry bowtie (75 cents), a pain au chocolat or cheese-filled pain (85 cents), or a blueberry or apple turnover (90 cents)."
1984-08-19	"DINING OUT;
OLD-FASHIONED FRENCH CUISINE"	"NOW and then it is comforting to go back in time and indulge in hearty, predictable French fare, to pretend that Nouvelle Cuisine, light reduction sauces and tiny portions were but a flash in the pan.

 Escargots, Vichyssoise, duck with sauce Normande and cr eme caramel - staples of the bistros in Manhattan's West 50's - are just a few of the tried-and-trues offered at Cafe de Paris in Cliffside Park (near Fort Lee), which was opened a year ago by Chef Andre Pernod. 

A veteran of several classic, now sadly defunct, French restaurants in New York, including Le Pavillon and Cafe Chauveron, portly, white-haired and distinguished-looking Chef Pernod now for the first time has his own establishment.

Cafe de Paris has mauve walls, burgundy carpet, posies on the comfortably spaced tables and a tiny bar by the entrance presided over, as in France, by la patronne. Service by the two waiters, who speak a charming sort of Franglais with strong Italian accents, is cozy and attentive."
1984-08-19	A WELCOME CHINESE ARRIVAL	OMEI, a recent addition to Oyster Bay, is a good example of the improvement in Chinese restaurants on the Island since the mid-1970's. Americanized interpretations like chow mein and chop suey, once standard fare, are being replaced by a host of regional Chinese dishes, including exotic specialties that, in the past, had to be ordered in advance. At Omei, for example, Peking duck is always available. Shark fin soup, frogs' legs, turnip cakes, Chinese broccoli and, in season, pheasant are also on the menu. The public is sampling these dishes along with a number of fairly authentic Hunan, Sichuan, Cantonese and Peking-style preparations that are now becoming commonplace. One regularly finds cold appetizers, pungent sha cha seasonings, dishes made with lamb and veal, an increasing number of vegetarian appetizers and main dishes and vibrant sauces that lightly gloss the ingredients rather than flooding them with cornstarch-thickened gravies.
1984-08-19	A COZY TOUCH OF ENGLAND	IF you are nostalgic for a touch of England, you will find it in Woodbury at a small eatery called The Little London. In its low-key way, this small, homey restaurant goes about changing the general perception of English cooking as overcooked cabbage and boiled beef. Your first sight may not be reassuring. The Little London, located in a small shopping complex, is tiny, with minimal decor. Postcards of English scenes, photographs of Prince Charles and the Princess of Wales, plants, English horse brasses tacked to the dark wood walls, small British flags in beer bottles and plasticized placemats depicting English scenes suggest shoestring decorating. Never mind. Friendly, attentive and helpful service does much to compensate for a dearth of style and lighting that is depressingly dim.
1984-08-18	AVOIDING THE THEFT OF CREDIT	AN American Express card customer spent a weekend in New York staying at expensive hotels and eating at chic restaurants. Several months later unfamiliar charges appeared on his bill - some from cities he had not been to in more than a decade. American Express officials told him they assumed his credit card number was taken by a dishonest employee of one of the places he patronized on his New York trip and was passed along to a counterfeiter. A MasterCard holder received a telephone call informing her that she had won a valuable grand prize in a nationwide contest, open only to credit card holders. To verify that she had a credit card, the caller asked her to read him her account number. She never received a prize, but she did receive a MasterCard bill filled with charges she did not make - courtesy of someone who had put her number on a counterfeit card.
1984-08-17	INSURANCE SALES BEGIN AT 2 CITIBANK BRANCES	Citibank, which has said that it wants to add insurance to its array of financial products, began offering life insurance policies yesterday through an insurance company at two of its New York City branches. Under the arrangement, term, universal and whole-life policies will be sold at Citibank by salaried employees of the American International Life Assurance Company of New York. The company, a member of the American International Group, which took in more than $1 billion in life insurance premiums last year, has leased space in Citibank branches.
1984-08-12	"DINNG OUT;
A FAIR, A FOLkSONG, ARESTAURANT"	"A PART from being a centuries-old event in the north of England and the name of a hauntingly beautiful folk song, Scarborough Fair is also the name of a six-month- old restaurant in Sea Girt. 

 The owner has retained the physical appearance of what used to be a craft and gift shop in a glass and wood building. Tables are at different levels, there are ceiling fans and an abundance of plants. The total atmosphere is charming."
1984-08-12	SALADS AND VEGETABLES AND MORE	AT first glance, the menu at Beanstalk suggests that this attractive yet informal cafe-restaurant in Woodbury (with a branch in Manhattan, at Rockefeller Center) might be a health food restaurant. Or at least a ''healthy food'' restaurant. Why else would they serve hot carob instead of hot chocolate? Also, many salads and vegetarian dishes are listed, pasta made from spinach and artichokes is featured, yogurt and Tofutti (a nondairy frozen dessert made from tofu) are served in place of ice cream and on the back of the menu diners are assured that the food contains no preservatives and that only honey, fruit juices and raw sugar are used as sweetenings. With the exception of desserts, every dish comes on a bed of romaine leaves.
1984-08-12	WILD-GAME DISHES FOR THE BRAVE	IF the Walter Mitty in you dreams of stalking wild game and then devouring it by candlelight in the wilds, dream no more. At least part of this fantasy can be fulfilled at a new restaurant called the Coppermine Inn, which sits at the edge of Lake Zoar in Oxford near Derby. Most of the prettily set tables in the L-shaped dining room have a full view of the placid lake. In clear weather it is possible to have drinks before dinner outside on a rather rustic open terrace. Service manages to be both professional and friendly.
1984-08-05	"DINING OUT;
FRENCH ARRIVES IN YORKTOWN"	"WHILE most people are wary of being fooled by gold-plated brass, at The Coachlight Inn they must drop their guard and jump in with both feet to find the gold brass-plated. Ignore the stale tobacco smell, loud voices and thumping juke box from the partitioned bar at the entrance and be rewarded in the back dining room with some fancy cooking at prices that are a bargain for this kind of quality and culinary inventiveness. 

 At around 7 P.M. most weekday evenings and on weekends the bar empties out and the juke box remains silent. That is when a growing number of knowledgeable diners troop in for dishes that occasionally approach two-star proportions."
1984-08-05	DEALS ON WHEELS: RENTING A CAR	TRAVELERS planning to fly into a city and rent a car are finding that automobile rental prices ''are getting more and more like airline fares,'' says Sunny Murphy, a New York City travel consultant. The bewildering array of rental prices and conditions reflects the dramatic changes occurring in this mushrooming industry, and Miss Murphy says that consumers who shop around can find some attractive deals. Finding a deal wasn't always so easy. For years, the auto rental industry had a fairly sedate three-tiered structure: There were the big three - Hertz, Avis and National - situated at every American airport and business district. They charged premium prices to provide new cars to business travelers. Then there were the national and regional moderate-price operations situated near, rather than in, airports and downtown areas - the Budgets, Thrifty's, Econo-cars and others. And there were the strictly local operators - the service stations and new car dealers who had a few cars they rented out.
1984-08-05	ITALIAN FARE IN AN INTIMATE SETTING	LOCANDA, a new Italian restaurant in Merrick, is under the same management as Caminari's in Locust Valley. With its stylish contemporary decor, Locanda has a very different look from the parent establishment, which is done with classic old World formality. At Locanda, rosy beige walls lighted by handsome bronze sconces that suggest an Art Deco feel are interspersed with mirrored panels. Attractive green patterned upholstery in a geometric floral design on the chairs and the sides of the bar adds color contrast. Tables are well-spaced and the restaurant has a warm, pleasant intimacy. It is professionally staffed, with a hierarchy of captains, waiters and busboys. But service can be disjointed and lacking finesse - the servers are often unaware of who ordered what.
1984-08-05	PRETTY PLACE IN LAKEVILLE	ONCE undernourished, gastronomically speaking, the northwest corner of Connecticut is currently thriving. Within the past year a number of new restaurants have opened. One of the prettiest, and judging by the crowds, successful, is The Woodland, located in a gray clapboard building along Route 41 in Lakeville. Seating capacity is limited and confined to a single room. As the restaurant takes no reservations for parties under six, this can be inconvenient, for there is really no place to wait. The dining room suggests more roominess than actually exists, with tables well-spaced, large wooden booths with dubonnet cushions, natural wood, stylized serigraphs on white walls and natural oak floors. Service on the whole is pleasant and reasonably efficient, if insufficiently trained.
1984-08-02	PSSST! WANT THE INSIDE SCOOP ON C3I?	In a suburban shopping mall near Fairfax, Va., resides the world headquarters of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association. Should the fancy strike this fall, you can take a $510 three-day course sponsored by Afcea, as insiders call it, on military communications and cryptography. But only if you have a ''secret'' clearance, a ''need to know'' and are a citizen of the ''Free World,'' according to brochures. Since 1982 the association has offered classes in a field known as Command Control, Communications and Intelligence. The field, dubbed C3I - pronounced ''see-cubed-eye'' in language borrowed from high school algebra - is one of the fastest growing in the military-industrial establishment, as Pentagon planners give high priority to the problem of orchestrating the forces they have been buying of late.
1984-08-01	FRENCH CREDIT CARD UNIFICATION	All French banks and financial institutions will soon start issuing a single national credit card that will be accepted at more than 300,000 sales points in France and anywhere else in the world where Visa cards are honored, under an agreement announced today. Foreign visitors to France holding Visa, Mastercard or Eurocard credit cards will be able to use them wherever the new credit card, called Carte Bancaire, is accepted. The main aim of the new card is to encourage the development of a sophisticated nationwide electronic payments system - one that could be sold abroad - by preventing wasteful competition from smaller, rival systems.
1984-07-29	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Lots of Leather Goods At Clearance Prices Marvin's Luggage, in the PathMark-McDonald's Yonkers shopping center called High Ridge just north of Tuckahoe Road, is a source for luggage, handbags, leather accessories, gifts and umbrellas at 20 to 50 percent off suggested retail prices. A summer clearance now reduces former prices further and fall colors and styles are arriving weekly for sale at discounts.

 The nationally advertised luggage is made by Lark, Samsonite, Ventura, Skyway, American Tourister and M&M; Verdi. Soft luggage, garment bags, carry-on totes and duffles are also sold. Repairs to luggage can be arranged in the shortest possible time in an emergency, with all work done at the shop, and Marvin's is authorized by 27 airlines to repair or replace damaged luggage."
1984-07-29	"DINING OUT;
SEAFOOD IN A LANLOCKED SETTING"	"RESTAURANTS known for their ''all you can eat'' specials tend to be viewed by lovers of fine food in the same light as Bloomingdale's customers might view the corner ''five and dime,'' the premise being that, if you can eat as much as you like for a fixed price, then you're buying quantity but not quality. 

 Most of the time, these people are right. Occasionally, however, one comes across a restaurant such as The Chesapeake Bay Seafood Company in the Morris County community of Long Valley. There, the seafood, even on the two ''all you can eat'' nights (Monday for shrimp and Wednesday for crabs) is, for the most part, very fresh, carefully cooked and full of flavor."
1984-07-29	'STING' UNCOVERS CREDIT CARD FRAUD	WHITE PLAINS UNDERCOVER investigators, armed with fake credit cards, have ''shopped'' nearly a dozen stores from Yonkers to Port Chester and arrested 15 merchants and sales clerks for accepting forged Visa, MasterCard and American Expresss cards. The ''sting'' operation originated last November when the office of District Attorney Carl A. Vergari was approached with information on store owners and clerks who allegedly accept credit cards they believe to be stolen and add profits for themselves in either cash or merchandise by ringing up false sales. In what Mr. Vergari called ''one of the most surprising and disturbing discoveries'' in the investigation, workers in less than 5 percent of the stores called police or security officers after being shown a handful of ''stolen'' cards. Although the total amount involved in the 15 Westchester arrests was about $7,500, such ''collusive'' practices by merchants result in an estimated $500 million worth of losses for the nation's banks and credit-card companies, according to Jon N. Willcox, deputy chief of Mr. Vergari's Frauds Bureau, who coordinated the investigation.
1984-07-29	AN INTERESTING EAST END MENU	HENRY'S ON THE CANAL in Hampton Bays, conveniently situated just off the Montauk Highway where it crosses the Shinnecock Canal, is a pleasantly understated restaurant. Dark wood paneling and beams contrast with stretches of white walls, sheer curtains float lazily in the open windows, and ceiling fans circulate the summer air in the high-ceilinged dining room. The simplicity of the setting contrasts with the elaborateness of the descriptions of the food. Some wildly creative-sounding preparations that have appeared on the menu recently include grilled swordfish steak with lichee-nut butter, fresh tuna steak grilled with black bean sauce and semiboneless duck with orange and mango sauce. The rice that can accompany these dishes is described as having been cooked in duck stock with basil, and each night's menu is likely to be augmented by at least four or five specials, no less complex than the dishes that appear on the printed list.
1984-07-22	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Bargain Sports Gear At Chappaqua Site Second Season Sports opened in Chappaqua in February last year, but soon outgrew its first location. Now the barn of a former garden center houses all manner of sports equipment - bought at auction or on consignment - and discounted items, accessories and clothing, new and used, are on display in the barn and in a second building.

 The front lawn has several beached sailboats at two-thirds of what they would sell for retail, plus an easy-to- pop-up dome tent for three at $58. New tennis sneakers for men, women and children are made by K-Swiss and cost $24.95 and sneakers by Wilson Bata and Asahi sell for $5 and $8. Tretorn canvas sneakers and tennis dresses, T-shirts, running shorts and tank tops by Descente are half price and new bathing suits by Head, Ocean and Gulbenkian cost $7.95, the wholesale price. All cotton canoeing shirts are marked $6.95 and are unworn, and still-boxed duck boots, ordinarily $28, are $9.95 here."
1984-07-22	"DINING OUT;
SEASIDE DINING: TIDE IS TURNING"	"HAPPILY, the tide appears to be turning favorably on the Shore dining scene.  From Doris and Ed's in Highlands down to Restaurant Maureen in Cape May, plus several intriguing spots that are bobbing up in between, it is possible to indulge in some delightful dining along the coast. 

 This has not always been the case. Just four summers ago, this reviewer was asked to write an article rating ''The 10 Best Restaurants at the New Jersey Shore,'' and what a challenging assignment that turned out to be. The question then seemed to be not so much which were the best restaurants but, rather, which were the least mediocre. What with mob scenes on weekends and frequent turnover of student help, quantity more often than not won out over quality at many beach establishments."
1984-07-22	A TOUCH OF SPAIN ON L.I. SOUND	EXCEPT that its view from expansive plate glass windows is of a municipal parking area rather than the waterfront, Costa de Espana in Port Jefferson is an appealing restaurant, especially in summer. Spanish food, with its refreshing gazpacho, seafood combinations, bright colors of golden rice and scarlet pimentos, pitchers of sangria and the happy informality necessitated by dishes made with seafood in the shell is particularly appropriate at this most casual of seasons. Even though the location in POrt Jefferson does not afford a view, it does offer the visitor a bustling waterfront village to explore before or after dinner with shops and a wharf. A summer excursion with Port Jefferson as its goal can also include a meal at Costa de Espana.
1984-07-22	A PLACE TO SNACK IN STAMFORD	DINING out sometimes means ''snacking out,'' stopping somewhere on the way to or from a movie, a pub or a trip to the beach. With that in mind, a new restaurant in Stamford that has settled into an old locale - Jimmy's Seaside, where Brick's used to be - might very well fill the bill. There is nothing pretentious about Jimmy's Seaside, which is named not for its marine life, but because it is at the end of Seaside Street. The large, cavernous room in the rear serves as the setting for live entertainment. The dining area, which seats a mere 34, is up front, separated from the bar by a series of gray wood ballustrades. A few pictures of ships adorn the wall. Service is casual (our waitress wore shorts), but reasonably competent.
1984-07-15	"DINING OUT;
A RESTAURANT NEAR CARAMOOR"	"THE restaurant site at the Katonah Station has changed hands many times. Right now the restaurant is called S.B.R.'s for Samuel Boyd Rogers, the owner, and it has been open for more than a year and a half, which might be a record. It serves simple, unimaginative dishes, decently prepared, and, coincidentally, it is one answer to readers' requests for dining spots near Caramoor, just three miles away. Those desiring a pre-concert meal had best announce curtain time at the outset; dining room staff can be inexperienced and the pacing slow.

 Once the station's baggage room, the small dining room has awkward proportions, higher than its length or width, a condition that is relieved somewhat by low-hanging plants, lamps and pictures. Despite the few Victorian glass lamps, the feel is contemporary. Carpets help soften the echoes, although little can be done about the raucous laughter and blaring radio (with commercials) intruding from the adjoining bar when it's full, usually on weeknights."
1984-07-15	AN IRISH PUB WITH A VARIED MENU	TO call Finn MacCool's in Port Washington an Irish pub does not tell the full story. The theme of this new place is decidedly Gaelic; one side of the spacious premises is occupied by a bar that seems to have an active following and remains open until 3 A.M., but the dining areas are extremely pleasant. They have subdued lighting, brick walls and cozy, attractive setting. Touches of green are evident without being overbearing, and ducks made out of straw, metal and pottery are placed around the room. The breadbasket, which comes filled with Irish soda bread as well as rolls, is also in the shape of a duck. Although there are different menus for lunch, dinner and brunch, they are varied and offer choices that range from hamburgers and salad plates to steaks, duck and some Continental specialties. A blackboard listing augments the printed menu.
1984-07-15	A WONDER IN WETHERSFIELD	WHAT is new in Wethersfield is a restaurant, a very good one, in a historic district long in need of such an embellishment. Standish House is in an imposing building that dates to 1787. The beautifully restored house is a pure delight, infusing any meal with the sense of a special occasion. Upstairs and ground-floor dining rooms are softly lighted, with well-spaced, gracefully set tables. Pearl-gray walls are decorated with etchings of thistles and other plants. Brass chandeliers and finely polished old wood floors are reminders of the house's colonial origins.
1984-07-08	MEMORIES ARE MADE OF THIS	WHEN Tapestries opened in Greenwich in late 1982, its many attractive attributes gave promise of better things to come. Well, they have come. Visits over the past several months have convinced us that this small, beautifully designed restaurant has overcome its few past problems and now provides consistently satisfying dining experiences. The softly lighted upstairs dining room is as pretty as ever, with well-spaced tables and tones of aubergine used in the walls, stunningly spotlighted fresh-flower arrangements, vases and opalescent sheer curtains. The intimate ground-floor dining room is a more Edwardian setting, equally comfortable and attractive.
1984-07-04	A Movie Theater Taking Credit Cards	Moviegoers short on cash or weary of waiting in line for a cashier now can use credit cards to buy tickets from an automated-teller machine in a first- of-its kind experiment at a Dallas theater. Between 5 percent and 15 percent of people attending the Prestonwood 5 movie theater are using the machine, which was installed almost three months ago, a spokesman for the theater said.
1984-07-01	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Crafts Supplies And Workshops Crafts End, in the Greenburgh Shopping Center at the western edge of White Plains, is a smaller version of a 7-year-old shop of the same name in Norwalk, Conn., and features the same variety of handicraft supplies and day and evening classes. In White Plains, the notions department was retained in the conversion from a fabric shop and wall stenciling was added during remodeling. This Colonial skill is taught in Norwalk.

 A glassed-in cabinet near the front door holds handcrafted items as samples to inspire those registering for workshops and classes this summer. Shelves across the rear wall have examples of different skills that have been demonstrated in classes. The July 9 minicourse is Victorian Net Darning Ornaments; on Aug. 4 the goal will be to make a Fantasy Father Christmas, described in the catalogue as ''an olden-style elf.''"
1984-07-01	"DINING OUT ;
THE BARGAIN OF A CHINESE BANQUET"	"DESPITE rising costs, Chinese restaurants continue to offer value. This fact was borne out recently when we paid as much for dinner for four at one of the state's three-star restaurants as we did for a banquet for 12 at Chop-Sticks in the Union County community of Berkeley Heights. 

 We had asked one of New Jersey's leading Chinese-born cookbook authors and cooking teachers to arrange the banquet so that we could sample dishes that might not ordinarily have been available on the regular menu, and also to see if the standard of cooking was different when ordered by an Oriental rather than an Occidental. 

The result was interesting, but not because the quality of the cooking changed. In fact, two dishes that we had ordered at a previous dinner were also served during the banquet, and they were the same each time."
1984-07-01	THE COOKING OUTSHINES THE STYLE	AT the Brittany, an outpost of French cuisine in the tiny, bucolic village of Wading River, some reliably good cooking makes up for a definite lack of style. That the prior tenant was a bar and grill is evident from the dark wood-paneled walls, orange leatherette booths and dim, wagon-wheel chandeliers. Last fall the place was taken over by a Belgian couple (he does the cooking, she is the hostess) who are negotiating to purchase and have plans to redecorate. The menu, mostly consisting of classic and provincial French dishes, is augmented by daily specials that usually focus on locally available seafood. The preparation is often ambitious but with results that are better than either the surroundings or the banal presentation might lead one to expect.
1984-06-29	RESTAURANTS	SIX months and two chefs after it opened just down the street from the Joyce Theater, Roxanne's is humming softly. Through floor-to-ceiling windows, this tiny oasis on a dusty block of Eighth Avenue sends out its welcoming beacon of light. And at the door, Roxanne Betesh, who has learned her trade at some of the city's better small restaurants, seems to treat friend and stranger equally well. It's an attitude she has imparted to her staff. With its garden on the lower level, spotlights that turn bouquets into dramatic statements, simple flowered fabric and glazed bricks, this narrow space has been turned into a romantic candlelit hideaway. Except for an occasional loud party that increases the decibel level of the 26-seat dining room, conversation usually provides a pleasant background for an exceptional dinner.
1984-06-24	A MUCH-IMPROVED CAFE	ALL too often, in restaurants as elsewhere, success goes to the head. A restaurant lavishly praised and acclaimed suddenly becomes complacent, careless, sloppy. When the reverse happens, there is cause for celebration. In the case of Versailles in Stamford, let us make it a small celebration for the time being. A year ago this tiny restaurant, an offshoot of a patisserie-bakery in Greenwich, had enough problems to be considered only a fair choice for dining out. But recent visits indicate that the most severe problems are now solved, and the attractive, cafe- like eatery is well on its way.
1984-06-24	CITI'S SOARING AMBITION	AS with the great empires of the past, the sun never sets on Citicorp. Whether it is Chicago or Cairo, Sioux Falls or Singapore, the familiar Citicorp sign is there. And, last week, in the highest sanctum of the Citicorp world, the power changed hands. Walter B. Wriston, the nation's most influential banker, handed the reins to John S. Reed, a boyish-looking wunderkind, who will take over the premier bank in August. The announcement ends years of speculation over Mr. Wriston's replacement and sets the course of Citicorp for decades to come. In taking over as chairman and chief executive, Mr. Reed assumes command of a bank unlike any other. Citicorp, parent of Citibank, has led a charge in recent years to unshackle banking from its straitjacket regulations of old and to open fertile new fields for profit. With offices in all but nine states, Citicorp, through its cleverness, aggressiveness and ambition, has become virtually a national bank - in a nation that allegedly prohibits interstate banking. It does business in 94 other countries, and is the world's biggest private lender. In its drive for customers, Citicorp has muscled its way onto Main Streets everywhere, reshaping competition here and abroad.
1984-06-23	WHEN A LOAN IS REFUSED	CAUTION: If you are a good credit risk, lenders may hold it against you. This can happen - even though the prospective borrower may have an impeccable credit history and a moderate debt load - because he is thought to have too much other credit available. Yet most or all of this credit capacity could be in the form of aline of credit that the borrower has not drawn on and does not intend to draw on. For example, consumers have been denied loans for such major purchases as a car, boat or recreational vehicle because the lender believes the line of credit on their bank credit cards or checking accounts is at, or close to, the overall debt they can handle. Even if the credit line or overdraft checking account is wholly or partly unused, the creditor may still be worried that the loan applicant could use it at any time and thereby be overextended with the addition of an installment loan.
1984-06-20	CITICORP IS SAID TO CHOOSE REED AS NEW CHIEF	Citicorp, the world's largest banking organization, has named John S. Reed, an engineer by training and a consumer marketing executive by experience, to succeed Walter B. Wriston as chairman and chief executive, according to sources within the bank. Mr. Wriston, who has been responsible for much of the dramatic change that has taken place in the banking industry over the past decade, is to retire at the end of August. The 45-year-old Mr. Reed, who has been vice chairman in charge of Citicorp's consumer-banking activities, has had practically no experience in the traditional commercial-banking activities of lending to giant corporations. He joined Citicorp in 1965 and has been in charge of its consumer business for 10 years.
1984-06-17	NEW CAFE IS BETTER AT LUNCH	STAMFORD'S once sparse restaurant scene has, over the past couple of years, been undergoing a slow but steady metamorphosis. The newest arrival is Mems Cafe, a small restaurant on Main Street, handily located for downtown walk-in traffic. Extensive renovations have removed all traces of the barbershop that once was there. The setting is one of contrasts: Sophisticated art posters adorn rough, unfinished wood walls. A dining area - marked by cane-seated Breuer chairs and handsome tables neatly napped in white cloths - adjoins a lively, somewhat noisy bar. If the bar could be screened off from the dining area, there would be more peaceful dining. As it is, willing but only semi-skilled waiters and waitresses bustle from bar to table to bar, adding to what at dinnertime can be a confusing scene. Lunch is quieter and, on the whole, provides greater culinary competence.
1984-06-17	SAMPLING THE FLAVORS OF INDIA	JHOOLA in Syosset, the western branch of a restaurant of the same name in Smithtown, opened about two months ago. Business appears to be slow so far. The location, off Jericho Turnpike in a mini-mall opposite an indoor tennis facility, cannot help. But if you are fond of or even curious about Indian food and would enjoy the variety of preparations including superb flat breads, unusual vegetable dishes and grilled specialties, Jhoola is well worth visiting. The entrance to the restaurant, through a corridor of small shops that gives the setting a bazaarlike atmosphere, is agreeable enough in daytime. But in the evening, when the shops are closed, it becomes a bit dismal. Never mind. The restaurant itself is pleasant, with bright red tablecloths, light wood and white stucco walls. It would be even more attractive if the linens were less wrinkled. The menu is extremely varied, and since the dishes are served family style, it is easy to share and sample a variety of tastes.
1984-06-10	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Workshoes, Boots And Cream Puffs Knapp Shoes, begun 70 years ago with door-to-door sales of its own footwear, has come to be a nationally known label with 80 retail outlets. The manufacturer sells its own dress and casual shoes, Western boots, workshoes and workboots, high rubber boots for fishermen or firemen and red-soled rubbers for wear at construction sites. It also has authorized steel-toe safety shoes and boots for men and women. The company- owned Yonkers shop on Central Avenue just below the Cross County Center opened 21 years ago and a franchised shop is in Bedford Hills - the prices are the same.

 For this month, Knapp has a special it calls a 7-11 sale: for all workshoes priced at less than $50, $7 is deducted at the cash register, and for workshoes more than $50 the automatic deduction is $11. Certain workshoes and boots have a guaranteed sole in an arrangement called a two- shot: the sole and heel are guaranteed to outlast the top, or the shoes are replaced at no charge for as long as the shoe is owned. There is no time limit, but the offer is good only on the first pair."
1984-06-10	"DINING OUT;
FROM THE KITCHENS OF KOREA"	"DESPITE Korea's proximity to China and Japan, the Koreans have held on to their own culture, traditions and cuisine. Although many dishes somewhat resembled Japanese, Chinese and Mongolian foods, the overall impression is of both sweeter and lustier flavors. 

 Not as refined as the Japanese nor, apparently, as varied as the Chinese, still several ingredients are shared, such as soy sauce, rice, ginger, red pepper, sesame oil, scallions and heavy doses of garlic. But Korea's own is kim chee, the peppery, garlicky fermented cabbage used both as a condiment and a flavoring."
1984-06-10	A 'CHATEAU' WITH A VIEW TO MATCH	CHATEAU LA MER in Lindenhurst opened last New Year's Eve. Calling it a chateau is not overstating. The restaurant, which commands a spectacular view of Great South Bay from a soaring expanse of plate glass windows, is grand in every dimension. The spacious main dining room is circular, its central axis a skylight beneath which a towering ficus tree strung with sparkling lights has been positioned. It's better not to think about what it must cost to heat the place in winter. The windows arch around half the room.
1984-06-10	WHERE TO BREAKFAST IN WESTPORT	and many attribute it to the influx of corporate headquarters in the area - dining out at breakfast time has become something of a trend in some Fairfield County towns. This is particularly noticeable in Westport. To be sure, there are places in other towns where the knowledgeable early riser can find a morning cup of coffee and croissant. But Westport's compact, lively Main Street is dotted with several pleasant places where you can breakfast happily alone or with a friend or colleague. For someone on a tight schedule, breakfast is a pleasant time to have a quick visit without the time commitment involved in a lengthier meal.
1984-06-03	AMERICAN FARE, HISTORIC SETTING	ON balance, it probably makes more sense for the authentically historic George Washington Manor in Roslyn to be run by the people who own the Milleridge Inn in Jericho than for it to be turned into a Franco-Mexican restaurant serving pizza, as it was a few years ago. The Milleridge Inn style preserves the Colonial integrity, although in theme park fashion. The 18th-century mansion has been tastefully decorated. Some antiques and reproductions are placed about the spacious entry, and the main dining room, in pale blue, has bare wide-plank floors, Windsor chairs and pewter on display on the mantel and in breakfronts. Tables are set with floral- patterned dinnerware appropriate to the period.
1984-05-27	"DINING OUT ;
MADISON: NO LACK OF RESTAURANTS"	"THE Morris County borough of Madison has become something of a center for interesting dining of late. An eclectic cluster of engaging restaurants has opened there, including Cook Plaza Cafe (which, by the way, has just changed hands), Four Seas, Sonia Rose and, one of the most attractive of the lot, L'allegria.

 Situated in a converted old house just off Main Street, L'allegria has a cozy, plant-filled dining room with nicely set tables on two levels. Skylights, old brick walls and tile floors add to the al fresco look; however, the hard edges also contribute to the high noise level on busy days."
1984-05-27	"DINING OUT;
NEW IN ARMONK,POSTCARD CAFE"	"FILLING the need for a restaurant that serves moderately priced fresh food - from snacks to full dinners - The Postcard Cafe, a small, new arrival in Armonk, is worth knowing about even in its present fledgling state. It is full of youthful enthusiasm that begins in the dining room with barn-red walls and ceiling, bare wood tables, pressed-tin wainscoting and a mounted collection of interesting postcards and that ends in the impetuous kitchen. Full of verve and promise, this kitchen has clearly good intentions; but it needs to cultivate patience and finesse. At times, the cooking was terrific, the inventiveness impressive. Other times, however, mistakes reached the dining room - unseasoned food, poorly balanced sauces, ill-conceived dishes - that put into question whether the chef had time or inclination to taste some of the fare.

 But there were successful dishes enough for the crowd that packed the restaurant on a recent weekend evening. Brie baked in a flaky crust and sparkling fresh Norwegian salmon made appealing starters as did tossed salad of duck, Chinese cabbage and sesame oil and a creamy lobster bisque, redolent of the crustacean. A loose-textured chicken liver and brandy p^ate was nicely flavored with tarragon; but crisp, plump shrimp deserved better than a mouth-puckering, lemon-thinned catsup sauce."
1984-05-27	A POULAR BUT NOISY LUNCH SPOT	HOW you like Breakaway in Fairfield depends on how you feel about dining in crowded, noisy, smoky places. What this wildly popular eatery has going for it is reasonably good food, a menu with frequently changing specials and some imaginative creations, and outrageously vivid decor. But fair warning: There are no reservations and the small dining area can get frantic at peak dining hours. In fact, you will skip dinner here entirely if you cannot bear a half-hour wait for a table at peak times, standing two or three deep in an equally small, smoke-and-music filled bar. On the other hand, if you like to ''hang out,'' Breakaway seems to be the place for it.
1984-05-27	JAPANESE FOOD, FRIENDLY SERVICE	HIZEN, in Levittown, looks as if it might have been cut from the same mold as most of the other Japanese restaurants on the Island. The dining room is simply done, with some decorative light wood panels and dividers, paper lanterns, boldly printed fabric hangings and functional light wood tables, chairs and booths. There is a sushi bar along one wall. The menu is also typical, divided into categories according to the way the entrees are prepared. And as in the majority of Japanese restaurants, the food is fresh, attractively presented and well-prepared.
1984-05-26	'BACK ROOM' FOR CHARGE CARDS	With Americans' growing use of credit cards, a company based in Omaha has been able to carve out what industry analysts describe as a ''nice little business'' handling Visa and Mastercard transactions - some 445 million last year alone. That has made First Data Resources Inc. the largest independent processor of bank card charges. Now, building upon the technology developed in that area, First Data is branching out into telemarketing, cable system services, cash management and computer maintenance. ''It makes sense, because once you've made your fixed investment in your computerized plant, expansion carries little risk,'' said one analyst who asked not to be identified. ''Those additional revenues drop 100 percent to the bottom line. It makes the company an interesting investment.''
1984-05-20	"DINING OUT;
MIDDLE EAST COMES TO HOPEWELL"	"THERE'S a Middle Eastern restaurant called Casablanca on a lonely road in Hopewell. If you have the good fortune to look like a young Ingrid Bergman, and you decide to pay a visit some Friday or Saturday evening, Donival Brown, the restaurant's pianist, may play ''As Time Goes By'' on the white upright. However, the only Humphrey Bogart you will find is on a poster. 

 Despite its plain brick exterior, the interior of the restaurant is surprisingly attractive. There are arched doorways, decorative wrought-iron railings, small oriental rugs on the walls, rattan-edged chairs with print fabric insets, white cloths, damask napkins and fresh flowers on the tables."
1984-05-20	SAVING - A MATTER OF PSYCHOLOGY	"TO be financially secure, experts say, you need a regular plan for saving and investing, not just a good job. The savings provide the cushion for emergencies and allow you to achieve such long- term goals as financing the children's education or your own retirement. But many people have a psychological block against saving: more than others, they have difficulty putting aside something from each paycheck. 

 Psychologists and financial experts alike say that these people - and they range from blue-collar workers to the most affluent professionals - tend to shy away from setting the goals, making the budgetary choices and taking the responsibilities that saving entails, often spending everything they make instead.

''I recently got a call from a Galveston secretary making $22,000 who said she could barely make ends meet,'' said George E. L. Barbee, executive director of the Consumer Financial Institute in Newton, Mass. ''The same day I got a call from a doctor in California making $151,000 who said, in whispered tones, that he could barely make ends meet.''"
1984-05-20	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Window Treatments And Wall Coverings The seventh yearly window-treatment sale at Motif Designs in Larchmont is being extended to May 26 - with 50 percent off on Levolor miniblinds; 40 percent off vertical blinds, woven woods, Roman, Austrian and roll-up shades; and 25 percent off pre- finished and finished shutters. Reminders on sales can be by means of the yearly calendar of events and by specific mailings to customers who sign the guest book or phone to ask to be included.

 Motif Designs is a manufacturer and a distributor in one part of the business, and under the same name designs three wall-covering and fabric collections for Marimekko: Rosie 1 and Rosie 2, with Wamsutta producing the bedding component. Whimsical Walls is the collection that includes ''Stars'' patterns in both primary colors and pastels, useful for children's rooms as well as other areas."
1984-05-20	GOOD VALUE AND FRIENDLY STAFF	-MEX and Cal-Mex, American versions of Mexican cooking, have been wending their way to the Northeast for a dozen years. There has been no stampede, to be sure, but interest continues. Sloppy Jose's in Milford is a small, homey establishment that has been in a villa-like, white-painted building for about eight years. The interior is reminiscent of similar places in the Southwest, with white plastered walls, a terra cotta tile floor, Roman arched windows edged in brick, a colorful mural of Mexican village life along one wall, and several over-sized sombreros as wall decor. A welcoming fire burns in the rustic fireplace on chilly evenings.
1984-05-20	BANKERS' GREY: COLOR IT LIVELY	IT was 10:30 on a cold, wintry night when a Manhattanite decided to play with his newest electronic toy, home banking. So, he pulled out his Atari computer, plugged it into his television set, then into his phone jack and dialed HomeBase, Citibank's home-banking program. Soon, records of the checks that had cleared his account were flashing before him, letting him know just where he stood, financially at least. But there was a bit of a scare. The account showed about $2,400 less than the customer thought he had. ''Keep calm,'' he told himself, ''obviously, it will easily be cleared up.'' But, knowing banks, he was going to have a restless night. By 11:30 P.M. - just before walking his dog in the first real snowstorm of the winter - the customer, growing more anxious, phoned HomeBase. Late as it was, someone answered. The error was quickly found - a $2,400 check had cleared the bank, but for some unexplained reason it did not show up on the screen. Consumer banking clearly is not what it used to be. At best, it has become an incongruous mixture of computerization, communications and the personal touch. At its worst, it has become expensive, impersonal and has pushed many lower-income people out of the banking system and back to the mattress.
1984-05-20	CREDIT CARDS - THE KEY TO EXPANDING SERVICES	FOR better or worse, depending on your luck in getting credit, the 600 million cards floating around in American wallets are becoming electronic keys, capable of unlocking a dizzying array of services. Indeed, for consumers, the rush by American Express, Diners' Club, MasterCard and Visa, among others, to expand the utility of their cards is somewhat bewildering. It is no longer a simple task to determine what kinds of services and limitations each card carries, much less what types of cards most people need. ''Services are definitely getting better,'' said H. David Meyers, chairman of the board of Timesaver Inc., one of the largest marketers of the Visa and MasterCard credit cards. ''But they are also getting more confusing.''
1984-05-20	BUILDING A CREDIT HISTORY: PROCEEDING WITH CAUTION	ONLY people who do not need credit can get it, or so the saying goes. The sheer number of banks attests to the falsity of that axiom. Indeed, at some point in life, virtually everybody needs credit, and most people are able to get it. But establishing a credit rating - and using credit judiciously - can require some preparation and understanding. Students, new entrants to the work force and recently divorced women (if they have failed to establish a credit history distinct from that of their husbands) in particular may have difficulty getting credit. ''It's a 'Catch-22' situation,'' said Elizabeth S. Lewin, a financial planner. Writing in ''Your Personal Financial Fitness Program,'' she noted, ''You can't get credit until you prove you can be depended on to pay your debts, and you can't prove you can pay your debts until someone takes the risk of extending credit to you.'' Banks prefer a borrower to have worked at one job for at least six months. ''What we're looking for is stability of employment,'' said Michael Wright, vice president of consumer finance for Goldome, a leading New York savings bank. When there is no employment record, no income and no credit history, a lender may insist on a co-signer. The co-signer - usually a relative - agrees to be liable for the debt, but the borrower's name goes on the account and he or she thus begins to establish a credit history.
1984-05-13	THE SPECIALS REALLY ARE	WESLEY'S, in Greenwich, like a number of other restaurants, is a different restaurant by day than by night. The nighttime persona is preferable. At dinner, subtle lighting casts a romantic glow, softening the look of what by day is a rather plain, U-shaped dining area, decorated in gray and red. The renovated interior of a 19th-century brickmill, once the American Felt Company, has been simply but handsomely executed. Wide windows allow viewing a waterfall and stylized pieces of felt are used attractively as decoration to remind you of the building's origins. Taped classical music provides a low backdrop for conversation. By day, rock music blares, making conversation at certain tables near the speakers all but impossible. ''Can you turn the music down a little, please?'' brought a terse, one-word response from our waiter: ''No.'' This confirmed what we have sometimes suspected elsewhere, that music is often played to satisfy the staff, not the patrons.
1984-05-13	A GRACEFUL SETTING, A VARIED MENU	VIOLETTE'S in Great Neck recently expanded into adjacent quarters and has reopened, now double its original size. The architectural contemporary look with geometric accent panels has been retained, and the atmosphere remains gracefully informal. Some particularly pleasant tables are set into alcoves. It is just the sort of restaurant to have in the neighborhood for a meal that can be light or more filling, selected from a varied menu of popular American- Continental specialties. The lengthy menu is divided into appetizers, hamburgers, pasta, salad plates, entrees, desserts and exotic coffees. Portions are substantial, the presentation is generally attractive and the cooking is competent if occasionally the food is underseasoned. That criticism does not apply to the clams casino, tender littlenecks baked on the half- shell with a patch of bacon and an abundant garlic and parsley topping, but it is accurate in the case of the onion soup. The potato skins, another appetizer, are prepared with a strip of bacon and a gluey melt of American cheese, neither of which garnish is a welcome addition.
1984-05-06	"DINING OUT;
A ONE-OF-A-KIND IN ATLANTIC CITY"	"JOHAN'S is the restaurant I recommend when asked where to eat in Atlantic City. I don't recommend it because the price is low (it isn't) or the food exquisite (it isn't), but because dining at Johan's is an experience that cannot be duplicated in many restaurants. 

 Johan's occupies a white-stucco building that gives every impression of being a private home. Inside are several small, intimate dining rooms capable of seating no more than 24 people in all. The decor is Edwardian, the predominant color is a deep rose-pink and the black-coated waiters are discreet and very good at their jobs."
1984-05-06	CONTROLLING THE PURSE STRINGS ABROAD	THE recent strength of both the United States economy and the dollar suggests that sizable numbers of Americans will once again be traveling abroad in the summer vacation months. And for many of them, the most bewildering part of their journey will be the process of changing their dollars into the local coin of the realm. For those who haven't been abroad in a few years, perhaps the most important financial news is the increasing acceptance of American credit cards. You may think you've discovered that exotic little island, but chances are that intrepid representatives of American Express and Diners Club have already been there and signed up a host of local hotels, restaurants and merchants. And no matter how exotic the names of the local bank charge plans, if you look closely, you'll see familiar emblems indicating an affiliation with Visa or Mastercard. Carte Bleu in France and Barclaycard in Britain are both Visa affliliates, for example, while in much of Europe, Access and Eurocard are Mastercard affiliates.
1984-05-06	TRAVEL ADVISORY: PAYING BILLS IN JAMAICA, SALUTE TO A NOVELIST	Jamaica Curbs Purchases In U.S. Dollars In Jamaica, where $1.75 in Jamaican currency was worth one United States dollar a few years ago, two recent devaluations have brought the exchange rate to roughly $3.51 to the United States dollar. Along with that favorable news for visitors from the United States comes word that tourists are now required to pay their bills in Jamaican dollars ( ). This ends a system under which tourists paid for accommodations, meals and liquor in United States currency and used Jamaican currency in supermarkets, taxis and crafts fairs. The exclusion of United States currency from circulation is designed to insure that the impact of devaluation will be reflected in the island's economy. (Credit cards will continue to be honored in lieu of cash.) To facilitate currency exchange on Jamaica, exchange bureaus offering the same rates as banks are being set up in hotels, at the Montego Bay and Kingston airports and on cruise ships.
1984-05-06	A COMMENDABLE NEW SPOT	WHEN it comes to Gregory's, small is beautiful. Gregory's in Fairfield is the kind of new restaurant you root for. The decor is deceptively simple. Inside a small storefront is a narrow interior of soft lights, white banquettes along one wall, framed fruit engravings on white walls and a single strand of orchids on each neatly napped table. A friendly, well-trained staff expertly serves from a small menu of carefully prepared (for the most part) and unpretentious dishes. These are endearing elements in a restaurant. Gregory's has a number of things going for it, not the least of which is the food. The cooking style is eclectic, with elements of nouvelle cuisine and the informality of the new California cooking.
1984-05-06	THE NEW LOOK IS ART DECO	AT the beginning of last summer, the restaurant in the Long Island Hotel in Center Moriches opened with a new look, a new menu and a new chef. The new look is actually a studied old look, a romantic interpretation of 1930's Art Deco with black, gray and white tile floors, lots of pink and gray, potted palms and mirrors. The flattering pinkish glow from ceiling spots and plain wooden chairs in random pastel shades around the tables draped in pink complete the stylish ensemble. A clever decorator thought of placing, here and there, old porch columns painted white, an accent that is at once retro and chic.
1984-05-04	RESTAURANTS	THE CAPTAIN'S TABLE, a small, frenetically busy restaurant at the corner of Second Avenue and 46th Street, has specialized in American- and Mediterranean-accented fish dishes since it opened six years ago. While the wondrous variety of local and imported fish is still impressive, some of it tantalizingly displayed at the entrance, the details that make the difference between an excellent restaurant and a very good one have been lost. This is surprising because the owners, Gino and Sabine Musso, have sold the original Captain's Table in Greenwich Village and should be able to give full attention to their uptown establishment. When they do, the results are superb. Any restaurant that can cook delicate fish like loup de mer and monkfish to perfection should be equally adept at anything it sets its mind to. Thus, the lapses at the Captain's Table are hard to forgive and the restaurant can no longer sustain the three-star rating it previously received in The New York Times.
1984-05-03	Credit-Card Shift by Bank	First City Bancorp of Texas Inc., one of the state's largest issuers of Visa and Mastercards, said it would move its credit-card operations to South Dakota to escape Texas's restrictions on interest rates and fees. Mike Gatewood, a First City senior vice president, said that Texas laws do not allow it to be competitive with out-of-state institutions that market credit cards in Texas.
1984-04-29	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"From Bridal Gowns To Jogging Togs The Corner Closet opened in White Plains eight years ago with nationally advertised and designer clothing for the corporate woman, for all seasons and all occasions - including weddings - and prom, graduation and cotillion dresses for daughters. Sizes are 3 to 15-16, and other sizes can be ordered. There are some 15 or 20 percent discounted and sale items in the shop and sale racks have winter and some summer items at 50 to 75 percent off to clear.

 Wedding dresses begin at $250 or $300 and can be as high as $800, no charge for alterations, and hats, veils and bridal party dresses are also displayed. There is a registry for graduation or prom gowns to try to insure having the sole example of a particular dress and simple hem, strap or waist elastic changes can be arranged at no charge - more complex adjustments can be done at cost."
1984-04-29	PLEASANT ROADSIDE FARE	Appearances can be deceptive, goes the old cliche, and rarely is this truer than in dining out. Case in point is Claire's Countryside Cafe in Branford, a small, unprepossessing one- story building on a strip lined with fast food eateries. The bustling, wood-paneled dining space is simply furnished with wooden booths, tables and captain's chairs, and cafe curtains with wooden half-shutters over small windows. A windowed wall opens the busy kitchen to diners' view. But the food is freshly prepared, often with imaginative flourishes, the baking is fresh and on the whole excellent, and the service is personal, unharried (despite the busyness) and professional. Prices are disarmingly modest. All in all, this is a pleasant place to stop for lunch or dinner.
1984-04-29	Dining; CHINESE CUISINE IN A TUDOR SETTING	-style building - white stucco with dark trim - repaint some of the trim in red, add a pagoda- roofed sign and you have transformed it into a new, elaborate Chinese restaurant in Glen Cove called Golden Woks. The Oriental decoration is more subdued in the interior, where heavy, dark beams and massive stone fireplaces still dominate. Some Chinese scrolls and statuary have been added here and there, as have the light wood, cane and chrome Marcel Breuer-style chairs that suddenly seem to have become necessary in new Chinese restaurants. The menu is fairly typical of the more luxurious Chinese dining establishments (as opposed to the storefronts that specialize in take-out). Hot and cold appetizers and a listing of the more complex and expensive ''chef's specialties'' are followed, in the back, by a catalogue of many of the other dishes one is likely to find in Chinese restaurants these days, from ma po spicy bean curd to moo shu pork to chicken chow mein.
1984-04-22	ITALIAN IN DOWNTOWN NEW HAVEN	AS bacon is to eggs, Italian restaurants are to New Haven. What makes Paolo's different is its location in the center of the city, near the Yale campus and a block from the Yale Repertory Theater, not in the Italian area around Wooster Street. Paolo's proximity to the theater may be responsible for the staff's awareness of time. Our waiters, on separate occasions, asked if we were ''trying to make a curtain,'' explaining that certain dishes required more time. Service, theatergoing or not, is swift and skilled.
1984-04-22	A NEW CHEF WITH FINESSE	GUIDO'S in Cedarhurst is a fairly new Italian restaurant that presents an informal, contemporary stylishness. Its polished blond wood furnishings, bar and trim are set against a background of hunter green carpeting, green plaid tablecloths with dark green napkins (unfortunately made of sleazy synthetic fabric), plants and accents of shiny brass. In the early months of operation, the menu included crisp-crusted, excellent pizza, with assorted toppings. It was served only as an appetizer at dinner, but there are few restaurants on the Island where one could enjoy pizza in as attractive a setting. The menu was changed about a month ago, and pizza no longer appears on it. According to the owner, it can still be ordered and he plans to have separate cards listing it, but during our recent visits there was no way of knowing it was available. Our waiter and waitress never mentioned it.
1984-04-15	ITALIAN RESTAURANTS: ENDLESS LIST	"HUNDREDS of Italian restaurants of widely varying degrees of quality abound in New Jersey. From stylish dining rooms with topnotch kitchens that would compare favorably with those in Manhattan all the way down to glorified pizza parlors with little to recommend them besides their moderate prices, there is an Italian spot for every palate and purse. 

 A new entrant in the state's marinara marathon is Borghese, a six-month-old venture in Berkeley Heights, near Summit, which is running well back in the pack at this early stage. 

Borghese's informal atmosphere is modern and upbeat, with butcher-block tables (with napkins serving as place mats), cane chairs and smoked- glass chandeliers. A long bar lines one side of the room. When the candlelit tables are filled anywhere near their capacity of 100 diners, the restaurant can be noisy."
1984-04-15	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
A Universe of Yarns At Discount Prices"	"Goldman's Yarns has been in Hartsdale for the last eight years, but reflects 55 years of retailing experience with knitting and crocheting yarns, pattern selection and adjustment for fitting, needlework and crewel, rug hooking for floors, walls and soft toys and floss and embroidery kits for permanent-press tablecloths. Everything is discounted 15 to 30 percent from suggested list prices, and winter clearances, specials and discontinued lines mean further markdowns.

Winter closeouts of an additional 10 percent off include three colors of Chat Botte, or Pussy Cat, formerly $5.25 for a mohair and acrylic skein, and Laine de Zelande in muted lavender or olive, a Dutch product formerly $5.98 a ball. Rhumba was sold earlier at $2.75 and a French wool by Dore that was $6.98 has a fine strand of silver along the gray or the red and a touch of gold threaded along the white strands - just right for holiday or dressy sweaters."
1984-04-15	INDIAN AROMAS AT THE MALL	COMBINE handsome Indian decor with authentic ethnic cooking, add a soup,con of Indian music, the aroma of exotic spices, and presto, you have the recipe for an irrestible new restaurant. Shamiana is a surprise. From the austere walkways of the Stamford Town Center shopping mall, you step into the vibrant colors, sound and aromas of India. In relatively small space, this artfully designed new restaurant uses genuine folk art, an appliqued canopy (the name Shamiana means festive tent) over a cleverly partitioned inner section, and a wall lined with huge glass jars of the fragrant herbs and spices of Indian cooking to create a sequestered retreat for shoppers and other diners. Though service can be slow and scattered, it is generally helpful.
1984-04-15	Dining Out ; A 'DIFFERENT' JAPANESE RESTAURANT	ALTHOUGH it may not be evident to the average patron of Ginza of Tokyo, a new Japanese restaurant in Syosset, this is a rather uncommon enterprise. The restaurant is owned by Homer Lee, who has three Chinese restaurants elsewhere on the Island. A few unusual items are served at Ginza, including the Chinese steamed dumplings, shumai. That is the only Chinese dish, but the luncheon menu also includes combination platters that are more typical in Chinese than in Japanese restaurants.
1984-04-09	SIC THE FEDS ON CREDIT-CARD CROOKS	The next time you pay for a meal or a suit with a credit card, think about ripping out the carbons from the credit form and tearing them up. Messy? You bet. But the consequences if you don't could be even messier.
1984-04-08	AUTHENTIC MEXICAN TOUCHES	AS you walk up the entrance ramp to El Acapulco in South Norwalk, there is the suggestion of a fast-food eatery in the large, brightly lighted room with sturdy, inexpensive wooden chairs, laminated tabletops and plastic placemats. But this, fortunately, is not the case. El Acapulco may be one of the few Mexican restaurants in the area that is a bona fide family- run establishment. Several years ago, the restaurant opened on the other side of Washington Street, then moved to Route 7, but is now back, in one of the newly renovated buildings along the street.
1984-04-01	A FAMILY-RUN INN IN SAYVILLE	-star restaurant with two-star potential. The menu of Italian, French, Continental, new American and Oriental specialties is extremely lengthy and ambitious, so it is not surprising that the preparation can be inconsistent. Although the cooking is serious and done to order, seasonings have been off-base at times, a number of the ingredients could stand improvement and the presentation is sometimes clumsy. This year-and-a-half-old family-run restaurant resembles many of the better roadside restaurant- bars that dot the Island's highways. About half the beam-trimmed building is occupied by the bar, which seems to enjoy a steady clientele and where a singer entertains on weekends. The dining room is paneled in dark wood, hung with mediocre art, carpeted with a pattern that cannot decide whether to be floral or brick and furnished with well- spaced, properly but not stylishly appointed tables.
1984-04-01	THE 'HOT' ITEMS REALLY ARE	HUNAN GARDEN is fast becoming a new industry, with branches in Greenwich, Westport, Stamford and now Norwalk. What makes this small group different from a chain is that there seems to be considerable autonomy from location to location, suggesting that the chef in each place contributes his own special style. The new Norwalk restaurant is the first to use waitresses, and, judging by our experience, it is a pleasant innovation. This Hunan Garden has acquired the space formerly occupied by the now defunct Mandarin East - two large rooms, with beige bamboo wallpaper, a few Chinese paintings and several incongruous crystal chandeliers.
1984-04-01	SOCIAL SECURITY, CREDIT AND I.R.A.'S	Following are answers to some questions from readers of the Personal Finance column. Q. I have a 69-year-old aunt who worked steadily as a practical nurse for the last 35 years. She believes she is not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits because she did not work between the ages of 61 and 65. Is she right?
1984-03-31	CHEMICAL BID CREDIT-CARD UNIT	The Chemical Bank has won the bid for the credit-card business of the Continental Illinois Corporation, the banks announced yesterday. The acquisition represents a major shift in Chemical's consumer-banking strategy, at a cost of almost $1 billion, The deal gives Chemical almost 1.2 million card holders and $800 million in loans outstanding on the cards. As a result, Chemical suddenly becomes the fourth- or fifth-largest issuer of bank credit cards in the United States. Chemical, the nation's sixth-largest banking company, previously ranked No. 21, with only 400,000 card holders. The $1 billion included about $800 million in loans outstanding to holders of Continental's Mastercard and Visa credit cards, plus a premium of $176 million.
1984-03-29	CONTINENTAL ILLINOIS: CREDIT CARD BIDS	Bankers yesterday were eagerly awaiting the outcome of an auction of the Continental Illinois Corporation's credit-card operations, the fifth largest in the country. The deadline for bids was Tuesday, and a spokesman for the bank said the buying interest was ''heavy.'' Only the Bank of America acknowledged that it was among the bidders. Several officials at other banks, however, said that they viewed the credit card as the most efficient vehicle in the push for interstate banking and indicated that Continental was offering a high-quality portfolio.
1984-03-28	CREDIT CARD SURCHARGE BAN GAINS	A House of Representatives subcommittee voted today to extend a ban on credit card surcharges until May 31, 1985. Such a ban had been in effect until Feb. 27, when a temporary measure expired. Even before today's committee action, the House and the Senate passed bills temporarily extending the ban - in the House's version to July 31 and in the Senate's to May 15 - but they are different and the two houses have been unable to reach agreement on one bill. As a result, merchants are legally free to impose the surcharge, but few have done so.
1984-03-27	Talking Business; Fighting Fraud In Credit Cards	Credit card fraud has grown significantly, and banks all over the United States have been taking steps to reduce it. One of the leaders in this effort is the Bank of New York. Last November it became the first bank in New York City to make available the new Mastercards with built-in safety features. The bank also issues Visa cards. Peter Herrick, president of the bank, guided the institution in its fight against abuses in the credit card field. Mr. Herrick, who is also first vice president of the New York State Bankers Association and vice chairman of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York, discussed this situation yesterday in a telephone interview.
1984-03-25	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Anniversary Sale On the Road Westchester Road Runner in White Plains is celebrating its fourth birthday in April with an anniversary sale, but until then the winter clearance has dropped some prices to 20 to 60 percent off the retail charge. One sale rack contains long- and short-sleeved shirts and warm-up jackets and pants, all at 40 percent off.

 The shop's running club sponsors 20 races a year, including the Titicus Road Races, the Galleria Run, the Westchester Triathlon and the Bronx Safari Run at the zoo in May for children in first through sixth grade only. Flyers are available on the April 15 kilometer run sponsored by the Scarsdale Recreation Department and the Scarsdale Antiques, or other county and New York City events, for anyone providing self-addressed envelopes. Membership in the Athletics Congress, a prerequisite for the marathon and other major races, can be arranged here with entry numbers given on the spot."
1984-03-25	THAI FOOD: TANTALIZINGLY EXOTIC	YOU could say that Siam Palace in Port Washington is the best Thai restaurant on the Island as long as you limit the definition of the Island to Nassau and Suffolk Counties and do not include Queens. Siam Palace may be the only restaurant in this area serving the aromatically pungent, complex and interesting cuisine of Thailand with its combination of fiery hot, sharply acidic or sweetly mellow flavors. This small but attractive and friendly restaurant is very moderately priced and certainly worth trying if you are unfamiliar with this tantalizingly exotic cooking. But there are compromises here. Seasoning is generally timid even when requested ''medium hot'' and while that aspect may appeal to many people, it does not fully represent the range of spicing that Thai food can achieve. The use of parsley as a garnish instead of coriander and in seafood combinations and the addition of surimi, the crablike product that is manufactured from fish and is used more and more in restaurants, are disappointments.
1984-03-23	A COZY INN WITHOUT THE CLICHES	THE Bee and Thistle in Old Lyme may be the quintessential New England inn. Its two parlors are cozy, with couches facing wood-burning fireplaces in each. Two dining rooms and a small closed-in porch are simply furnished with ladderback chairs, soft wall-sconce lighting and neatly napped tables. But the menu is more original and compelling than the old-fashioned cut-glass cottage cheese- and-relish tray cliches that epitomized country inns of the past.
1984-03-18	A TRATTORIA TO REMEMBER	LA PETITE TRATTORIA in Lynbrook is a modest storefront restaurant. It may not be worth traveling halfway across the Island to dine here, but if you are in the area, it is a good place to remember for a special meal. It has a surprisingly ambitious menu. The simpler home-style preparations are generally better than the more elaborate Continental specialties, however. These pretentious dishes often involve the kind of complex sauce making that this kitchen does not have the expertise to accomplish with finesse. Some of the dishes also call for combinations of ingredients that may sound creative but do not work some of the time, especially when they are canned fruits or vegetables.
1984-03-18	THREE STARS, AND WORTH IT	THERE is a feeling of jubilation in finding that a restaurant that was very good when it opened has become even better in the ensuing five years. The Homestead Inn, in a renovated Victorian house in Greenwich, had much to recommend it from the start: two gracefully decorated dining rooms (located where the barn, the grange, once stood) with fireplaces and a cheerful, glassed-in dining porch made a comfortable setting for an ambitious, somewhat different French menu. At its best it could soar. But a certain tentativeness, some false starts in the kitchen and uneven service characterized the inn's restaurant, La Grange, for several years.
1984-03-16	RESTAURANTS	Cognoscenti and would-be cognoscenti have been flocking to Jams on the Upper East Side for the last six weeks, eager to be among the first to sample the California cuisine they have heard so much about. For the untutored, New York's first restaurant to offer this minimalist style of cooking in a minimalist setting may come as something of a shock. At $25 for a small piece of fish and some vegetables, New Yorkers expect something more elaborate, but in many ways the simplicity of the dishes is even more exacting than haute cuisine. There is no place to hide the mistakes, and the chef, Jonathan Waxman, who owns the restaurant with Melvin Master, former director of the Jordan Winery, is not making many of them, as he refines the principles of a style he helped develop as executive chef at Michael's in Santa Monica. Still evolutionary, California cooking borrows from other cultures, but is rooted in the classical kitchen while acknowledging its debt to nouvelle cuisine. Food is served on oversize plates - on top of the sauces rather than under them. Preparation is based on brevity of cooking: meats and fish are quickly seared on a grill, often over mesquite; vegetables are poached or steamed, but just barely. The ingredients are chosen to heighten and balance, rather than to mask individual flavors.
1984-03-15	CREDIT CRAD DRIVES WOOING THE AFFLUENT	The swirling Congressional debate over credit card surcharges has focused attention on an industry that, more than ever, is looking for new ways to expand and reach higher-income customers. The three major cards, American Express, Visa and Mastercard, have all, for example, recently begun national advertising campaigns, stressing their versatility and aimed directly at the luxury travel and entertainment market. Of the three, American Express, for now, is probably the most aggressive marketer. The simple reason is that American Express is not yet the king of the credit card heap.
1984-03-14	CREDIT CARD CONCERN WILL MOVE ITS OFFICES FROM THE CITY TO L.I.	First Card Services Inc., the last major credit card operation in New York City, will move its offices and its 400 employees to Long Island next summer, company officials said yesterday. The company will be able to spend about 50 percent less in such ''occupancy costs'' as rent, taxes and utilities than if it had renewed its lease at 1775 Broadway, near 57th Street, the company's president said. First Card Services is a wholly owned subsidiary of the First National Bank of Chicago and serves more than a million Visa and MasterCard customers east of the Mississippi River.

CHINESE FARE NORTH OF THE BORDER"	"ALTHOUGH we rarely a visit a restaurant unless it has been recommended, we still eat many meals that we never bother to write about because it would be a waste of the space allotted to us on these pages. Recommendations from other food people are particularly valuable because they tend to view restaurants more objectively than the average person. 

 The Cathay Too, a Chinese restaurant in the Rockland County community of Suffern, N.Y., was first brought to our attention by a well-known New Jersey food writer and teacher who was born in China. It was she who accompanied us the first time, and who pre-ordered our first meal so that there was a mixture of tastes, textures and colors."
1984-03-11	PROSPECTS	The Credit-Buying Binge The American public has been on a credit-buying binge that is just beginning to show signs of weakening. Spurred on by the recovery, millions of consumers have been going into hock for basic and luxury goods. Sales of new sports cars, for example, have been brisk and so has installment buying of video cassette recorders and other leisure-time electronics devices. ''Consumers have had a voracious appetite for credit,'' said H. Erich Heinemann and Charles Lieberman, economists for Shearson/ American Express. The two noted that consumers have committed themselves for an additional $141.5 billion in outstanding credit over the last five quarters, ''mirroring the rise in consumer income and spending which has formed the backbone of the economic expansion.'' But the consumer credit figures for January - due out Wednesday - are likely to show that the credit spree is softening. The estimates are for an additional $5.5 billion (Shearson/American Express) to $6 billion (Merrill Lynch) in net consumer installment debt, compared with a rise of $6.62 billion in December. The reason for the softening? Some consumers have temporarily satisfied their needs, Mr. Lieberman said.
1984-03-11	Dining Out; A VISTA OF TWINKLING LIGHTS	I T may not be Windows on the World, but Burgundy's, the restaurant that opened last October in the North Shore Towers apartment complex in New Hyde Park, is a room with a view. It overlooks Queens and Nassau County, providing an attractive vista of twinkling lights at night. The surprising part is that the restaurant is in a basement arcade, not at the top of one of the buildings, but the view is possible because of the elevation of the land. Like Windows on the World, the dining room, with its expanse of windows, is built on different levels separated by brass railings and arranged to take advantage of the view. It is stylish, done in tones of rose pink and deep blue, but the table settings are oddly sparse. Once the hostess places your scarlet napkin on your lap for you (not the only note of pretension here), the absence of a service plate makes each place look bare.
1984-03-04	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Quality Wearables Up to 50% Off Carrig Isle in Bronxville is a quality women's sportswear and men's accessories shop, not a discount retailer, but at sale times prices can be as much as 50 percent off the original charges. The post-holiday sale still has limited quantities marked down of the shop's own and other labels until March 17 and the next price-cutting period is the Better Buy Bronxville Chamber of Commerce sidewalk sale June 23. Sizes are 4 to 12 and new spring items are not included in the present markdowns.

 Silk blouses, usually $95, are $47 or $66.50, depending on style or the type of pleating, and the cotton shirts include a choice from among paisley, checks, stripes and plaids. A knitted, long-sleeved white cotton sweater with crocheted detailing at the V-neck and floral insets, usually $88, drops to $66 now, and there are similar white vests."
1984-03-04	"DINING OUT;
NOUVELLE MODE GROWS IN ARMONK"	"COVINGTON is as chic as ever. Upstairs, intimately lighted and pastelled to a peachy pink, charming alcoves give the feel of dining in private rooms. Downstairs, an imported English bar, all dark woods and sparkling cut glass is for all the world a pub, which, we hear, assuages homesickness in Englishmen transplanted to this vicinity. Service, given our memory of haughty hostesses and smarmy waiters, was notably friendly and gracious at the door and efficient, knowledgeable and concerned at the tables.

 The kitchen, which started as a brilliant rookie but then was plagued by the sophomore jinx, is now directed by the chef Davis Barnes and reflects his own growing style and considerable strength in the nouvelle mode. Like other ambitious new-breed chefs, Mr. Barnes takes risks, and nothing was merely mediocre. Heavy victories made up for losses marked, for instance, by occasional overcooking but never by inferior ingredients. In fact, the high quality of fish, meats and vegetables made Covington's prices seem something of a bargain."
1984-03-04	FRESH SEAFOOD WITH SIMPLICITY	FISHTALES in Manhasset looks like a typical neighborhood pub or gathering place, but from the name you can correctly assume the emphasis on seafood rather than burgers and fried zucchini. What this restaurant may lack in atmosphere and elegance (tables are bare wood set with paper napkins and place mats that double as menus) is more than offset by its straightforward honesty, fresh food and very reasonable prices. A generous serving of fresh bluefish fillet, broiled to a turn with a light butter glaze and served with cole slaw, garlic bread, decently cooked broccoli and potatoes, was a mere $5.50 at dinner. A hefty, thick Norwegian salmon steak served with the same accouterments went for $11.95. At lunch, a deliciously meaty tilefish fillet was $5.95 ($8.95 for the somewhat larger dinner portion).
1984-03-04	A REPRIEVE FOR AN OLD FAVORITE	THERE are many people who remember the Red Barn when it was one of the few good culinary spots in Fairfield County and when its starched white linen and fresh flowers made it a favorite for Mother's Day and special occasions. Decline was gradual, but a visit several years ago was so dismal and the food so bad that we thought this 50-year-old Westport restaurant was truly at death's door. And so it was. But now it has been given a reprieve. New ownership, a new name - Nistico's Red Barn - and a complete refurbishing have made the old place look almost as good as new. Even the entrance sidewalk seems freshly laid. The old Stone Room's stone floor has given way to a floor that makes the room usable year-round. Other large dining areas have been made into smaller rooms. The big fieldstone double fireplace is one of the few familiar features. Each side faces a pretty, well-lighted room, highlighted with touches of pink in the napkins and scalloped draperies.
1984-02-28	CREDIT SURCHARGES HELD UNLIKELY BY RETAILERS	Retailers said yesterday that they would not impose a surcharge on credit sales, in the wake of the lifting of the ban on such charges. To do so, most said, would hurt credit sales, which represent at least 50 percent of their total business - and probably would draw strong, adverse reaction from consumers. As the law barring merchants from charging extra for credit purchases expired yesterday, a spot-check among both large and small retailers found virtually no positive sentiment for such an action. ''We are not considering a surcharge,'' a spokesman for Bloomingdale's, New York, said, ''but we don't think that the matter of not charging or charging for a credit sale should have been regulated in the first place. That should be left to the marketplace.''
1984-02-26	"DINING OUT;
OLD CHINESE SPOT AMONG THE NEW"	"P ENG'S GARDEN has had strong as well as weak moments since opening four-and- a-half years ago. The relatively small menu, based on Hunanese cuisine was unusual for the time, and promising. Since then, places declaring their allegiance to one region of China or another have inundated the county, and perhaps in the glow of their fresh dazzle, established restaurants seem pale and staid. However, recent visits to Peng's Garden suggested a rejuvenation. The kitchen turned out some snappy dishes.

 With its spiffy brown-and-white color scheme, this is one of the country's more formal ethnic dining rooms - contemporary and spacious, with comfortable chairs and generous banquettes. Service has recovered much of its early graciousness, although it is smoother on weekends when more English-speaking waiting staff is on deck. Not all the cooking is uniformly competent. It helps to make friends with your waiter. Our best dinner was orchestrated by one who tactfully pointed the way to a winning succession of dishes."
1984-02-26	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"For Umbrellas, An Open and Shut Place Zip Jack Custom Umbrella in Yonkers specializes in the manufacturing and repair of patio, chair, beach and rain designs. Emanuel Dubinsky, a co-owner, used to do all sorts of repairs on leather, suede and zippers beginning 35 years ago in the Bronx, but now the heart of this wholesale and retail business is working with decorators, designers and architects and doing the custom silk-screening on commercial orders, among them the Promenade Cafe at Rockefeller Center. Zip Jack also makes those ubiquitous Schweppes, Perrier, Kahlua and other beverage logos on umbrellas for restaurants and malls nationwide and sells them retail as well.

Mr. Dubinsky holds nine patents. One is on protective covers for umbrellas that slip on without anyone standing on the table and then zip closed, and the covers can be removed easily, too. He also is perfecting the Market Umbrella, modeled after those used in Italy in open-air markets. The first version, nine feet in diameter with eight ribs, is on a stand and costs $556. It has an all- wood frame, unbleached boat canvas cover and is easily opened by one person by means of a lift cord."
1984-02-26	FRENCH, APPEALING AND CREATIVE	M IRABELLE, a French country restaurant in St. James, opened a little over two months ago, and it has already become difficult to obtain a reservation on weekday evenings. All the tangible elements that one would like to think contribute to the success of a restaurant function beautifully here. The food is appealing, creative and carefully prepared and presented. It is obviously influenced by nouvelle cuisine without being precious. Service is accommodating and unpretentiously gracious. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the prices are fair. What else do you need? Just enough foresight to make your reservations in advance.
1984-02-20	HOLOGRAMS FIND MARKET ON MAGAZINES AND CARDS	In the right light, an eagle seems ready to fly off the cover of National Geographic's March issue, now being mailed to 10.5 million subscribers. And this spring, birthday salutations and images of ships and goldfish, among other things, will appear to float from a new line of Hallmark greeting cards. These are two of the newest uses of holography, the laser-based technology for creating graphics and images that appear to be three-dimensional. After years of unfulfilled promises, a new method of embossing now seems likely to broaden the appeal of holographic images for use in advertising, publishing and printing.

ITALIAN DINING IN WEST PATERSON"	"ASMALL shopping strip in a backwater of West Paterson is the unexpected setting for a handsome little restaurant offering enticing Italian food. Inside La Salandra's unprepossessing exterior is a snug bar with two or three tables for dining and a 24-seat dining room done in striking Art Deco style.

 The owners, Lorenzo and Mina La Salandra, opened the restaurant six months ago with the desire to offer upscale Italian dining. They hired Guy Offidani, a native of Trieste, and his son Raffael to man the kitchen; the former had been head chef at Manhattan's Romeo Salta for many years."
1984-02-19	A LIGHTENED CONTINENTAL STYLE	ABOUT two months ago, Your Place Or Mine moved from its homey little storefront in Franklin Square to larger, sleeker quarters in Wiliston Park. It is an extremely attractive restaurant with a contemporary point of view. The menu has been conceived along American or lightened Continental lines, and despite an occasional, surprising flaw, the food is generally well prepared. Service is attentive, and the atmosphere has a pleasantly comfortable elegance. The restaurant has four areas: a small bar, an enclosed dining room with glass doors, an octagonal skylight area with a few tables and, off to one side, another dining room. The color scheme is putty, accented with handsome embossed and cut-paper hangings.
1984-02-19	ON MAIN STREET IN BRONXVILLE	LE BRISTRO, for the last eight years a popular neighborhood restaurant on Bronxville's busy shopping street, has resisted the trend toward pubbiness. The pastel mural of balloons hovering over Paris rooftops remembered from our first visit five years ago remarks, as do the gay striped awnings. Relegated to the entry and first dining rooms, that look is now somewhat dated and unimaginative, but cozy nevertheless. Bar expenses of wall give a temporary feel to the back dining room, and a dead sweep of wood paneling bags for strip of mirror or some pictures for relief. The food on recent visits was decent. And although few dishes proved highly commendable, on the other hand few were deprecable.
1984-02-19	FOOD OF THE 80'S IN 40'S ATMOSPHERE	W hat do you make of a restaurant that looks like a 1940's hangout but serves 1980's nouvelle cuisine? Good question. But if you can stand pink, green and black decor in a spartan luncheonette setting, with a 1940's musical background, you'll find value - not quite 1940's, but good - and some interesting dishes at the Pink Flamingo. The name sounds like the 40's, and accentuating that idea - or spoof - is a table, suspended above the doorway, at which a couple of mannequins sit in vintage 40's clothing, with pink-lady type cocktails in hand. Amusing as the decor may be (or awful if one chooses not to be amused), the food is surprising. The small menu gives a choice of chicken, veal, beef, pasta or seafood prepared in intriguing ways.
1984-02-12	"DINING OUT;
NEW CHINESE SPOT FOR OSSINING"	"-KNOWN for its shops selling antiques at bargain prices, Ossining is becoming increasingly popular as visitors discover the houses and charm of the old riverside community, which is now being restored. The area has few restaurants that serve decent and reasonably priced food in an informal setting; thus the newly opened Southern Pavilion will be of interest to those who find themselves in that neighborhood. 

 Although the restaurant claims to specialize in Sichuan-Hunanese cooking, few of the dishes marked hot and spicy arrived that way. The food, conservatively seasoned, bore the mild flavors that distinguish Cantonese cooking. Be sure to insist upon heat and spiciness if you want it. Our rating reflects the averaging of some fine efforts with some disappointing ones from Southern Pavilion's lengthy menu. The kitchen may be overextending itself, but by ordering judiciously one can have a lovely meal."
1984-02-12	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Downhill Prices At Sports Sale Michels Ski Shop, which opened 28 years ago in the Cross County Shopping Center and added a mini-shop added in Dobbs Ferry six years ago, has advised its mailing list of a nearly storewide winter sport sale at 20 to 30 percent off, with selected items at up to 50 percent reductions. Names can be added to the list by card at either shop, or by telephone, for notice of seasonal sales. Men's, women's and children's clothing and equipment are carried at both shops, for both winter and summer wear.

 The shop in the Cross County Center will remain open all summer this year for the first time, newly stocked with running clothes and athletic footwear from New Balance, Saucony, Brooks and Etonic. Bathing suits and sailboards are also on hand and an arrangement has been made for sailboarding lessons through the Greentree Country Club in New Rochelle."
1984-02-12	A WELCOME NEW STEAKHOUSE	T HE massive, windowless gray concrete block structure on Glen Cove Road in Greenvale looks like the keep of a medieval castle, but it is Dar Tiffany, a new steakhouse. Instead of a moat, it is surrounded by a parking lot guarded by valets. It is named for one of the owners. From the ground-floor reception area, also of concrete block, a curving staircase carpeted in gray rises to the second-level dining areas. Mirrored walls suggest a space double in size. The dining room is comfortable and plush, attractively lighted and done in magenta and gray. A fairly low metallic ceiling does cause sound to reverberate. A large cocktail lounge adjoins the reception area downstairs.
1984-02-12	PLEASING FRENCH IN GREENWICH	I N a 1978 review of Cinquante Cinq, the small Greenwich restaurant merited three stars for its winning ways with French cuisine. Over the next couple of years, an occasional lunch or dinner reconfirmed our original appraisal. But it was four years since our last visit. Now, over the course of 10 recent meals, we have observed Cinquante Cinq rather closely. Our conclusions are that the restaurant's stardards rate two very good stars, though rarely soaring to three-star excellence.
1984-02-08	NOW BANK SELL THE TOASTERS	For years, banks have complained bitterly about how nonfinancial concerns, especially Sears, Roebuck & Company, have edged into the banking business, offering an increasingly wide range of consumer financial services. But at least two giant banks - Chemical Bank and Citicorp - have begun to strike back by selling a variety of merchandise through catalogues - the way Sears itself entered retailing. On Monday, Chemical began issuing catalogues that offer products supposedly at big discounts to its customers, based on the number of accounts they have at the bank. The more accounts, the cheaper the goods. The merchandise ranges from a pearl-and-diamond necklace, which the bank says is worth $12,000, to a Smoke Grabber ashtray that lists for $35.
1984-02-05	"DINING OUT;
CELEBRATING THE YEAR OF THE RAT"	"TO RING in the Year of the Rat, a visit to a Chinese restaurant in is order. Although Sun Lee Garden in the Wayne Hills Mall seems, at first glance, an unlikely setting for festive Chinese dining, a handful of very good dishes served there are cause enough for celebration. 

 This eight-month-old venture is in an obscure corner of the mall in what used to be a luncheonette, and it is still decorated, for the time being, in what is best described as ''Pancake House Plastic.'' 

But the news is that the chef and part owner is King Yee, who for several years was chief assistant chef at the late T.T. Wang's Shun Lee Palace in Manhattan. It is not Mr. Yee's intention to have a take-out chow mein shop, but to display his talents with a diverse offering (no fewer than 60 entrees are listed on the menu) of Hunanese, Szechuanese and Cantonese dishes."
1984-02-05	JAPANESE AMBIENCE IN FAIRFIELD	JAPANESE restaurants are sparsely planted in Connecticut's culinary soil. But those few seem to bloom and thrive as hardy perennials. Joining them is Mako of Japan, a winsome newcomer in Fairfield. It serves Japanese dishes at prices surprisingly inexpensive as Japanese restaurants go, in a modest setting. It is a real find.
1984-02-05	HOME STYLE AND GLATT KOSHER	A NUMBER of readers have written to recommend Jacob's Ladder in Cedarhurst for kosher food. The food is not only kosher but also glatt kosher, a term that is generally interpreted to mean extra kosher, but that in reality concerns the quality of the beef. Attention to certain details of kosher rules on the slaughtering of cattle is stricter if the meat is glatt kosher. Glatt kosher restaurants serve no dairy products. Kosher restaurants usually offer the home-style specialities that have evolved from European and especially Eastern European culinary traditions. Stuffed cabbage, kasha, knishes, potato pancakes, brisket of beef and tongue polonaise have become mainstays of this menu. Overstuffed sandwiches made with delicatessen meats and served on rye bread with pickles and cole slaw are another category typical of this fairly limited cuisine.
1984-01-29	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"How to Save Space - And Money, Too For those hoping to organize their home for the new year, help is at hand. Plastic Works! in New Rochelle is holding a space-saver promotion through Feb. 11. The space- saver system, called Cubix, has long been available for homes through architects and interior designers, but has been used most often by gift shops, art galleries and museums. Now it is available in the retail market. 

The components can be made into an entire wall of shelving or into cubes, tables, plant supports, etag eres and television/stereo/ computer stands. Assembly is simple."
1984-01-29	NEW SPOT IN DANBURY'S CENTER	D ANBURY'S recent rejuvenation has spawned several attractive new restaurants. One of them, located right in the city's center, is Benedict's. From the street you enter an attractive cafe-bar where folk singers entertain nightly. In the quieter rear is a small room where dining areas have been created through the use of a brass rail and wood room divider. Wood panels, gaslight-type chandeliers, period paintings in ornate frames, well- spaced tables and soft lighting create a comfortable ambience for leisurely dining.
1984-01-29	IT'S THE SETTING THAT SHINES	T HE interior of Devin's, a new restaurant in Garden City, has the look of an English manor house. The grand yet graceful proportions are maintained from the handsome dark wood entrance doors leading from street or parking lot to the carved trim of the same wood, the stately ceilings and the comfortable chairs and tables. There are several dining areas. The main one could be the dining room of a country house hotel in Sussex, with leaded windows, walls above the chair rail covered in burgundy and green print, brass sconces and chandeliers and, especially welcome on a chilly evening, a fire in the hearth.
1984-01-22	COUNTRY FRENCH AND PLEASING	"-than-capacity crowds, Chez No""elle in Port Washington is still seeking an appreciative audience. This small country French restaurant, tucked unobtrusively down a somewhat industrial side street, deserves one. It is honest, authentic, unpretentious and extremely good. Housed in a modest little building, the restaurant is done in white stucco with wood trim. Provincial print fabric covers the windows, copperware adorns the walls, and tables are nicely set. This is one of just a handful of restaurants on the Island that provide a fish knife and fish fork when appropriate."
1984-01-15	"DINING OUT;
COMING UP A BIT SHORT IN TRENTON"	"CONSIDERING that Trenton is the capital of one of the most densely populated states in the country, it is surprising how few good restaurants there are in that city. What is not surprising, however, is that the most popular and well-known restaurants in the area are Italian.

 La Gondola, which is in the Chambersburg section of Trenton, is generally considered to be one of the four or five better restaurants in the city.

Access to the two dining rooms of this corner establishment is through a very large bar with dining booths. The wait for a table on a Saturday evening with or without reservations - we waited 30 minutes, and we had reservations - can be quite long, so the bar becomes a necessary waiting room."
1984-01-15	THAI, SPICY AND DELICIOUS	IN the melting pot that is Elmhurst, Queens, one would expect to find Thai restaurants. Of these, Jai-Ya is an excellent example. A long, narrow storefront decorated simply and with part of the kitchen open to view, Jai-Ya's atmosphere is aided by subdued lighting and some Thai carvings and prints. The menu is extremely lengthy. Since the restaurant is billed as ''Thai-Oriental,'' it also offers some Indian-style curries, a number of Chinese dishes such as Hunan lobster and shrimp with black bean sauce, and even chicken sukiyaki soup. We concentrated on the Thai dishes, distinguished by subtle flavors of coconut, refreshingly tangy lemon grass, simultaneously hot and cool Thai mint root, fragrant Thai basil, fiery red and green chilies and, often, a subtle underpinning of sweetness.
1984-01-08	"DINING OUT;
AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE ON INNS"	"WHY does it seem that New Jersey restaurants with the name ''Inn'' attached to them are so often as short on interesting dining as they are long on atmosphere? At least, that had been our experience until we paid several recent visits to the charming Sergeantsville Inn, where the young chef is showing potential.

 The centerpiece of the village of the same name, which is between Flemington and the Delaware River, the Inn - and, indeed, Sergeantsville itself - are as tiny and picturesque as a postcard. Originally built about 1750 and added onto since, the two-story stone building has been refurbished and made into a most appealing spot by John Touhey and Frank Ayres, who took it over two years ago.

But the bonus is that, although there are occasional flaws and a tendency toward blandness, one can dine well here. The eclectic menu of about eight main courses and four or five appetizers changes periodically, and so dishes described in this review may not always be available."
1984-01-08	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Cliffhangers: A Place To Look Over Fifteen years ago Cliffhangers opened in Bronxville with gifts and American craft items and it expanded to a second shop across Pondfield Road with Portuguese pottery, Mexican glass, Indian dhurrie and rag rugs and rag pillows plus all manner of Christmas ornaments and decorations seasonally. Prices have been dropped by 40 to 50 per cent on holiday items and other selected merchandise and storewide markdowns of varying amounts will precede the shop's closing by Jan. 21, with the goal of moving as little as possible from the shelves to a new location on the same block. The reopening is set for Feb. 1.

Handblown and handpainted Austrian heart-shaped tree ornaments were $4.50 to $9 before the holidays and fabric table runners featuring a Christmas goose, bird or poinsettias cost $25; traditional Swedish straw reindeer cost $2.50; batik angels were $3; and treeskirts of white with red and green hand appliqued turtledoves were priced at $35. Small felt trees decorated with pearls and sequins were $5, children's holiday aprons were $10 and $11.50 and pewter tree decorations were $2.75 to $5.50."
1984-01-08	NEW CREDIT CARDS FOR PHONES	IN a move designed to combat mounting fraud and carelessness, the Southern New England Telephone Company last week sent new plastic credit cards to 700,000 of its customers across Connecticut. The company also instituted new procedures to speed up the time it takes for its computer to ''notice'' a departure from a customer's routine, such as an unusual number of calls to a particular number or to faraway places, or tolls that are far more than in previous months. The company has also speeded up the time it takes to notify a customer that there may be an abuse. In Connecticut alone, Calling Card fraud increased 33 percent last year, with lost revenue rising from $750,000 to $1 million, according to telephone company officials.
1984-01-08	THE ACCENT IS PARTICULARLY FRENCH	AT Peche Mignon, a small and very particular restaurant in Huntington, dishes from the classic French repertory are lightened in nouvelle cuisine style. At the same time, some emphasis is placed on the ingredients, especially when they have been obtained from local suppliers and are of high quality. The cooking, the presentation, the wine list, the service and the generally subdued but elegant atmosphere of the restaurant with its series of intimate dining rooms are quite sophisticated. Peche Mignon is quite expensive, and recently there were too many disappointing dishes for the rating to remain at two stars.
1984-01-01	HANDSOME SETTING, WITH POTENTIAL	VILLA PORTOFINO in Mineola is a small and rather elegant-looking Continental restaurant. The dining room is handsomely paneled in wood with decorative accents provided by dusty rose provincial print fabric used as chair cushions. Because the food can be quite appealing, this new place has definite potential, but at this time the quality of the service militates against gracious dining. The captain in charge of the dining room is slow to cater to the needs of his customers, and his lack of attention means that, instead of being relaxing, a meal becomes a series of irritating lapses. Where are the menus? What about the specials? Can we catch his eye so he'll take the wine order? Why did he recork the red wine after opening it? The table was cleared 10 minutes ago and it's about time he took the dessert order.
1983-12-25	ITALIAN-CONTINENTAL AND DIFFERENT	ON the printed menu at Herrmann's Black Sheep in Melville are listed many of the dishes that one generally finds in Italian- Continental restaurants. But the preparation, done with a distinctively lighter hand, sets this restaurant apart. In addition, some of the daily specials are often quite original. The restaurant does not have a particularly appealing entrance, opening onto a large, dim bar with very audible radio music (and announcements). The atmosphere in the small, multilevel main dining room to one side is more pleasant. There is another small dining room on the other side of the bar, used mostly on Saturday nights and for private parties.
1983-12-18	A MORE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE	established restaurant in Bridgehampton, became Reatherford's Plum. That was not the only change. As Ron Reatherford, who bought the restaurant three years ago, explained it, he and his partner, Gail Rose, wanted to appeal to a year-round audience, not just a vacation crowd. ''With the Sugarplum name, people would call to find out if they needed a jacket for dinner,'' Mr. Reatherford said. ''They definitely do not need jackets here.''
1983-12-18	A STELLAR PERFORMER IN STAMFORD	RESTAURANTS come and go, soar, plummet and sometimes rise again. La Bretagne, a model of consistency, never has had those problems. In its new location in a building with a white brick facade on U. S. 1 between Stamford and Old Greenwich, this French restaurant continues to be one of the stellar performers on the Fairfield County restaurant scene. For some reason, La Bretagne has not enjoyed the wide appreciation its fine kitchen deserves. Its former setting at the edge of a supermarket complex may have been partly responsible. The decor was minimal and unimpressive, the quarters crowded. Now, three dining rooms with well- spaced tables give a greater sense of spaciousness and quality. The only flaws: lighting that is too dim and a chilliness in the rooms. La Bretagne's staff seems as capable, unobtrusive and professional as any we have encountered.
1983-12-16	RESTAURANTS	LE PETIT ROBERT has almost all the ingredients of a favorite little hideaway in an out-of-the-way Parisian arrondissement: excellent dishes, as well as mediocre ones, reasonable prix-fixe dinners, along with a la carte selections, and a decor that suggests the space had a less glamorous life before it became a restaurant. Where this West Village spot parts company with a Paris bistro is in the service. Here it is often careless and sometimes startlingly rude. Le Petit Robert is situated in what used to be a corner store. Everything has been given a coat of cream-color paint - the brick, the walls and dividers of orange-crate-like boards, a few exposed pipes and the latticework put up over the windows and mirrors. The effect is pleasant and outdoorsy.
1983-12-11	NEWCOMER ON THE SEAFOOD LIST	AT the Colonnade, a stunning new seafood restaurant in Manhasset, the menu states that all the fish is fresh and never frozen. This is certainly praiseworthy, but even the freshest of fish, if not carefully prepared, will fail to please the discriminating diner. Just reading the plastic-coated menu at the Colonnade provides an indication that despite what may be a careful selection of the ingredients, the cooking promises to be typical of most of the informal seafood houses on the Island, and that is not a good sign. What is surf and turf doing on a fine seafood menu? (The fish may be fresh, but there is plenty of frozen shellfish served here.)
1983-12-11	A GOOD SELECTION OF VEAL DISHES	WITH Christmas just two weeks away, Santa has given us an early present: the discovery of a new, good Northern Italian restaurant. And as an extra bonus, Il Villano is in Fairfield County, a part of the state where Northern Italian restaurants have been in short supply. Il Villano is located in the center of Westport in a frame building that has housed several other restaurants in the recent past. The interior space has been divided into several attractive dining areas. The smallest is tucked cozily next to the bar. The major room, with wood-paneled walls, low ceiling, and a fire burning in the hearth, is not much larger. A third porch-like space, with natural oak- backed chairs, white walls and wood-latticed windows that screen out a parking lot across the street, is especially light and airy at lunchtime.
1983-12-09	RESTAURANT	All American and distinctive. WHILE the debate over the definition of new American cooking drones on, Lawrence P. Forgione is practicing one distinctive interpretation at his six-week-old restaurant, An American Place. Though his cooking is grounded in the techniques of the French kitchen, Mr. Forgione has made his mark using only American ingredients and redefining traditional American recipes. It is already difficult to book a table, in part because so many food professionals have been flocking to this small restaurant, curious to see what Mr. Forgione, formerly chef at the River Cafe, is doing.
1983-12-04	"DINIG OUT;
A FESTIVAL OF COLOR IN MONTROSE"	"JUDGING from the weekend crowd waiting for tables, India House, open for little more than a month, has already been discovered. Owned and attended personally by Simpson Kalaphara and his family, also of the long-established Bengal Tiger in White Plains, India House is still getting into stride. However, its corner of the county has so few places offering good and interesting food that diners might be interested to know about India House even in its nonage.

 One can't miss this bright spot on Route 9A. Large picture windows glow with color from the dining room, a pair of full-cheeked lions and a graceful stone dancer mark the entrance door opened by a turbaned, crimson-clad attendant."
1983-12-04	A MENU TO MATCH ELEGANT DECOR	FINALLY, the food at La Vigna in Greenvale has become a match for the setting. The handsomely elegant decor was installed several years ago, and lately it has been evident that the kitchen has taken a turn for the better. The menu remains mostly Italian, with fewer Continental or French dishes than one finds in other elaborate restaurants clustered in the Glen Cove area. There is some definite sophistication in the quail and lamb dishes, as well as some pastas that are not the stock in trade of every other northern Italian restaurant on the Island. The wine list offers a broad range of Italian selections from Sicily to Piedmont, and the service is gracious.
1983-12-04	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	Treasures to Stimulate The Spirit of Giving Seven years ago The Teachers' Room opened in White Plains, primarily to serve those involved daily in nursery through elementary education, but the word spread also to parents, grandparents and friends that there was a new source for quality, noncommercial children's books and paperbacks, games, puzzles, tapes, records, clay, microscopes, puppets and toys, along with advice on age groups, creative quality and suitability. The records in stock are mostly not about television characters, but rather about Curious George, Babar, Rip Van Winkle or ''Treasure Island,'' or they may be songs by Hap Palmer, Ella Jenkins, Tom Glazer and Pete Seeger. A book entitled ''Your Children Need Music'' is $8.95 and can be used at home or in school. The Little Thinker series at $7.95 each provide one-hour of activities using tapes, sketchbook and crayons and has varied themes to challenge children 4 to 8 years old - ''The Sea,'' ''The Circus,'' ''Fun Poems,'' ''Safety,'' ''Dinosaurs'' and ''Supersites in America.'' The durable Fisher-Price cassette player lists at $79 but sells here at $59, including one activity tape; even 2-year-olds can manage the mechanism.
1983-12-03	Your MoneyLeonard Sloane Pros and Cons Of Bank Cards	BANK cards, under the names Visa and Mastercard, have in the past 15 years become ubiquitous. Some 110 million of these cards have been issued, and there were used in 1.5 billion transactions and purchases of $65 billion last year. Most cards are credit cards, through which cardholders are extended credit until their bill is paid. But an increasing number of consumers are being issued debit cards, even if they are not fully aware of it. These cards work like a check and involve immediate withdrawals from their accounts.
1983-11-30	FOOD NOTES	Chopped Liver, by Hand Unlike most of us, Maria Solomon can do without the food processor. Her hand-chopped liver is prepared the old-fashioned way, in a wooden bowl with a curved blade chopper, a hocknesser. The delicious chopped liver, sold as Maria's East Coast Chopped Chicken Liver, is assertively, honestly seasoned, savory with garlic, chunky in texture and almost golden from the eggs and chicken fat. It never turns gray, and if it brings tears to your eyes it is not because of the onions: They are tears of joys. Miss Solomon uses her own recipe, although she said she had consulted with her grandmother and her Aunt Sarah.
1983-11-29	A.T.& T. TO OFFER CREDIT CARD SYSTEM	The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said today that it would offer credit cards for use in charging calls at new, coinless telephones. The new phones will start going into service in January at airports, hotel lobbies, convention centers and other public places. The service will not produce any savings in phone rates, said Frank Blount, marketing vice president for A.T.& T. Communications, but travelers will find it faster and easier to place a call.
1983-11-29	CITICORP IN THE SUPERMARKET	Citicorp is joining forces with leading supermarkets in Florida and California to give its credit card holders easy access to cash. The nation's largest bank holding company also expects similar accords soon in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area. The move is seen as a further dilution of Federal laws that prohibit interstate banking. Citicorp has already signed agreements with Safeway Stores Inc. in California and Publix Super Markets Inc. in Florida. Its potential partner in the New York area has not been identified.
1983-11-27	IN THE MEXICAN MANNER	LA FONDA DEL SOL in Hicksville serves the typical tortilla-based specialties that have become the most popular representatives of the Mexican kitchen in the United States. But here they do not have the mass- produced quality often evident in Mexican restaurants, especially the chains. There are a number of more elaborate dishes as well. The seviche, made of diced red snapper marinated in lime juice with tomatoes, onions and pepper, is brightly fresh-tasting, an excellent appetizer that needs only an additional touch of the hot red ''salsa'' if spicier seasonings appeal to you. The mashed and seasoned avocado, guacamole, is decent without adding some hot sauce at the table and better with it.
1983-11-20	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"In the Business of Discounting It All

 Discounts substantially off nationally advertised prices are available at The Outlet Center, which opened on Election Day in Mahopac, in Putnam County, with seven major national outlets recruited by the Aries Brandenberg Management Company.  Nelly the elephant lifted the ceremonial red ribbon while local elected officials snipped it.

The Cavaliers of Mahopac High School provided a musical background and two clowns distributed balloons and charmed children of all ages before the brisk and serrious business of bargain shopping took over for the day.  By next year, nine additional shops will open at the cete just across the county line from Baldwin Place in Somers.

The hours are 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. Monday through Friday, until 6 P.M. Saturday and noon to 5 P.M. Sunday.  Most shops take credit cards and checks with two identifications, and some have gift certificates and mailing lists.  Most outlets give credit on returns within 10 days when all receipts and labels are included and a few have arranged post-Christmas returns within 10 days.  The Outlet Center is at Route 6 and Miller Road, less than three miles east of the Taconic Parkway's northbound exit to Route 6, which is right after the Shrub Oak exit."
1983-11-20	PUTTING ALL YOUR ASSETS IN ONE BASKET	''GOD is in the details,'' Friedrich Nietzsche once said. In financial services, innovations are often found in the details. Take the case of the growing number of central asset management accounts now being introduced by an array of financial institutions. These accounts, largely patterned after Merrill Lynch's highly successful Cash Management Account, tie together a checking account, a moneymarket fund, a credit card, a line of credit and a securities brokerage account. You can readily buy each of these services separately, but Michael Sanderson, manager of the Cash Management Group at Merrill Lynch, notes, ''These accounts provide convenience, yield and access features which people want.''
1983-11-20	A PROMISING START, AND THEN...	IMAGINE a restaurant where the captain asks if you would like a cocktail or the wine list, where half portions of pasta can be ordered and he offers to serve a little of each to everyone at the table, and where those pastas are first rate, and you have our initial impression of Gian- Lorenzo in Bayville. Unfortunately, the appeal vanished with the serving of the main cours. On a first visit we had started with ziti tossed in a well-garlicked broccoli sauce, superb potato gnocchi in a rich veal sauce and a dish called sagne a pezze montenero, consisting of squares of homemade pasta in a fragrant tomato and basil sauce - pastas that were not only inventive but also excellently prepared. It became difficult to understand how the same kitchen could produce the rest of the food we were served on more than one occasion.
1983-11-17	Jersey Expanding Credit-Card Bail	A program permitting defendants in Municipal Courts to pay fines and post bail with credit cards may be made available next year throughout New Jersey, officials said today. New Jersey is the first state where the program will be made available to all Municipal Courts, according to a spokesman for the Western Union Corporation, Don Dutcher.
1983-11-13	"DINING OUT;
CLIFTON: NO LACK OF CHINESE CHEFS"	"IN A comfortable, modern setting on Clifton's

 busy Route 46, 10 chefs from Chengdu, the

capital of China's Szechwan Province, serve

dishes that are a far cry from those of the typical neighborhood chop suey parlor.

Under the same ownership as the Sichuan Pavilion in Manhattan, Chengdu 46 opened just two and a half months ago in the former location of the House of Lam. The smart black and white decor centers around a brush painting of the province's famous panda bears.

Black banquettes, black and white China and fresh carnations (the only touch of red) on the white-clothed tables, as well as courteous, Continental-style service, come as something of a surprise to those accustomed to the plastic tabletops and offhand service at many suburban Chinese restaurants."
1983-11-13	A CHIEF ADEPT AT CREAM SAUCES	LITCHFIELD is one of the loveliest towns in Connecticut, but in recent years it has lacked a restaurant of substance and overnight facilities to accommodate visitors. With the opening of the Toll Gate Hill Inn last July, all that has changed. The barn-red clapboard house, dating back to 1745, has both agreeable dining capabilities and six guest rooms upstairs. There are two dining rooms on the ground floor, each with a welcoming wood-burning fireplace (whose use is restricted to weekends), and a larger room upstairs for private parties. Both ground- floor rooms are small and cozy. One is paneled in dark wood; the other has a wood-paneled fireplace wall, but its other white walls, with Pompeian-red painted wood trim, feature prints of Early American primitives. Wide wooden floor boards and low, exposed beam ceilings are reminders of the building's age.
1983-11-13	A MEAL AMID MILITARY MEMORIES	AS theme park restaurants go, the one called 56th Fighter Group at Republic Airport in Farmingdale is worth experiencing, especially if your recollection of World War II is more vivid than the pages of a history book. For example, would you recognize the voice piped in to the ladies' room as Winston Churchill's? (Kate Smith belts ''God Bless America'' in the men's.) The place has been constructed to look like the bomb-scarred English farmhouse headquarters of the fighter group. (The P-47 fighter planes that became the mainstay of the unit were developed at Republic Field.) The parts of the building that suffered ''direct hits'' are evident only from the outside and do not interfere with the comfortable, almost cozy interior divided into several rooms.
1983-11-06	"DINING OUT;
THE POPULARITY OF PEKING DUCK"	"BECAUSE Peking duck is a lengthy and complicated dish to prepare, most restaurants used to require that it be ordered 24 to 48 hours in advance. However, because of its popularity, many restaurants now serve it without prior notice. The one-year-old Peking Duck House in the Bergen County community of Closter is the latest to offer this convenience.

 Here, the duck is actually carved at the table with a Chinese cleaver. A Chinese bamboo steamer containing the Mandarin pancakes is also brought to the table, along with dishes containing scallion brushes, slivers of icy cucumber and hoisin sauce."
1983-11-06	"DINING OUT;
BARGAINS AMID THE GREENERY"	"WHITE walls, bare polished floors and masses of plants, hanging, sitting, spilling, creeping, weeping and blooming seem the backdrop for many new restaurants. The greenhouse-atrium look couldn't be hotter. But Sweetwater's has an edge on the competition in the odd-shaped dining areas - a small center room wrapped with a veranda - that allow for some semiprivate alcoves and glassed views.

 Small tables are closely spaced, the noise level can be shrill at times and the food - echoing the New American style - runs occasionally amok, But considering the general high quality of ingredients and preparation, right now, Sweetwater's is one of the county's great bargains."
1983-11-06	A FISH PLACE THAT BROILS TO TASTE	AS seafood restaurants go, the pleasures outweigh the disappointments at Lure of the Sea in Cedarhurst. Definite efforts are made to serve mostly fresh fish, sometimes obtained from local waters. Overcooking is not a serious flaw. In fact, if you order your fish ''not too well done,'' the waitress may nod understandingly in approval, rather than expressing puzzled incomprehension. The menu lists over a dozen different varieties of fin fish, plus assorted shellfish. A number of these items are likely to be listed as blackboard specials as well, providing a sound indication of the kinds of fish worth ordering on a given evening. There may be some additional seafood, such as fresh Florida stone crabs, fresh Dover sole or bluefish inscribed on the blackboard from time to time.
1983-10-30	DINING OUT ; COUSCOUS, FOR SOMETHING UNUSUAL	LA BARAKA in Little Neck, Queens, is a small restaurant owned and run by a family that came to the United States from Tunesia in 1962. The family members take great pride in serving couscous, a uniquely North African specialty that is not available at any other restaurant on the Island. Couscous is the name of the grain, as well as the complete dish. The grain is made of a finely-textured semolina coated with flour and steamed, which becomes the basis for an array of other ingredients, including vegetables, various meats and condiments. At La Baraka, the couscous, offered as a complete dinner, is rather well presented.
1983-10-30	A COZY SEAFOOD SPOT	WHY is it, we wonder, that so many restaurants seem to believe that fresh seafood, especially shellfish, requires heavy breading and deep frying? Do they have something to hide or is it merely a custom held over from times when that might have been the case? These questions came to mind once again as we dined at Capt'n John's Fish Market, an East Norwalk restaurant spawned by a fish market of the same name on the Norwalk-Wilton line. Capt'n John's, at first glance, offers considerable promise as a dining experience. The small storefront restaurant has been separated - through judicious use of pine latticing - into several cozy dining areas. Knotty pine wainscoting complements a nautical-chart wallpaper, providing a hint of the sea without overdoing it. Friendly, well-trained waitresses add to the generally pleasing, informal ambience.
1983-10-23	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"The Staff of Life In Many Forms Alter's Bakery in North Tarrytown is a step back into the old world. There are no preservatives, but plenty of natural ingredients and handshaped bread, rolls and coffeecakes slipped deep into the 18-foot-by- 12-foot ovens by Alfred Rahming, a baker with 27 years of experience in the shop.

Each Wednesday, when the mixing, proofing, shaping and filling begins, earlybird customers know to pick up the first warm batches of the week. The charge drops to half on leftover loaves, but that is not an everyday occurrence; quoted prices are usually steady, with occasional changes related to the cost of ingredients.

The third generation of the Alter family has taken its place now as the 54th year begins for the water-and- rye-flour sourdough, the key to the yeastless, heavy cornbread, a heavy rye East-European bread (now 90 cents a pound) sought out by successive generations of customers uninterested in commercially produced and wrapped bread varieties."
1983-10-23	TASTY AND HOT IN NORWALK	OUR region's culinary love affair with the spicier cuisines of China - Sichuan and Hunan - shows no signs of cooling off. Nor is it unrequited love. New restaurants featuring these peppery specialties continue to open throughout Fairfield County and elsewhere in Connecticut, eager to woo diners who have become addicted to the taste of red-hot chili peppers. The Fortune Cookie is one recent arrival. Located in a Post Road shopping center in Norwalk, the restaurant is located in a building that formerly sheltered a fast-food eatery, a fact we were reminded of by the decor. The same dining space configuration, with booths along each side and a wide, long aisle between, is a reminder of the previous occupant. Chinese paintings and red wall plaques attempt to impose a new identity on the premises, but it would help even more to have the dark brown walls repainted. Competent, cheerful service helps somewhat to mitigate the gloomy atmosphere.
1983-10-23	A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER	RISTORANTE SAN GIORGIO in Westbury changed ownership several months ago with notably good results. It was always an attractive place, with an understated formality that was not overbearing, but, despite the appeal of the setting, the food sampled on numerous occasions was inconsistent. When the restaurant was last reviewed about a year ago, the service had become quite careless. Now the welcome is warm without being too familiar, and the service is friendly but correct. The food has definitely improved, with a number of worthwhile appetizer and main dish creations as well as a selection of excellent pastas. The flaws tend to be typical of many northern Italian-Continental restaurants. Undistinguished, overly thickened sauces are sometimes applied too liberally; canned vegetable garnishes that may have been considered fancy at one time are still used, and salads are poorly made.
1983-10-21	RESTAURANTS	From the Far East to the Southwest. I S there cosmic significance to a menu that offers both potato salad and sashimi? Can one read deeper meaning into a restaurant that employs Japanese chefs and American waiters? Probably. East has finally met West at Gyosai and, in hindsight, the meeting seems inevitable. When sushi bars in America started serving California rolls - seaweed and rice wrapped around avocado, crab, crab roe and cucumber - it was only a matter of time before someone would decide that both Japanese and American food, or at least a Japanese chef's version of American food, should be served in the same restaurant. Katsutoshi Fukumitsu, the owner of a chain of sushi bars in Japan, and three Takesushi (also spelled with a ''z'') restaurants in this country,is responsible for this phenomenon.
1983-10-16	IN SEARCH OF SEAFOOD	LOOK for a seafood restaurant on the Island, and you may find that the Galley in Lindenhurst is typical. It is an unfortunate fact of dining out on the Island that the preparation of seafood (as in the case of duck, the other highly esteemed local product) is often mediocre. With few exceptions, seafood menus offer a selection of dishes that would be more acceptable in Des Moines or Albuquerque than in an area bordered by sea and Sound. At the Galley, for example, roughly half the dishes listed on the menu involve shrimp, Alaskan king crab or lobster tails, all of which are delivered frozen. The only seasonal item listed is soft-shell crabs.
1983-10-16	FARE OF THE SEA IN NORWALK	OUR latest odyssey for seafood took us to downtown Norwalk to The Lighthouse. Inside, a dimly lighted hallway leads past a darkened bar on the right to a less dark dining room on two levels. Wood siding and brick walls with ''portholes'' of a colored-glass design, tanks of tropical fish and lobsters and overhead lanterns are the main concessions to nautical decor. Tiffany-type lampshades add an eclectic touch, and small vases of fresh flowers on each table complete the scene. Service combined friendliness with professionalism. The menu at The Lighthouse emphasizes seafood prepared in a variety of styles - Italian, French, American and Scandinavian. If you opt for the simpler basic dishes, you will fare better. A swordfish fillet, simply broiled, was generous in portion and satisfying, as was a huge platter of broiled scallops, oysters, clams and shrimp. On the other hand, even the mildly complex choices generally lacked expertise, resulting in a rather rudimentary version of the stated dish.
1983-10-09	"CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Books Are Part Of the Story"	"The Remarkable Book Shop interior in Westport, Conn., is as warmly remarkable as its hot strawberry exterior paint - busy with a red dot sale at 40 percent off in the gift shop early last month and a window promotion heralding ''My Son the Author'' about a local writer, Mark Kramer, and his book, ''Invasive Procedures,'' following the autograph party. The weekly special of a current hardcover best-seller is always 25 percent off.

Gardening and cooking books at 40 to 80 percent off and children's books at 35 to 85 percent off or more, are displayed on the patio in large pink bins that remain open for browsing except during rainy spells. The canvas two- handled tote bag with Remarkable's dancing-man logo costs $8.95. A fake bear-skin rug? A mere $35 here, without guilt."
1983-10-09	A PLACE WITH TWO PERSONALITIES	LA GALLERIA in Westbury is a restaurant with a split personality. Its mood swing makes it more appealing on weekdays. On weekend evenings, not only the service but also the food and the very atmosphere suffer from the crush of a capacity crowd. This is a small but attractive place with rough white stucco walls punctuated with Art Nouveau posters, a beamed ceiling and navy blue accents. The lighting is bright but not garish. The tables are fairly close together, but when some of them are not occupied there is a comfortable, relaxed feeling. On weekends, not only does the crowding detract from this atmosphere, but the noise reaches an unpleasant level.
1983-10-07	RESTAURANTS	Nouveau cafeteria, American-style. THE stretch limos are lined up outside. At peak hours, the noise level in the dining room precludes serious conversation. The bar is zinc, the floor terrazzo. Much of the staff is undisciplined. Such a description fits any number of the city's restaurants where the patrons go for the scene rather than the food. What distinguishes the six-week-old Cafe Luxembourg from similar establishments is its cooking.
1983-10-02	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Faraway Places Close to Home Indoor jaunts to faraway places without passports, shots and language or money problems can be enjoyed at Dibblelogs: Travelogs with a Difference in both White Plains and Bronxville this fall. Buying all four tickets the first night of a series saves 25 percent.

This Friday marks the first meeting the 17th season of Dibblelogs under the auspices of White Plains Adult Education. The seats of the Ridgeway School auditorium fill quickly with regulars, sometimes by 8 P.M., for the 8:15 illustrated lectures with commentary by Eloise Dibble and color photography by her husband, Earl, as they continue their 47-year pattern of sharing worldwide travels."
1983-09-30	RESTAURANTS	INEVITABLY, a reviewer comes across a restaurant that falls between two ratings, better than one star, for example, but not quite up to two. In such instances, this reviewer has chosen the more conservative rating, feeling it was better to promote than to demote in the future. This was the case when one-star ratings were first given to the Odeon at 145 West Broadway in TriBeCa, in December 1981, and to the Bombay Palace at 30 West 52d Street, in October 1979. Now both deserve two stars and for the same reason: their kitchens seem surer of themselves, and seasonings are less tentative than they were. Since it opened in 1980, the Odeon, an Art Deco cafeteria-turned-restaurant, has become a quintessential New York meeting place. The equanimity with which the staff and customers view all kinds of dress typifies the New Yorker's imperviousness to eccentricities. The improvement at the Odeon is especially noteworthy now that the chef and management are busy with their new restaurant, Cafe Luxembourg, on 70th Street, between Amsterdam and West End Avenues.
1983-09-25	A LOW-PRICED FIND IN BETHEL	CHARISMA may be as important in the restaurant business as in politics. How else do you explain why restaurant A thrives and restaurant B, similar in menu, preparation, service and ambience, does not? This was the question we asked ourselves when dining on a Friday night in Hinckley's Opera House Cafe in Bethel. The location could not be better - on the ground floor of a historic opera house, a huge frame building in the center of town. Yet the restaurant was just about empty.
1983-09-23	RESTAURANTS	Upgraded choice; decorative Thai. AS evidence of what fine tuning can do in a kitchen, consider Vanessa, a Bleecker Street restaurant that received a one-star rating when it opened in 1981. Vanessa is now well worth two stars and, it must be assumed, this is the result of the new kitchen staff trained by the chef, Anne Rosenzweig, who took over a year ago. The menu in this romantic Art Deco setting reflects the new American style of cooking, and savory new dishes have been added to the originals. What has also persisted is the noise and crowding in some corners. Most of the food compensates for the minor discomforts, and even for the service, which is sometimes slow. Appetizers are generally excellent, most especially the flan Vanessa, a hot mousse of shrimp and scallop in lobster sauce; smoked chicken breast with fresh fruit, and a seafood salad with a mango vinaigrette dressing. Almost as good are the warm salads of wild mushrooms on greens and shrimp with slivered leeks. The only disappointments were roulades of Norwegian salmon because of dry and fishy salmon caviar and blini with golden sturgeon caviar, which were ridiculous - crepes the size of a quarter with almost invisible dabs of cr eme fra^iche and, again, fishy caviar. Gazpacho was overacidic, but a lobster bisque was delicate yet luxurious.
1983-09-18	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Bargain Hunters On the Road Again Bargain hunters willing to leave the Y.W.C.A. in White Plains at 7:30 A.M. September 28 for a bus and train trip to New Jersey's discount outlets in Flemington are scheduled to return by 6 P.M. Y.W.C.A. members can register for $40, nonmembers for $50.

The fee includes brunch at a restored train station on the Delaware River in Lambertville and a 45- minute ride through the Hunterdon countryside on the Black River & Western Railroad. Two to three hours have been scheduled for the shopping and the browsing in a Colonial setting, and then wine and cheese are to be served before the bus trip home.

Sandra Bowen Jenkins is taking reservations at 949-6227 and prepayments can be mailed to 515 North Street, White Plains, 10605. All-day parking at the Y.W.C.A. is free."
1983-09-17	BANKING'S CREDIT CARD LURES	"With the bank credit card market saturated after 15 years, participants in the battle for customers have come to rely on one main weapon: marketing ingenuity.

Citibank gives holders of its Mastercard and Visa card ''Citidollar$'' toward catalogue merchandise discounts with every purchase made.

Manufacturers Hanover Trust recently ran a sweepstakes program, with card members ''entering'' each time they used the card.

And at Manufacturers and Traders Trust in Buffalo, members of eight upstate American Automobile Association clubs get reduced annual fees for Visa cards issued through the bank."
1983-09-16	Esoteric Japanese and new American.	ONE of the best kept secrets of the Japanese community in New York is Chikubu, a small, neat restaurant on 62d Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues. Japanese customers outnumber others by 20 to 1, which means that the esoteric food served at Chikubu will have the strongest appeal to the most serious converts to Japanese cooking. Certainly, the cramped quarters of its casual interior are not exactly conducive to gracious dining. And because most staff members speak only the most rudimentary English, the service is awkward and frustrating. The real high spot is the counter, which has only about a dozen seats that the customers generally occupy for an entire evening. At that counter, the owner-chef, Hironobu Kishimoto, holds forth and, if asked, will plan the menu for each guest. He skillfully slices raw fish with a precision knife that costs $1,500 and arranges both fish and vegetables into artful ''foodscapes'' that seem almost limitless in their variety and extraordinary subtlety. During each of two dinners at the counter, we were served completely different dishes.
1983-09-11	LUXURIOUS AND ALTOGETHER FRENCH	LA COTE D'OR in the new Garden City Hotel is unlike any other luxury restaurant on the Island. It has been patterned after the finest hotel dining rooms in cosmopolitan cities around the world, a category of restaurants that has undergone a renaissance in recent years. The chef, Patrick Pinon, was formerly at La R^ecolte in the Intercontinental Hotel in Manhattan. Like the other public areas of the Garden City Hotel, La C^ote d'Or is elegant and suggests that no expense has been spared. Although tables have been well spaced, the acoustics cause conversations to reverberate around the room, making discussions across the table inaudible.
1983-09-11	WHERE SALADS ARE SPECIAL	WHEN J. G. Cristada in Westport first opened, it was esthetically satisfying to look at, imaginative in its offerings, disorganized in its service and pricey. More than a year later, it is still all of the above. There have been changes in the interim. The spaciousness of the long, high-ceilinged storefront location, so handsome to look at, has obviously had to be put to more productive use to be economically viable. Now an ice-cream bar has been erected in the front right corner. Cafe tables on the left-hand side seem to have multiplied.
1983-09-11	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	The Long and Short Of Dresses for 57 Years Martha West has been a family- owned shop in White Plains for 57 years, specializing in knitwear and special-occasion long and short dresses. The main sale periods are July and December, but sale items are available beyond those periods. Sizes are 6 to 42 and 10 1/2 to 26 1/2, with custom orders possible for the hard- to-fit at no extra charge. The best-known knitwear names are Keith Adams, Kensington and Castleberry. One two-piece jacquard knit imported from England and formerly $200 now sells for $100; a tailored turquoise-and-white Kensington, earlier $190, is $145 and an all- wool three-piece blue set by Castleberry, formerly $280, is down to $190.
1983-09-09	RESTAURANT	Exotic cuisines at modest prices. ALTHOUGH New York restaurants are unquestionably the most expensive in the country, it is also true that the city offers the widest and most diverting assortment of inexpensive eating places. Two cases in point are the restaurants reviewed today, one Vietnamese, the other Hungarian; together they prove that it is possible to eat for about $10 to $12 a person, or even less, and still do so with style. Walk down the steep stairway to the Viet-Nam Restaurant on Doyers Street in Chinatown, and you will find yourself in a small, informal, though neat and orderly dining room. Calendar-style paintings of Saigon scenes are decorative and poignant touches. The young waiters are engagingly polite and helpful, explaining dishes and how they should be eaten. Order the grilled ground shrimp packed around sticks of sugar cane, and the waiter explains about rolling them in thin rice- flour crepes and garnishing them with lime juice or hot sauce. Whether as appetizers or main courses, salads of shrimp or shrimp and pork are based on shredded cabbage and fragrant fish sauce, and the waiter suggests that hot chili sauce be added and the dish stirred before it is eaten. Satays, small pieces of meat grilled on bamboo skewers, are suitable as appetizers or main courses; among the best are grilled pork on a stick and tiny nuggets of lemon-scented chicken.

FRESHNESS OF SUSHI IN HARTSDALE"	"TO the gustatory delight of many diners, the county's first independent sushi house has opened a few doors up from the railroad station in Hartsdale. Although sushi bars have in the last few years wandered northward from Manhattan, until now this genre has been incorporated into restaurants serving primarily cooked Japanese dishes. Not that raw fish enthusiasts have been ungrateful. But sushi prepared in the best of full-course Japanese restaurants cannot compare with that served in shops that serve nothing else.

 Sushi and all its manifestations requires constant attention, from buying and keeping perfect fish to mixing perfect rice. Azuma Sushi proved accomplished on all counts. To make vinegared rice, the constant of all sushi, hot cooked rice is simultaneously tossed with a wooden paddle in a sweeping lateral motion, sprinkled with a salt- sugar-vinegar dressing and cooled with a fan as quickly as possible to room temperature. This frantic process separates the grains and keeps them from becoming bruised or mashed. The fish, in particular, was conspicuously, irreproachably, superlatively fresh. Savor its full flavor by letting the fish, not the rice, touch the tongue first."
1983-09-04	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Up to 50% Off On Summerwear The Chatterbox in Harrison has changed ownership after 28 years in the children's clothing business - in time for back-to-school purchases, preholiday buying and 1984 camp purchases not dependent on size. The store's slogan has been ''from pram to prom'' but the sizes, actually, are infant to 20 for boys and to 14 for girls. 

Prices are now up to 50 percent off on summerwear and 40 percent off on Mighty-Mac winter wear for boys. Unlined camp jackets in many colors are $22 and lined jackets are $35; and the sizeless basic camp cot sheets, towels, duffels, ponchos and blankets are all marked down."
1983-09-04	A GOOD SERVING OF AMENITIES	IN assessing a restaurant like La Pace in Glen Cove, it is important to read between the stars. They do not tell the whole story. To cast a critical eye on the food alone would result in little better than a one-star rating. But the spacious elegance of the restaurant, the graciousness with which the service is accomplished, the attractiveness of the presentation and the relatively moderate prices all enhance the dining experience. You might easily argue that in the final analysis what counts is the food and, thus persuaded, you should consider La Pace a one-star restaurant. If other amenities are important, however, La Pace is clearly better than that.
1983-08-28	"The Careful Shopper;
All the Ingredients Of a Health Co-op"	"Twelve years ago the nonprofit Way of Life Co-op opened in Pleasant-ville to provide natural and organically grown food to members anxious to avoid chemical fertilizers, pesticides, sprays, additives and preservatives.  

There are 400 families participating now for a $10 yearly fee, and there is a one-month trial membership for $1.  In addition to the fee, there must be a work commitment of three hours each month (working in the store, on special projects, or serving on the board) or a surcharge of 15 percent is added.  All sales are cash-and-carry."
1983-08-28	"Dining out; 
Rusticity and Home-Style Cooking"	"DON'T expect liveried serving hierarchy; all dining-room staff remind one more of Mom.  Nor expect luxuriously spaced tables, to which diners in the county have become accustomed; the two cramped rooms are tight with tables and antiques - samplers, baskets, prints, bread tins, dishes, pots, wood planes, quilts -- for decoration and for sale.  Proverbial crisp linen gives way to functional ceramic tile-topped tables, and napkins are red bandanas from which diners unroll their place settings.  But excepting a few leaves of sandy spinach, nothing bad left the kitchen, and much was superb.  

The owners and cooks, Patricia Levin and Howard Fuchs, opened The Cookshop last January, creating from the seediness of an old coffee shop a fitting backdrop of homey rusticity for home-style cooking.  What the two can't produce themselves they buy judiciously.  For instance, the Rockland Bakery supplied a delicious whole-grained black bread, our favorite, and North Tarrytown's Alters delivered the lighter whole wheat loaves.  Both came to the table in calico-lined baskets."
1983-08-28	Ambitious Menu in a Cafe Setting	GREENSTREET in Northport changed hands late last year. It was always a pleasantly informal country cafe done in green and white with an airy, light look. The new owners have not revised the decor, but they have created a rather ambitious menu that is French with Continental overtones. Despite a few commendable accomplishments, a number of flaws marred the cooking on recent visits, so that the restaurant cannot be recommended as highly now as it had been in the past. Some of the appetizers are quite original. For example, snails are served in crisp little brown pastry puffs and are assertively seasoned with garlic, shallots, chives and butter for a series of sumptuously fragrant mouthfuls. Greenstreet also has the courage to include calves' brains on a list of only five appetizers. Never an item to win popularity contests, and one that many people might even hesitate to taste, they are prepared very nicely here. The rich but delicate pale meat, which resembles sweetbreads but with a softer consistency, is served in a shallow casserole with a classic, properly piquant sauce of capers, lemon, vinegar and browned butter.
1983-08-28	A Terrific Waterfront View	THE Bascule Bridge opens and a graceful sailboat glides past. Then another, and still another. The periodic nautical parade along the Mystic River is unquestionably the most exciting aspect of dining at the year-old Mystic River Tavern. It even compensates for the long wait between courses and disorganized service that seems characteristic of this otherwise attractive establishment.
1983-08-21	"DINING OUT;
JAPANESE CUISINE IN FORT LEE"	"WHAT could be more refreshing during the dog days of summer than a cool mosaic of Japanese sushi or shashimi arrayed on a lacquer tray?

 Sitting at the trim blond-wood sushi bar in Fort Lee's newest Nipponese restaurant, patrons watch the chef Yamaguchi as he deftly slices and places with lapidary precision the morsels of coral tuna and pearly white fish either atop cylinders of vinegared rice for sushi or by themselves for sashimi.

The seven-week-old restaurant (which adjoins but is not affiliated with a motel on Route 4) has the unprepossessing look of a truck stop. Despite outward appearances, Yamaguchi has already been discovered by the local Japanese community and many of the tables are occupied by Oriental businessmen who take their dining seriously."
1983-08-21	ARMONK CHILI WIZARD ONCE AGAIN TO SEEK INTERNATIONAL TITLE	"FOR the second year in a row, Robert Kitchener's tangy mixture of beef, tomato sauce, capsicum peppers, onions, garlic, red wine and other choice ingredients lived up to its name of ''The Right Stuff,'' capturing first place in the Chili Appreciation Society International's New York State cookoff held Aug. 13 at Playland in Rye. And, according to the chief judge, John A. Hryncewich Jr., of Hawthorne, N.J., it was ''the winner by a nice margin,'' besting 14 other entries.

That means that Mr. Kitchener, the vice president of information systems for MasterCard and an Armonk resident, will once again be taking a November jaunt to desolate Terlingua, Tex., where he hopes to prevail in the hottest of all chili cookoffs and bring the coveted international title back to Westchester. He tried last year but failed."
1983-08-21	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Accent on Variety And on Price Cuts

Gifts a la mode, which opened in Harrison six years ago, is a source for lingerie and accessories discounted by 30 percent, jewelry 20 percent down from manufacturer's recommended prices, soft luggage at 10 to 20 percent off and designer purses and lizard and snake handbags at one-third off department store prices. Belts, barware, Seiko watches and clocks, baby and children's gifts, desk accessories and the Paint-Wear sweatsuits, tops, jackets and shorts reflect the variety in the shop.

The painted casual clothes can be purchased as a set or individually as top or shorts for $16, pants at $24, sweatshirt at $30 and zip jacket at $40 - various colors of tennis balls and footprints are scattered on the solid background.

Mirrored letters as names are $20 to $28 and the shapes can also be a tennis racquet, golf bag, musical notes, a painter's palette, a unicorn or numerals 40 or 50 for a birthday or other anniversary, at varying prices. The names can be painted on the mirrored shapes for $3."
1983-08-14	"DINING OUT;
SEASIDE FARE IN BRIELLE"	"SHORE restaurants are usually either small and intimate, with the food cooked to order, or large food palaces where the food - whether prepared on premises or arriving in frozen food packs, is churned out more to appease appetites than to please palates.

 Churchill's in Brielle is neither.

The large restaurant, formerly the Horn 'n Musket, is divided into four dining rooms. All are casual and each is decorated to create a different atmosphere. Although the food is a cut above some of the other large restaurants in the area, both it and the service quality seem to depend on which room one is seated in."
1983-08-14	A GOOD SPOT FOR THEATERGOERS	FORTUNATELY , right next door to the Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield is the Playhouse Cafe, a convenient place to snack or dine before or after a theater performance. While the theatrical season ends Sept. 4, our last report was that the cafe may remain open until Oct. 1. It would be best to check by phone, however, before making a special trip. Decor at the Playhouse Cafe has something of a theatrical look itself: barrel vaulting made of thin strips of natural wood creates the illusion of greater space than actually exists in the orange- painted interior. The brick fireplace along one wall seems somewhat unnecessary if the cafe closes at the end of summer. Hanging plants and lights a bit too bright for a restaurant complete the cheerful and fairly pared-down look.
1983-08-12	REATAURANTS	ALTHOUGH it is not necessary to say that Joe, or even Jose, sent you, you do have to ring a bell and be buzzed into Jose Sent Me, a new and engaging Tex-Mex restaurant on the second floor of a building on 55th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. The slightly seedy staircase hardly prepares you for the inviting and casual but smartly decorated dining rooms. The front room is done as an airy rustic cafe, and the inner room, with booths and with carpet on the wall, has a more formal look. In hot weather, the front room is preferable because the air-conditioning is more effective. The background music is more forgivable than in most places because country music seems to be an essential seasoning for the Southwestern food. Tex-Mex spicy and country cool. In either room, you may have the same light and freshly prepared Tex-Mex food that is a little short on authoritative seasoning but less stodgy than most specimens around town. Crisp, thin tortilla chips can be dipped into two excellent spicy sauces - a red tomato-based chili sauce and a sprightly green tomatillo puree. Either sauce is a good addition to the bright, coarsely chopped guacamole, which is otherwise bland. Those sauces also brighten the nachos, whether the broiled tortilla chips are topped with chicken, cheese or beef.
1983-08-07	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"In the Craft World, Christmas Is Now Jay's Yarns, a business begun 48 years ago in Yonkers that moved to Hartsdale after a fire, reopened in Yonkers across from the Post Office on South Broadway in 1977. But the Hartsdale location offers by far the larger selection of materials for knitting, crocheting, needlepoint or tapestry, crewel embroidery, latch hooking for rugs, candle wicking, string art and holiday-gift preparation, with finished samples of each craft displayed for inspiration and for sale to anyone in a hurry.

In the craft business, the Christmas season is now - Styrofoam double bells or boots to decorate, fabric mantel stockings to stitch with names or add glitter, and needlepoint to do for tree ornaments. The holiday tablecloths with prestamped designs for embroidery are permanent press and can be oval, round, square or rectangular - 10 percent is deducted now on the marked prices of all kits beyond the initial 20 percent off - there are napkin kits to match."
1983-08-07	A POPULAR WATERFRONT SPOT	WATERFRONT dining has a special appeal in the summer, and it would be hard to find a more serenely pretty spot than a waterside table at Allen's Clam and Lobster House, overlooking Old Mill Pond in Westport. Now if you want a view, that is one thing. If it is seafood, that is something else. Allen's specializes in seafood, much of it broiled and fried. It can be extremely satisfying. More often, it can disappoint. Much depends on how carefully you choose.
1983-08-07	SOME SHORT CUTS AMIDS ELEGANCE	IT was over three years ago that L'Endroit in East Hills moved to its present location. It is still as elegant as ever, the dining room warmly intimate with each table bathed in a pool of light from a small lamp. Mirrored panels visually enlarge the space, lace curtains cover the windows and table settings are tastefully formal. The menu remains strictly Continental, accomplished with ingredients that are usually of high quality. While memorable dishes can enhance a meal, the general level of preparation is often quite pedestrian and undistinguished. Some unfortunate short cuts are also being used these days.
1983-08-07	JEWELERS CHANGE POLICIES ON CREDIT	At Tiffany & Company, charge-account customers now have a plastic card to call their own - in Tiffany's distinctive blue. At Harry Winston, in the last three months clients have been able to put their purchases on American Express cards. And at Cartier, starting Sept. 1, those who wish to purchase an item costing less than $1,000 but who do not want to pay by cash or check will be able to use any of four charge cards: American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard or Visa. They can no longer use their Cartier charge accounts for such purchases, but when they exceed the $1,000 price tag, they will be able to use either the Cartier account or a credit card.
1983-07-31	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"First-Quality Wares Up to 75% Off

Georg Jensen Inc., established 24 years ago in Eastchester's Vernon Hills Shopping Center, which has a Scarsdale mailing address, is in search of a new home nearby after the loss of its lease. Until notified that it must vacate the premises, however, wares from an extensive inventory are on display at a minimum of 25 percent off, much is 50 percent off and some reductions are up to 75 percent, all first quality.

The stock is a feast for the eyes both in design and presentation - faceted and clear crystal arrayed along the southern window wall, stemware and barware, dinner sets of china and porcelain, tea, coffee and espresso sets, oven-to-table ware, wooden salad bowls and cutting boards and stainless steel flatware. Also sterling and gold jewelry at half price and one-quarter off the earlier charges for necklaces, pendants and rings of Russian malachite, Danish amber, tiger eyes, amethyst, rose quartz, lapis lazuli, pearls and cloisonne; sterling and silver-plated picture frames; and Georg Jensen Christmas and Mother's Day plates and limited-edition Haviland Limoges plates. All prices quoted are after reductions."
1983-07-31	"DINING OUT;
EXPLORING THE STATE'S RESORT AREAS"	"WHEN visiting resort areas, it is easy enough to find a large restaurant on the main thoroughfare, but small eating places tucked away on side streets are often jealously guarded by the local gentry. 

The Sandpiper, which opened almost a year ago, is situated in a small hotel in Spring Lake that is just a half-block from the ocean.  It has the uncluttered look of a shore restaurant - a ceramic tile floor, uncurtained louvered glass windows, painted wooden tables with place mats, paper napkins and a few hanging plants.

Unfortunately, because there isn't a soft surface anywhere to absorb the sound, the restaurant has the acoustics of a Y.M.C.A.  swimming pool."
1983-07-31	SUMMERTIME SETTING ON THE PORCH	USUALLY the drive to the restaurant is not the part you look forward to, but with The Cook on Shelter Island it's a different story. Unless you are a resident of the bit of hilly landfall nestled between the Island's two forks, the trip will involve a ride on the ferry from Greenport or North Haven and, either coming or going, you may catch the sunset over the water. It's the stuff of romance. The restaurant itself is pure summertime, the old-fashioned onthe-porch kind, with no air-conditioning. Spinning fans move the air about the wide open interior of the Victorian building, but it still can be sultry. It has always been puzzling how few summer restaurants offer cold entrees - a cold poached fish or stuffed breast of veal, for example - as if people might not think they were getting their money's worth or the chef feels a lack of accomplishment unless a plate of hot, just-cooked food is served.
1983-07-24	"DINING OUT;
SUMMERTIME ON THE SHREWSBURY"	"WATCHING the sunset from the deck of The Waterfront on a summer evening, one truly feels away from it all. This year-old restaurant is situated at Sea Bright's Navoo Marina, on the spit of land between the Shrewsbury River and the Atlantic; in fact, it is right at the docks where luxury cabin cruisers bob at their moorings.

Reservations are not accepted, and so it is worth while going to this informal restaurant at off-peak times to get a table on the covered deck. Neither the cramped bar nor the inside dining room holds much appeal."
1983-07-24	SPANISH FOOD WITH FEW SURPRISES	LA ZARZUELA in Rockville Centre is an extremely popular Spanish restaurant that has been open since 1981. It is an attractive place with rough white stucco walls accented with light wood, decorative Spanish tiles, copper and wrought iron. The country look is softened by plush dark blue upholstery and carpeting. The menu offers a listing that is fairly typical of most Spanish restaurants. Few surprises. Shrimp in garlic sauce, gazpacho, paella, mixed seafood in green sauce, flan and sangria are available for sure. But it is not in its predictable selection that the restaurant falls short. The problem is the utter blandness of the food that should be vibrant and forcefully seasoned, as well as the carelessness of a number of preparations.
1983-07-24	NEW JAPANESE DISHES ON THE MENU	ICHI RIKI'S entranceway of white stones, bamboo and natural wood shoji promises serenity, in sharp contrast to Nyack's lively Main Street. Three tatami rooms, a sushi counter seating 10 and two areas for Western-style dining provide an appropriate atmosphere for some well-made, authentic Japanese dishes. Since its opening two years ago, John Koshiba, the owner, has worked at his menu, balancing the familiar dishes from Japanese cuisine with some unusual ones rarely found in these parts. There are still some rough spots to be smoothed, inconsistencies to be corrected; however, some important improvements made since our first visit warrant a new rating.
1983-07-24	UNDERSTATED STYLE IN NEW HAVEN	YOU know you are in Whistler's when you see a photographic blowup of the artist's mother near the entrance. Located in a below-ground, recessed building in New Haven between the Yale Repertory Theater and the Yale Center for British Art, Whistler's is a modern, stylish cafe and informal restaurant that seems an extension of the previous restaurant on the premises, West of Eleven. Dubonnet-colored carpet and booths and cane-seated chairs with wooden arms stained the same color, gray walls with period posters, plants dangling from the front windows and crisp white tablecloths on well-spaced tables add up to an inviting, understated place to dine. In warm weather, the tables outside in the courtyard adjoining the stairs are popular, though we prefer the quieter interior. The young staff members seem well trained, unobtrusively efficient and friendly.
1983-07-17	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Clowns, Free Popcorn And Markdowns

Mount Kisco's Sidewalk Sale days will be from Thursday through Saturday, with clowns, an itinerant banjo player, and free popcorn and balloons lending an old-fashioned flavor to the markdowns at 45 sidewalk booths. In addition, five local banks subsidize the use of booths by individual charities. The booths are marked by umbrellas, the hours are 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. and the parking is free.

Limited Unlimited is one of the participating stores and will have gold and silver rings, earrings, bracelets and chains among its discounted wares. Ordinarily it is not a discount shop, but rather a source for individually designed special orders, from diamond rings to silver leg rings for showbirds, and jewelry repairs."
1983-07-17	"DINING OUT;
A TASTE OF BRITAIN IN MONMOUTH"	"THE Fox and Hounds, a restaurant in the Monmouth County community of Colts Neck, was listed in the telephone book many months before it actually opened last December. There was also a large advertisement stating that traditional English meals would be served on Sundays.

Although there are restaurants in New Jersey serving food representing practically every country one can name, to the best of my knowledge genuine English food does not exist in the state outside of a fish and chips shop in Kearny.

This fact, coupled with the information that an English consultant had been brought over, made us anxious to try this restaurant, hoping that it would dispel the myth about inedible British food."
1983-07-17	SERIOUS AIMS IN A RUSTIC SETTING	NEITHER the name, Wee Tappee Inn, nor the neon sign outside the small stucco building suggests that the establishment inside is a fairly elaborate Italian-Continental restaurant. Thanks to dark wood paneling and exposed beams, the small L-shaped dining room, dominated on one side by a large bar, has a pleasantly rustic look. Contrasted by formal table appointments, it creates an attractive country dining atmosphere. It is evident that this is a restaurant that takes itself very seriously, but irritating carelessness tends to mar the picture from time to time. The gracious atmosphere is not enhanced by loud radio music complete with announcements, nor are first impressions, before the food arrives, improved by having bread that was burned in the course of warming included in the bread basket. There are more choices on the menu than there are seats in the house. While some of the preparation is commendably fine, the standard is not consistently maintained.
1983-07-17	A NEW MENU, BUT STILL TERRIFIC	OWNERS may come and go, but Bon Appetit in Westport seems to go on forever. The former owner, Dolly Deaty, set a standard of excellence. Open only for lunch, with a limited menu, the restaurant was remarkable for its high level of consistency and quality. The new proprietor, Bruce Butte, has a more ambitious plan. Bon Appetit now serves dinner four nights a week, and both lunch and dinner menus have expanded considerably. Mr. Butte has extended the lunch menu, adding a number of fresh and imaginative salads, and continuing the still very good ''Dolly basics'' of soups, omelets and quiches. The five-course prix fixe dinner menu consists of six diverse entree choices. Both lunch and dinner menus change weekly, depending on the season's bounty.
1983-07-15	New tandoori and old Continental.	GULMORE is the latest addition to the growing restaurant scene on Second Avenue between 80th and 85th Streets. A tiny, two-month-old Indian restaurant with a tandoori oven, it holds promise for inexpensive meals in an attractive, relaxed setting. Gulmore features the mildly spiced Mogul cooking of northern India, but you may want to ask for hotter seasoning. The restaurant shines with its vegetable dishes, breads, soups and appetizers. But its meats and seafoods in sauces are frequently overcooked; so are some of the tandoor offerings. The meal starts with two of the restaurant's more piquant sauces. One, sweet with tamarinds, the other, spicy with mint, peppers, onion and coriander, are served with peppery, crisp wafer (papad) as soon as you sit down. An especially good opener is the appetizer platter, which contains crisp, deep-fried, greaseless vegetables and chicken; chicken chat, cubes of marinated chicken, refreshingly fragrant with coriander, and kati kebab, ''chapati'' bread filled with coriander-seasoned lamb.
1983-07-10	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"World of Variety In One Village

For several years The Yellow Monkey Village at Cross River has provided a pastoral shopping enclave, with antiques from several continents, gifts, candy, flowers, plants, art, jewelry, cooking wares and gourmet foods. July is sale time for all the shops around the green. The hours are uniform - 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Tuesday through Sunday - and the parking is free.

The location is four miles east of I-684 on Route 35, just at the junction of 35 with Route 121. Nearby is the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation and Trail Museum, so a trip could mix indoor shopping for some with outdoor activity for the rest."
1983-07-10	WATERFRONT DINING: A CRITICS' CHOICES	WHEELING gulls; pilot boats, yachts, barges, sailboats, tankers and speedboats; glittery river and bridge lights: food eaten by the water always seems to taste better. Westchester County may lack the throbbing shores of Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey, but just as stirring to soul and appetite are the tranquil waters of the Hudson River, the Long Island Sound and a number of silvery lakes. During these long days of summer, when the sun takes its time moving over the horizon, diners can linger over drinks or dinner on breezy decks or in glass-walled dining rooms witnessing the whole technicolor, kaleidoscopic collaboration of water and sky. We have limited our selection of waterfront restaurants to those situated right at the water's edge, excluding for this article places that have an eagle's eye view as well as those separated from the water by railroad tracks or thoroughfares. With an attempt to balance the quality of the food with the joys of the view, we present the restaurants in order of our preference. Whether from its deck and strollable grounds or from the gardenlike glassed-in dining rooms, The Chart House in Dobbs Ferry provides a suitable placed to enjoy both food and view. Laminated, mat-faced table tops, photo murals of watersports and ocean memorabilia complete the decor.
1983-07-10	IN BETHEL, AN INTERNATIONAL MENU	MAYBE it is the influx of new corporations, such as Union Carbide and others. Whatever the reason, the Danbury area recently has had a flowering of new restaurants. The spillover even extends a few miles south to the town of Bethel. One of Bethel's new and most attractive places to dine is Dickson's, three small rooms of a refurbished clapboard house opposite the train depot. You enter the restaurant through the tiny bar, from a large parking lot in the rear.
1983-07-10	SAMPLING THE FARE AT A NEW HOTEL	THE spacious and elegant Polo Grill, which occupies one side of the lobby of the new Garden City Hotel, offers one of the more gracious dining settings on the Island. The two-level area, defined by low marble partitions, planters and gleaming brass railings, is plushly decorated with comfortable chairs and banquets in tones of beige and rose. Tables are roomy and well-spaced; lighting is soft and accented by pinpoints of candles in the evenings. A skylight provides a flood of daylight at lunch. This restaurant has been serving food since April but, like the hotel itself, it is still evolving and undergoing changes of management. A new executive chef, Patrick Pinon from La Recolte in Manhattan, started work several weeks ago.
1983-07-03	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Fun Things To Do With Fiber

Yarn Blenders in White Plains deals in what might be thought of as ''recombinant'' fibers, unusual options in custom-mixing from a bulk cone supply of domestic and imported wool, cotton, acrylic and silk in varying textures, all at discounted prices. In addition, the shop bought out the entire ''hold closet'' for the convenience of longtime customers when the owner of Scarsdale's Knit & Purl shop retired, and added other stock to be sold at reduced prices - even needles are 10 percent off the printed prices from the manufacturers.

The fun of the shop, however, is in the creative mixing and matching of textures and fibers by means of two electrified backwinders dating back to the Industrial Revolution and two manual machines. The process allows a subtle combining of colors, loops and bumps to personal taste, with greater savings from the cone supply, somewhat less when a prepackaged ball or skein is chosen for tone, content or texture."
1983-07-03	MAKING A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY	DESPITE its name, Le Shack d'Alsace approaches with timidity that robust provincial cuisine, one that weds German heaviness with French subtlety. This union is not as absurd as it might first appear. The quality of the soil plays a great role in defining the limits of a region's cooking, and Lorraine and Alsace, joined as they are by the Vosges Mountains, share the poor harvest of a rocky, wooded terrain. One can understand why Waverley Root calls this area The Domain of Fat. Poor soil and hard winters call for sturdy food on both sides of the mountain range, and the peasants have learned to make a virtue of necessity, combining lowly turnips, cabbages and potatoes with sausages, pork products and plump geese for unsophisticated but highly satisfying flavor. The most marvelous transformation, for instance, the rich foie gras, must have resulted from an after-thefact warning to waste not.
1983-07-03	BEEF IN VARIOUS CUTS IS A SPECIALITY	FOR a restaurant that emphasizes beef in its name, Luca's Steak House in Greenwich has a surprisingly diversified menu, including quite a number of seafood choices. Even the decor is not the usual steak house image. Pale coral walls with dark wood paneling, colonial-style brass chandeliers, decorative paintings and fresh daisies in milk-glass bud vases, all create a comfortable setting for dinner. The staff is attentive, and the owner seems genuinely happy to greet and welcome the guests at each table. (Our lunch visit was less auspicious, with wilted or dead flowers on every table, and a waitress who was distracted, forgetful and prone to mixing up orders.) Yet, for all the accouterments, Luca's is first and foremost a steak house, and if you order steak, that is what you will get. Whether filet mignon, porterhouse or New York cut T-bone, the quality is good, and the preparation is as rare, medium or well done as you desire.
1983-07-03	INTERESTING FOOD AND PIAF SONGS	THE songs of Piaf, Aznavour and Brassens fill the air in the Cafe Pompidou, a new restaurant-bistro in Southampton. Framed pages of French comic strips cover the walls, and the yellow ashtrays and beach umbrellas placed about advertise Ricard. The atmosphere is very French. It also has a casual summertime gaiety about it (but if the day's a scorcher, the ventilation may be inadequate). What was formerly the Anchorage restaurant has been brightened with many coats of white paint and enlivened with pink accents. Tablecloths are overlaid with white paper, and crayons are provided for doodlers. These come in handy when the intervals between courses stretch beyond reasonable expectations.
1983-07-01	Charming bistro and Tex-Mex pair	ONE of the more charming and ingratiating little French restaurants in Greenwich Village is La Ripaille, opened three years ago by Patrick and Alain Laurent, and their wives, Theresa and Nelly, who are in charge of the kitchen. This small bistro has maintained its rustic and charming setting, with wooden beams, bits of tapestry and graceful bouquets. And because the food is much better than it used to be, a promotion from one star to two is in order. La Ripaille, a 16th-century French word meaning a feast or revelry, was well named, for there is very good food in this handsome room. The earlier flaw of underseasoning seems to have been corrected, perhaps indicating that with success comes self-assurance, although there is a tendency toward overacidity in some sauces. The staff is friendly and efficient, if sometimes confused. Lighting could be brighter in the back of the dining room, and menus should be more legible.
1983-06-26	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"A Walloping Sale Before a Closing

North Avenue in New Rochelle has been a discount shopping area for about 33 years, six days each week, anchored on the southern end by Remin's, with Bolton's the northern limit just past the Iona College main gate. The other shops come and go -mainly women's apparel, shoes and accessories - and only Remin's closes for the summer after a walloping sale of everything, this year ending July 2 at 4 P.M.

1983-06-26	A LONG MENU EMPHASIZING HUNAN	ACCORDING to the menu, the kirin, namesake of the Chinese restaurant in Manhasset called Kirin Palace, is a gentle mythical beast and a harbinger of happy times. If you are at all superstititous, it should make the restaurant more appealing. The contemporary decorations of light wood paneling, applied on the diagonal, and Breuer-style chairs have been left in place from the previous tenant, Secret Sea, a Chinese seafood restaurant. The menu at Kirin Palace, which runs for pages, is considerably broader, representing many provincial cuisines but emphasizing Hunan. Plan to study the menu while you have cocktails in order to begin to arrive at your choices.
1983-06-26	SPOT AT A BUSY CROSSROADS	ONE of the questions about restaurant reviewing that readers often ask is how we decide which establishments to review. More often than not, they are surprised to learn that we visit almost twice as many restaurants as we write up; quite a few prove unworthy of further consideration after an exploratory visit. Places, plain and fancy, that serve wholesome, carefully prepared food with some consistency -critic's paradise - crop up all too infrequently. Many times we must sift through a coarser screen and consider those restaurants whose location or unusual cuisine or welcoming ambience, for example, would draw a potential diner's interest; and that means evaluating some less-than-perfect kitchens.
1983-06-26	ELEGANT PASTRIES AND GOOD SERVICE	THOUGH its name - Versailles - evokes visions of monumental, formal grandeur, the small, L-shaped, palm-festooned restaurant in the Harbor Plaza complex on Shippan Point in Stamford has the spirit of an informal, light-hearted cafe or bistro. This impression is enhanced by the hanging plants and Parisian scenes that line the white walls, and by the youthful, friendly and competent service. One wishes that the restaurant's only view, of a large parking lot, was screened by cafe curtains. The restaurant is actually related to a small bakery-cum-lunch spot in Greenwich. In fact, at the entrance of the Stamford establishment is a large bakery case where quiches and desserts may be purchased.
1983-06-26	SPENDING IN GILDED STYLE	ANTHONY V. MILONE got an expensive new suit when he became vice p resident of a new medical products company in Tuckahoe, N.Y., last y ear. He also got an American Express Gold Card. ''We're a small company,'' he said. ''But it pays to make the client think you're doing better than you really are. If your shoes are shiny, and you dress well, it can help. And if at the end of a luncheon you pull out a Gold Card, that's one more thing. People want to be associated with success.'' Jean Meger, a businesswoman in Anaheim, Calif., takes that strategy a step further. She places her Gold Card or her Visa Preferred card discreetly on the table before she orders at a restaurant, and leaves it there during the meal. ''You get better service,'' she said. ''And if you want to impress someone, it's a nice flash.''
1983-06-22	EXECUTIVE CHANGES	* American Broadcasting Companies has named Michael P. Mallardi executive vice president and chief financial officer, Everett H. Erlick executive vice president and general counsel and Mark Cohen senior vice president. * Beker Industries, Greenwich, Conn., has named Lawrence B. Kessler senior vice president.
1983-06-19	HIGH-CALIBER HUNAN IN GREENWICH	QUESTION: Can Fairfield County absorb yet another Hunan Chinese restaurant? Answer: Yes, if it is of the caliber of Hunan Gourmet, a six-month-old newcomer to the Post Road in Greenwich. In spite of the dozens of Hunan-style restaurants that have sprung up in the area over the past two years, Hunan Gourmet offers some attractive variations on a familiar theme. Perhaps this is because this is the first and only restaurant of the owner-manager, Tommy Chu, and he brings considerable experience from years as maitre d'hotel at Uncle Tai's and David Keh's in New York. The decor is simple and unobtrusive. You enter through a ''moon gate'' arch from the foyer into a plant-festooned dining room. On the beige wallpapered walls are bamboo prints, and at the end of the room, a huge photo blowup of flaming maple trees in autumn.
1983-06-19	ALL THE WORLD'S THE STAGE	NESTLED at the Hudson River's edge with long, dumbfunding views of the great river and the highlands of Storm King and Crows Nest Mountains, Cold Spring has a unique charm, one due not only to its natural beauty. Although settled about 100 years before, the stageset village bustled by 1818, when the opening of the West Point Foundry - then the country's largest - brought 2,000 colonizers to the area. Since then concerned residents and busy historicalpreservation societies have successfully resisted newfangledness and have encouraged clean-as-a-whistle restorations allowing minimal adaptions to the needs of present-day living. And so the pretty old brick and wood houses market their past as antique shops, restaurants, old clothing stores and such. Last year after painstaking restoration, the Hudson House Inn (built in 1837, the third hotel in the state) opened its period guest rooms and public rooms and restaurant. The restaurant's major asset is the panoramic view. Inside, Colonial country grace calls for wide plank floors, pewter, primitive prints of animals and print-on-print decor in linens, wallpaper and draperies. Not surprising, the entire backdrop upstages the food, which falters in its nonetheless welcome innovations. The restaurant is clearly trying to merit the town, the river and the mountains.
1983-06-19	HOW COLLEGE STUDENTS ESTABLISH CREDIT	WHEN Stephen G. Kaplan was a junior at Rice University in Houston, he wanted a department store credit c ard, but did not apply for one. ''I didn't think I'd be able to get c redit because I had no credit record,'' he said. But later, a representative of a major Houston department store approached him on campus and solicited his application. It was accepted even though Mr. Kaplan's credit history consisted of a small savings and checking account and part-time work in a luggage shop.
1983-06-19	STYLISH SETTING, AMBITIOUS KITCHEN	AFTER a few months of operation, Le Petit Pourvoyeur, a stylish little bandbox of a restaurant in Bellmore, finally seems to be headed in the right direction. Three partners in the small place are recent graduates of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, one of the leading professional culinary schools in the country. The high quality of their training is evident, but so is their lack of experience. These young men are so sincere, creative and enthusiastic that one has to wish them well and hope they can succeed in their ambitious venture. But had they spent more time in worthwhile apprenticeship, they might have been able to hone their basic skills more effectively. As it is, they are receiving plenty of on-the-job training.
1983-06-12	COZY AND ETHNIC IN WESTPORT	MARIKA'S, yet another newcomer to the Westport scene, is one of those tiny, homey restaurants that is easy to like. What makes Marika's especially appealing is that it features ethnic specialties rare in this part of Connecticut: Polish, Hungarian and Russian. There are a few American and international dishes as well, and at lunchtime sandwiches, salads and omelets. Everything in the long, narrow dining room has a lovingly assembled look, from the flowers stenciled on the plain wooden table tops to the natural pine shelves with artful displays of dried flowers, utensils and folk art. Fresh flowers in milk-glass bud vases on each table, an old-fashioned cupboard against one white stucco wall, and comfortable bentwood chairs all contribute to a warm sense of welcome. The feeling of coziness is enhanced by a friendly staff, which makes up in cheerfulness for sometimes inadequate knowledge of the restaurant's menu.
1983-06-12	FROM TEAROOM TO FRENCH RESTAURANT	EARLIER this spring, La Maison des Champs moved from the rear of a small shopping center in Water Mill to a more visible location on the highway in East Hampton. In the years since it first opened in Water Mill, it had gradually matured from a charming tearoom to a more serious French restaurant. This evolution has continued with the move to East Hampton. Nicole Grossman, who owns the restaurant with her husband and who was the original chef, now shares the front-of-the-house responsibilities with him. They are cordial, friendly and correct. The new chef, who did a commendable job last season at the Bull's Head Inn in Bridgehampton, is performing with similar distinction here. Even early in this phase of its operation, La Maison des Champs shows great promise.
1983-06-10	A theater choice and a river view.	ORSO, the newest addition to the rapidly changing scene on Restaurant Row, 46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, offers a decent, pleasant and moderate-price option for light and heavy meals, before and after theater. Adjacent to Joe Allen's hamburger pub, and under the same management, the casual and attractive dining room, with its skylight and open kitchen, suggests a country courtyard, a style that is enhanced by colorfully decorated mix-match earthenware. Lighting at night is a bit gloomy, but the tone set by staff and customers is friendly, relaxed and convivial. The food at this two-month-old restaurant is best described as Italianate - almost as though standard recipes were adapted to a preppy palate. The chef, Julie Lumia, is Joe Allen's daughter, and she tends to overcook food so that textures are too soft. Seasonings are tentative, occasionally overcomplicated. Even so, there are enough good choices to add up to a satisfying meal for anyone who wants to eat in this area.
1983-06-05	"DINING OUT;
A FLOWERY SETTING IN PLAINFIELD"	"THE shaped-glass front of Lily Greenleaves in Plainfield makes the place look more like a greenhouse full of hanging plants than a restaurant. However, a closer look reveals plastic plants and the sort of bric-a-brac (old wooden sleds, etc.) usually found in a second-hand store. Inside, however, the plants are real.

A small dining room in front with booths and tables has a slight garden feel to it, but very poor lighting. Behind it is a narrow dining area that is little more than a corridor with tables. This leads to the bar and lounge."
1983-06-05	A POPULAR PLACE FOR THE FAMILY	''IS the restaurant new?'' we asked our waitress at lunch. ''Sort of ...it opened a few months ago,'' she said. A few days later at dinner in the same place, we asked another waitress how old the restaurant was. ''Eleven years,'' was the reply. In a sense, both answers were right. The Darien restaurant in question is Reuben's, but it supplants - in name anyway - an establishment called The Plank House. The ownership remains the same, a nationwide company that evidently decided to make all its restaurants conform to the same name - Reuben's. Decor and menu have changed somewhat, we were told, but never having visited The Plank House, we cannot verify this.
1983-06-05	COMING OF AGE IN MAMARONECK	OPEN only three months, Mamaroneck's American Bistro, even in its nonage indicates that its coming of age is worth watching for. As the name suggests, the small, informal restaurant serves an Americanization of Continental cuisine. Much of its fresh food is cooked to order; in fact, everything except the bread is made here, and the enthusiastic chef, Mark Kaplan, expects to make that as soon as he and his co-owner, Nancy Gedney, who manages the dining room, settle in. The cooking is New American, less fussy than New French cuisine, but both share the same approach: the food is light and subtly flavored with herbs and vegetables; salt and complicated thick cream sauces eschewed. Someone is bothering to taste the food before it reaches the tables, a comment we wish we could make more often.
1983-06-05	ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS IS FINESSE	ADD the new San Remo in Westbury to your list of small, attractive Italian restaurants that interpret the northern Italian repertory with a certain elegance. When the chef puts his mind to it, the food is light, perfectly cooked and seasoned with finesse. Lapses that occur do not seriously diminish the overall pleasure of dining here. The restaurant is like a double storefront with a small bar and a few tables on one side and a dining room divided in thirds on the other. The central part of the dining room, which is mirrored, skylighted and hung with plants, is more arresting but less intimate than the somewhat austere, light wood-paneled areas on either side. Light wood, plants and mirrors have definitely become the fashionable restaurant decorating scheme, providing the background for dining in restaurants of every stripe from singles gathering places to Chinese or Japanese to French and now Italian.
1983-05-29	Careful Shopper	"Prices to Cotton To At Cottontails

Cottontails in Larchmont is putting everything except toys and books on 20 percent sale during the entire month of June. It is ordinarily a full-price retail shop for layette through preschool natural-fiber clothing up to toddler 4, but by fall will expand its offerings to size 6X. No synthetics are carried.

A few fancy dresses are $30, but more ''grandmother dresses'' are $40 to $80, with the all-silk designs as high as $112, presale, including heavily smocked Dodie Originals, Nicole Ruiz designs, Wibbies Inc. from Washington, Nantucket Designs, Marimekko and Cary."
1983-05-29	Dining Out; TASTEFUL GOOD LOOKS IN SCARSDALE	THOSE who admired the elegantly appointed Frog Prince Proper should not be too disappointed with Chase Landing, the premises' new occupant. The tasteful decor remains, although some of the dramatic impact of stark, gorgeous simplicity has been lost with the addition not only of floral prints, attractive but cluttery, but also of tables. Dining tables, for instance, now fill half the space of the once-soigne entry room. We recommend refusing a table in this room, where the management's convenience overrides that of the diner. The real difficulty is that Chase Landing does not take reservations for dinner. Seated in that room, one is privy to the greeting of guests, the apologies for a 20 or 30 minute wait, the constantly bleating telephone. Waiting diners spill in from the small bar and corridor, bumping chairs in their maneuverings. We might as well have been in a coffee shop.
1983-05-29	INSIDE CITICORP	Standing TALL IN HIS CORNER OFFICE, looking down on Park Avenue from the 15th floor, Walter B. Wriston, chairman of Citicorp, offered this comment on his 13 years in the job: ''Whether you think it's good or bad, we've changed the environment.'' It was a large claim, modestly stated, and it was indisputable. When Wriston joined First National City Bank, Citicorp's predecessor, he recalled, ''I sat at a rolltop desk and waited for customers.'' Back then, in 1946, most bankers were careful, stodgy types who provided safe harbors for their depositors' money and served as exemplars of American thrift and probity. Today, the major banks take big risks in search of big profits and hawk their wares unashamedly. They are run by ambitious, aggressive businessmen. And more than any man, the Citicorp chairman - an unabashed apostle of laissez-faire capitalism - is responsible for that change.
1983-05-29	ONLY PASTA, BUT NOT ITALIAN	PASTAPOT in Glen Cove is the realization of a concept that has every reason for success. A restaurant that serves only pasta dishes - dominated by but not limited to the Italian repertory - in pleasantly comfortable surroundings has to have universal appeal these days, especially when entrees range from $3.95 to $9.95, with half of them at $5.95. Add to these features portions that are ample with well-seasoned sauces and an interesting and moderately priced wine list with more than one wine available by the glass, and it would appear that the place does not miss. Unfortunately, there are a couple of serious flaws in this otherwise attractive formula. One of them can be tolerated and perhaps might be avoided with proper planning, but the other could only be corrected by changing the very nature of this operation.
1983-05-29	Dining Out; GOOD VALUE IN AN INFORMAL SETTING	AS though running a popular bakery, gourmet takeout and culinary supply shop, a catering business and a cooking school were not enough full-time jobs, Ann Howard of Farmington has now opened a restaurant. Its name, Apricots, evokes thoughts of good food, easy informality and a certain trendiness. The restaurant, or ''juicy pub,'' as its owner calls it, is located in a two-story building overlooking the Farmington River. When you enter, the first sight to greet your eyes is a huge glass jar of preserved apricots, invitingly simple and designed not for sampling but to whet your appetite. A small waiting room is opposite a long, narrow pub-like bar where live piano music is featured most evenings.
1983-05-27	WHERE TO DINE ON YOUR HOLIDAY WEEKEND EXCURSION	Merely getting into the car for a weekend outing is enough to make some people hungry. But even if you're not one of those, it is a good idea to plan where to eat before setting off on an excursion to areas surrounding New York City. There are picturesque and gracious country inns, waterfront restaurants, places with elegant food - and wine lists to match - to choose from. The restaurant critics for the Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Weekly sections have recommended some of their favorite country restaurants. All are open today, tomorrow, Sunday and Monday, and throughout the summer for dinner, and many serve lunch or brunch as well. If you know your plans in advance, make reservations at restaurants that accept them, because weekends are the busiest time. But if your proposed route or schedule should change, remember to call and cancel. New Jersey Dining in the provinces has its hazards, because each restaurant is so far removed from the next that you may end up settling for just a meal rather than driving an hour more to find a preferable place. Also, this holiday weekend, many restaurants are keeping to their regular Sunday or Monday closing day, including some New Jersey favorites. Still, there are at least five restaurants in different areas that will be open every day and that serve food ranging from decent to very good.
1983-05-27	West Side Thai, East Side French.	THE theater district, long considered a wasteland by lovers of good food, is starting to offer brighter prospects for pleasant, moderate-price meals. One welcome addition is the Siam Grill on Ninth Avenue, between 42d and 43d Streets, an offshoot of Bangkok Cuisine on Eighth Avenue. This six-month-old restaurant is small and more trimly attractive than most Thai restaurants, and its young staff is gracious, efficient and accommodating. Although many of the dishes are too wet and too bland, there are more than enough well-seasoned, savory dishes to allow for several very good lunches or dinners. An unusual feature for a Thai restaurant is a big grill, glassed off in the dining room. One of its best specialties is chicken gai yang, first marinated in a spicy sauce and then broiled to moist, crunchy perfection. The chicken is better than grilled ribs (called baby ribs on the menu, but actually not the tiny, lean back ribs that this term implies). Although fairly meaty, the ribs are spoiled by pineapple juice, which has an unpleasant flavor when hot. Another well-broiled dish is a tender beef satay appetizer with sesame sauce. Also good as a first course is tod mun pla, patties of light, curry-spiced fried kingfish, with a cucumber sauce for textural interest. Egg rolls are greasy and overdone.
1983-05-22	"Dining Out;
ROCKLAND: FRENCH AND ITALIAN FARE"	"LA CAPANNINA INN, which is just over the state line in the Rockland County community of Spring Valley, N.Y., is housed in an old building that dates from the early 18th century. The inn was originally owned by a Dutchman, Abraham Garret Haring, but since the 1930's it has functioned as a restaurant under various proprietors.

Marlene and Gerard Seybold, who are natives of Alsace, France, are the present owners. Under their guidance, the restaurant offers a menu that lists a combination of country French and Italian dishes, with the emphasis on hearty rather than delicate."
1983-05-22	NEAR PLAYLAND, 'TEX-MEX' DISHES	WITH the approaching warm weather signaling, among other things, the reopening of Rye's Playland, it is of interest to note that during the last year Alamo, a restaurant serving ''Tex-Mex'' food, has opened just south of Playland Parkway. Dishes such as steak, burgers and ribs done on a char-broiler appear on the menu, along with those that, in these parts, pass for Mexican. And as in other places in the county that offer this type of cuisine, the efforts of Alamo's kitchen lacked consistency. The kitchen produced some dishes of such startingly disparate quality that it is difficult to believe that the hand turning out luscious pollo al cilantro - luxuriously thick, juicy chicken cutlet of exceptionally fine flavor and texture, sprinkled with fragrant cilantro (or coriander) leaves - is also responsible for using mucid avocado in guacamole and preparing enchiladas like papyrus. Occupying the lower level of a tree-surrounded house, the neat dining room has white stucco walls contrasting with those of fieldstone. A sun god mask and bright Mexican serapes and hats adorn the walls. Practical chocolate-brown vinyl table coverings set off multicovered napkins fanning out of water glasses. A partially screened bar with video games can be noisy at times, but securing a table at the opposite end of the dining room solved this problem. In general, Alamo is a restful stopping place, particularly after a day of Playland's honky-tonk.
1983-05-22	A FULL MENU AND DAILY SPECIALTIES	OVER a period of several years, the Chalet in Roslyn seemed to be developing a kitchen capable of distinction in a provincial French style. Recently, however, although the charm of the place has not diminished, there has been a falling off in terms of the care and consistency with which the food is prepared. At the same time, the wine list has become more sophisticated under the direction of the restaurant's manager, a man of particular expertise. The result is usually a dinner that is extremely pleasant in most respects, if less than thrilling. Since its inception, the Chalet has served a bowl of crudites with a garlic dip as a preprandial nibble. It is still an appreciated touch. The menu seems to grow longer with each visit, so that it now stretches on and on with about two dozen entrees including nightly specials, some of which are fairly complicated. One cannot help but wonder whether such a list in a relatively small restaurant might be part of the problem, making it more difficult to perfect and refine the preparations and seasonings.
1983-05-22	GOOD BUT INCONSISTANT CHINESE	OUR experiences at the new Chinese restaurant in Norwalk, Mandarin East, point up the vagaries of dining out. The first evening, our dinner was a series of pleasant surprises. Unusual Sichuan dishes - sauteed spicy string beans (crunchy and cidery), beef with ginger root (tantalizingly aromatic), and sha-cha lamb (pleasingly hot with a mix of straw mushrooms, broccoli and flower-shaped carrot slices) - were well seasoned, freshly made and thoroughly delectable. Dining just four nights later was totally different. It was as though a new kitchen crew had taken over: sesame beef thatshould have been spicy was bland, and other dishes were just plain poorly cooked. Grape fish was dessicated and swimming in a cornstarch-thickened sweet sauce. Lemon chicken had been deep fried in a lifeless batter, reheated and served in a lemon sauce so thick and ''set'' it could have passed as a lemon curd dessert.
1983-05-22	BANDITS WIELDING PLASTIC	WHEN Robert Benkowski, a Chase Manhattan vice president for credit card investigation, established a ''buy operation'' to break up a counterfeit credit card ring in New York City last year, one of his undercover agents approached a merchant with some cards that were clearly counterfeit. The merchant refused to accept them for purchases. ''But I can take you across the street,'' he offered. ''My brother will take all the cards you have.'' Thanks in large part to such complicity by dishonest merchants, credit card counterfeiting has become a booming business. ''Criminals don't have to go hold up a bank at gunpoint anymore,'' says Mr. Benkowski. In 1982, losses to American banks and credit card issuers from counterfeiting were estimated at between $40 million and $50 million worldwide, up from $15 million in 1981. In 1977, the figure was at only $66,000.
1983-05-19	AMERICAN EXPRESS EXPANDS SYSTEM OF TELLER MACHINES	In an effort to capture a larger share of the credit card market, American Express is expanding its automatic teller machine service to more regions of the country, as well as to nonbanking locations. In the process, it is drawing criticism from bankers, who say American Express is encroaching on their territory. The Express Cash system, first offered to all American Express members last summer, allows card holders to draw, for a $1 fee per transaction, up to $500 a week from 24-hour cash machines at 704 banks around the country. An additional 504 machines are to be added to the system in the near future. Of these, 289 will be installed at Publix Super Markets in Florida in an agreement reached with Sun Banks of Florida.
1983-05-15	DINING AT ITS BEST IN HARTFORD	EVEN the name of Hartford's newest and most dazzling restaurant seems inspired: L'Americain. While French, the name plays up the restaurant's nouvelle American cuisine. The two small dining rooms of this stylish restaurant (located in a beautifully rejuvenated 19th-century brick factory complex) are also subtly American, with colonial-style brass chandeliers. But for all the handsome accouterments (comfortable Queen Annestyle chairs, elegant white china with pewter-toned borders), it is the menu that commands center stage - and deserves it. The chef, Chris Pardue, was formerly sous chef at the Old Lyme Inn, and has brought with him that establishment's flair for combining the techniques of nouvelle cuisine with seasonal American foods -with memorable results. Anyone serious about food would be well advised to schedule a dinner stop here.
1983-05-13	Cafe cuisines, new and classic.	THIS week's restaurants have much in common. Both are casual, intimate bistros that are reasonable options in their neighborhoods, and both just miss deserving two-star ratings. Cafe New Amsterdam, on the corner of West Fourth and West 12th Streets, is a handsome and romantic setting with more or less nouvelle cuisine specialties. Some of the house creations are delicious, but many tend to be oversweet, bland and somewhat in the tearoom tradition. Cafe 58, on 58th Street between Second and Third Avenues, is a snug, traditional and inexpensive French bistro, somewhat in need of sprucing up. Its strength is in the lusty, bourgeois dishes not readily available elsewhere in New York. Its weaknesses are occasional staleness and generally inept interpretations of dishes cooked in advance. Understand the strong points of each cafe, and you can have pleasant dinners at both. Cafe New Amsterdam, opened six years, has gathered a loyal following of local Villagers and uptowners, many of whom arrive by limousine, especially on Saturday night. Darkly bright eggplant-color walls and fine prints of old New York (nee New Amsterdam) make this a graceful setting, which would be improved by more comfortable chairs. The staff is friendly and polite, but there is a marked slowdown for main courses, even when the restaurant is practically empty.
1983-05-08	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Handmade Selections At Up to 50% Off Handmade Gifts in Hartsdale Village stocks wares of American artisans and craftsmen, usually at full retail prices, but this month there are 20 to 50 percent reductions on selected categories. The markdowns precede the Circus Day sidewalk sale May 14 from 10 A.M.  to 5 P.M. During that villagewide promotion, free parking is available on the top level of the municipal lot; at other times, parking is metered.

Clothing at 30 percent off can be one-of-a-kind hand-painted, quilted and appliqued women's vests designed by Valerie Guignon, usually $230; a cream-colored raw silk suit, otherwise $290; or fulllength coats of many colors and a mix of fabrics by Kate Wolf of California, each formerly $410 - antique Chinese buttons decorate one coat and small, white cowrie shells trim another.

There are a few crocheted, brimmed hats, earlier $40; there are adult-size textured vests from Colorado of hand-dyed and hand-woven wool and mohair by Arianthe and Kris Urbonas, originally $100; and there are wool, mohair and mixed-fiber hand-woven shawls by Mary Lynn O'Shea, once $175."
1983-05-08	NAME-DROPPING IS PART OF MENU	THE Country House in Stony Brook looks as if it has been transplanted from a Southampton summer colony. Several fireplaces and the exposed beams in a couple of areas suggest the origin of this attractive Colonial building turned restaurant. But most of it has been redecorated in shades of lime green and pink, with hanging plants, white trellises and tiny winking lights strung about. The menu currently in effect is called the Spring Collection from Palm Beach, another location that is in keeping with the decor. Some might consider the style of the Country House creative. The notion of adding garnish upon garnish, serving two sauces instead of one, complicating the seasonings and even designing the menu according to a particular theme can be successful. But at the Country House it often seems contrived.
1983-05-01	"DINING OUT;
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DELAWARE"	"AVISIT to Bucks County, Pa., in late spring can be downright addictive. Riding or cycling down country lanes and over covered bridges, it is hard to believe that such a sylvan setting is just 65 miles from Manhattan. The pleasantest way to savor the area is to stay at one of the little inns along the road skirting the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River.

A newcomer to the inn scene is Evermay on the Delaware, which occupies a spacious Victorian house and has been open less than a year. The owners, Ron Strouse and Fred Cresson, used to operate the nearby Sign of the Sorrel Horse."
1983-05-01	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Marking a New Line With Markdowns

Dakota Dry Goods opened in White Plains in August 1981 with outdoor and rugged clothing for men and women has just celebrated the grand opening of a department for footwear to match - all-weather, boating, hiking and walking shoes. There is a 20 percent markdown from suggested retail prices, including spring merchandise and footwear, and seasonal clearances on cold-weather clothing drop prices to 50 percent off or more on Boston Trader and Woolrich merchandise. Daily specials are marked on blackboards outside and within the shop.

Outerwear by Woolrich is at half price until gone - a down jacket formerly $168 is now $84 in a men's style and a similar women's down jacket with coyote-trimmed hood, formerly $190, sells for $49.90.  Woolrich down vests, earlier $60, are marked $29.90 as a clearance.  Slippers at $5.90 can be put away until the December holidays - the Muk Luks were $12.95 and the quilted or pile-lined Eski-Mox were $12. Ladies' thermal-insulated low boots by Specs, usually $29, are $12.90 in navy, dark green or burgundy."
1983-05-01	CONTINENTAL (THAT INCLUDES ASIA)	JACOB'S in Baldwin is a modest new Continental restaurant with an atmosphere that is warm and friendly enough to make it appealing despite a somewhat austere setting, and a menu that is diversified enough to make it interesting. Cooking is far from flawless, but efforts are made so that it has a certain originality. After its two and a half months of operation, a regular clientele seems to be developing - encouraged, it would seem, by the menu's moderate righthand column. The chefs worked at Quo Vadis in Manhattan for many years until that establishment's recent change of management. Their independent enterprise seats about 60 in a pair of small dining rooms. Rose-beige stucco walls are outlined with dark beams and random courses of brickwork, none of which is structural, and the rather stark effect is softened only slightly by some healthy hanging plants. Tables are nicely set.
1983-05-01	A SEAFOOD MOTIF IN SOUTH NORWALK	ANEW restaurant, Becket's Landing, has come to the corner of Washington and Water Streets in the revitalized area of South Norwalk. Not only does it look like the previous occupant of the premises, 50 Water Street, it is still using the former restaurant's matches and paper place mats. Exposed brick walls, hanging plants, New Orleans posters and tables close together evoke familiar memories. Even the menu contains echoes of times past, with an emphasis on oysters, seafood and a pronounced New Orleans theme. The seafood motif is natural: The back of the restaurant is on the Saugatuck River.
1983-04-24	"DINING OUT;
THE PERILS OF OWNING A RESTAURANT"	"THE Saddle River Inn occupies an old barnlike mill house that overlooks a pond on one side and, on the other, a charming courtyard ringed with small stores. The inside has been minimally decorated: Just one large flower painting, lace curtains and white cloths that make the tables stand out against the wood walls, floors and twostory-high ceiling. There are stairs leading to two dining balconies, and a long table near the entrance holds the bottles of wine brought by patrons.

Service ranges from pleasant and fairly efficient to surly and offhand. One evening, we were treated to a waiter whose indifference to our desires or even our well-being was obvious. He tapped his pencil against the pad while waiting for us to order, was abrupt to the point of being rude and told us that there were no roesti potatoes, even though they were being served at other tables. We had the feeling we were intruding on his privacy."
1983-04-24	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Outfits That Begin With Size 0

Just Petites by Tina at a White Plains retail shop are Tina Smokler styles for women 5 feet 4 and under who wear sizes 0 to 14. Miss Smokler, after years of designing petite proportions for major manufacturers, opened the first Just Petites retail shop in Nanuet five years ago, but now she designs and manufactures her own contemporary line in New City in Rockland County and sells her fashions at wholesale prices exclusively at her shops in New City, in Westchester and Ridgewood, N.J.

All alterations are free unless the prices are dramatically reduced at the end of the season - once altered there can be no returns.  Custom orders on a mix of a size 12 bodice and a size 14 skirt, or another combination, take a week and a half; personalized shopping and wardrobe planning are also available for working-at-home or dressed-for-the-office women.

The sale rack now has wool and other out-of-season dresses from major manufacturers at $39 that once were $107 and $110, with separates at half-price. All sales are final on clearance merchandise, but store credit can be allowed during mailing-list sales when no alterations are made."
1983-04-17	QUANTITY, QUALITY AT MODEST PRICES	EVERY now and then, when you think you cannot swallow another gummy stuffed clam, over-syruped duckling a l'orange or pudding mix masquerading as chocolate mousse, you chance upon a restaurant that makes dining out a welcome and worthwhile experience. Such was our luck at Maxfield's, a tiny one-room restaurant in Westbrook. Maxfield's exterior -weathered wood on a box-like building set close to the Boston Post Road - does not inspire visions of gracious dining. It would be all too easy to rush past to one of the bigger, flashier establishments down the road.
1983-04-17	SEAFOOD DONE SIMPLY AND NICELY	AMONG the restaurants that specialize in fish and seafood on the Island, relatively few of them do it well, which is why the Atrium in Seaford, a newcomer in this category, is such a welcome addition. The main dining room on the second floor of the restaurant's brandnew building is quite handsome, softly done in neutral beige, with some posters of flowers and a great many large potted plants. The atrium effect is achieved with a central skylight that overlooks the broad, brass-railed staircase leading from the lower level. There are large windows on three sides, but a romantic water view is out of the question. The windows overlook Sunrise Highway, providing a full view of several unattractive commercial signs, including a garish yellow one belonging to the restaurant itself.
1983-04-10	"DINING OUT;
WASHINGTON DID NOT SLEEP HERE"	"THE OLD MILL INN in Bernardsville is one of the few pre-Revolutionary War inns in New Jersey that does not claim that George Washington slept there. The reason, according to the legend on the menu, is that the building was not a hostelry then, but a granary.

The place did not become an inn until 1933, when William Childs transformed the interior into several dining rooms, plus seven bedrooms tucked under the eaves. Then, a few years ago, a modern motel-type building with sleeping quarters and conference rooms was added in a move designed to accommodate the area's growing corporate needs."
1983-04-10	PASTA AND SEAFOOD IN GREENWICH	A RESTAURANT named after the delightful seaside resort of Porto Fino in northern Italy promises to offer more than the ubiquitous tomato sauce that is the mainstay of so many Italian restaurants in Fairfield County. In that respect, Porto Fino in Greenwich does not disappoint. Its small menu runs the gamut of the map of Italy, with a few non Italian specialties as well. If one were to cite a culinary theme at Porto Fino, it would be pasta and seafood. Seven of the dozen entrees listed on the menu are pasta or seafood dishes, and each noon and evening there are several other pasta and/or seafood specials as well, both as appetizers and entrees.
1983-04-10	COMPETING WITH THE PAST	WESTBURY MANOR in Westbury, a stately establishment with magnificent grounds that was owned by the late Carl Hoppl, one of the Island's most famous restaurateurs, changed hands in the late 70's. It is again under new management and reopened earlier this year with the promise of having been restored to its former grandeur, as in the days of the legendary Mr. Hoppl. Never having visited Westbury Manor before, we cannot comment on how well this goal has been met. But it seems inconceivable that the reputation of Westbury Manor was built on having its patrons greeted by the Islander game blaring from a portable radio placed near the front door where the young ''valets'' waited to psrk cars. In the past, did waiters carelessly serve the food standing in one spot and handing plates across the table, directly in front of diners? Or did the captain, about to take the order, ask, ''What can I do you for?''
1983-04-03	"DINING OUT;
MUCH MORE THAN NORTHERN ITALIAN"	"A TRANSFORMATION has taken place on a corner in Old Pleasantville.  What was for years a sleazy spot specializing in cocktails or beer nuts metamorphosed two months ago into a tastefully decorated restaurant with a serious kitchen that serves well-cooked and exceptionally well-chosen fresh food.

James Parthemore 3d, the creative chef and co-owner, has put together a wieldy, unusual menu that not only showcases the chef's strengths and predelictions but also attempts to predict the preferences of the clientele. Even here the kitchen maintains its integrity, for Mr. Parthemore's ''surf and turf'' consists of splendidly grilled shrimp and snapper with tender filet mignon."
1983-04-03	NEW AND STYLISH IN WESTPORT	''WHERE do I park my horse?'' a friend asked, when we invited him to dine with us at Polo's, Westport's newest Post Road restaurant. Actually, the only horses at Polo's are on the walls in framed prints. The name hardly telegraphs the light, pleasingly sophisticated interior of what was once a fast-food restaurant. Cavernous space has been intelligently broken up into a number of softly lighted sections. A stylishly decorated waiting area with comfortable, gray couches near the bar gives way to white-washed, arched alcoves that hint of Mediterranean dining. There is an upper level of well-spaced tables. Fresh flowers on each table, two unusual fan-shaped, curtained windows and softly modulated jazz and classical music contribute to a sense of gracious dining. A dimly lighted rear dining room lacks the panache of the larger room.
1983-04-03	SPANISH DISHES, AND MEXICAN, TOO	AS at most Spanish restaurants, at La Paella, a small place that opened last year in Glen Cove, the portions are extremely generous and the prices relatively moderate. You will not leave hungry. The restaurant is hardly more than a storefront, decorated with heavily stuccoed walls and wrought iron to suggest a Spanish atmosphere. The tables are quite small and the captain's chairs arranged on either side of them are proportionately large, so the effect is one of crowding. But the atmosphere is pleasant, the service generally friendly and accommodating. And on weekends, when a flamenco guitarist is on hand to entertain, the music provides a festive note without intruding on conversation.
1983-03-27	"DINING OUT;
CHINESE DINING WITH A DIFFERENCE"	"BECAUSE Chinese restaurants have long been considered one of the best bargains around, patrons have accepted, without complaint, unpretentious, sometimes garish, surroundings and the type of service that discourages leisurely dining.

But for those who live within striking distance of the Ledgewood Mall in the Morris County community of Ledgewood, there is an alternative. A restaurant named Ho Ho, which opened there last Election Day, is as unlike the traditional mall restaurant as can be. 

It has a soft-gray carpet covering not only the floor, but also two of the walls. There are mirrors running the length of one wall, butcher-block tables, Breuer-style cane chairs, fresh flowers on the tables, cloth napkins and white-coated waiters."
1983-03-27	INDIAN SPICE AND FIRE	FOR years food trend starters have been predicting that the next foreign cuisine to be ''discovered'' by Americans en masse would be Indian. It hasn't happened yet, but if all Indian restaurants were up to the standards set by Mayur it might. Mayur, a five-month-old establishment in Fairfield, swells the ranks of Indian restaurants in Connecticut to, at last count, three. Somewhat difficult to find, on a side street just off the Post Road, Mayur (the name means peacock) is ensconced in a brick storefront building. Given its space limitations (50 seats), the restaurant evokes a sense of India, with a few banquettes covered with Indian fabric, Indian paintings and brass trays on the walls and the hypnotic background rhythms of Indian music.
1983-03-27	A DELICIOUS CHINESE SPECIALTY	THE star system does not always tell the whole story, and this review of Hunan River in Atlantic Beach serves as a case in point. The menu has been inspired by the culinary styles of several regions of China and is occasionally given a touch of distinctly contemporary Western originality. For the most part the preparation is decent, averaging out to one star. But at the same time, one specialty in particular is so outstanding, as good a dish as you are likely to find in any Chinese restaurant in the New York area, that a visit to Hunan River would be worthwhile just to sample it. It is listed on the menu as mussels in Hunan sauce, and unlike most of the other listings, instead of any hint as to its ingredients, it is explained merely as a Chinese-style favorite, with the added notation that it is spicy and being served for the first time on the Island. What arrives at the table is an aluminum chafing dish filled with steaming mussels in a beige broth. Bowls are provided, and mussels and broth are ladled into them.
1983-03-26	Your Money; Debt Insurance After Job Loss	SHERRY ROBERTS is a millworker at the Mayr Brothers sawmill in the economically depressed town of Raymond, Wash. Her husband, Ray, is a dairy farmer. When they began to plan the purchase of dining room and bedroom sets, they looked around them. They looked at Raymond, a lumber community that suffers a 22 percent unemployment rate, and at neighbors who had made large purchases only to find themselves laid off and hard pressed to make payments.
1983-03-25	Wine tasting and a Thai twosome.	WINE tasting has become so fashionable a pursuit that entire restaurants are being planned around it. The device that makes such tastings possible is the Cruvinet, a dispenser that keeps wine in good condition long after the bottle has been opened. Elizabeth's, the four-month-old restaurant on Lexington Avenue between 72d and 73d Streets, is the third place in town to have such a dispenser and, like Lavin's and Tastings, has a by-the-glass or half-glass wine list that encourages customers to try a variety of wines during the course of a meal. Owned by Michael Phillips, who formerly operated the First Avenue restaurant that bore his name, Elizabeth's has a long and handsome bar that leads to a back-room cafe with Cape Cod overtones. Unfortunately, tables are closely packed, and it is impossible to hold a private conversation. The food is new American in style, and though there is a fair number of very good dishes, there are too many remnants of the tearoom syndrome. Imagine, if you can, raw mushrooms sliced over unripe honeydew melon, dressed with oil, vinegar, cheese and a mixture of Provence herbs. The dressing is fine with the mushrooms, but disastrous with the melon. Or you might be offered chicken with raspberry vinegar, grapes and string beans, a combination we thought we'd pass up.
1983-03-22	Loan Rates Cut For Consumers	The Bank of New York cut its interest rates on consumer loans yesterday by from 1 to 3 1/2 percentage points. The new rates are effective tomorrow.
1983-03-22	MASTERCARD'S GOAL: SECURITY PLUS FLAIR	Nine months ago Mastercard International Inc. began looking for a credit card of increased security that would be cheap to make and easy for merchants and consumers to use. It had to be fast, involving minimum technology at the point of sale. And it had to have flair. ''We wanted something that was today,'' said Russell E. Hogg, the company's president and chief executive officer. ''Something that would make a sales clerk wake up and look closely.''
1983-03-20	"DINING OUT;
MEXICAN FOR LOCALS AND TRAVELERS"	"STYLE food has become one of the favorite casual foods of the East. The festive, fun food is popular with diners of all ages, from babies to their great-grandparents. The county's Cantina (there is a branch on Manhattan's Columbus Avenue) has been ''the restaurant in the park'' (Everett Macy County Park) for four years.  If informal ski lodge-style architecture and pretty dining rooms - the main one with a lovely fireplace, stone walls and high, arched wood ceiling - make it a particularly appealing stop for locals and travelers alike. In warm weather, tables and umbrellas spill onto terraces that overlook Woodlands Lake.

Considering the limited range of the cuisine offered in these parts, Cantina has a good variety of dishes, including vegetables, fish, chicken, beef and casseroles, although some are tamely seasoned. On every table, wonderful spicy hot chili-relish, meant to be the dipping sauce for taco chips, enlivened a number of bland or overly mild dishes. Stir a resuscitating spoonful into the guacamole dip (missing the flavor of fragrant fresh coriander). Other snacks or appetizers included savory nachos Cantinas, chopped sausage ringed with jalapenos and, less distinctive, chalupas, an imperceptible layer of refried beans covered with melted cheddar and a drizzle of guacamole, both served on crisp tortillas. Uninspired quesadillas combined soft tortillas with Munster cheese."
1983-03-20	RELIABILITY AND A TOUCH OF TRIESTE	PICCOLA ITALIA in Williston Park is small, comfortable and unpretentious, the type of place that's good to remember for a pleasant dinner if you're in the neighborhood. The menu holds no surprises and, for the most part, the preparation can be described as competent. Some delectable homemade desserts plus a list of wines that may be unique on the Island in its number of Yugoslavian selections are its distinctive features. Ample servings of steamed plump mussels or little neck clams in a rich, fragrant garlicky tomato sauce are admirable starters. The hot antipasto consisting of stuffed clams, stuffed mussels, stuffed mushrooms, a shrimp and some eggplant rollatini was marred by staletasting mussels (unlike the steamed ones) and a somewhat greasy quality to the eggplant, which had been fried prior to being stuffed and rolled.
1983-03-18	New American and old Provence style.	CONSIDERING how difficult it is to create a handsome restaurant and then serve good and interesting food, it's a pity to see those goals achieved only to be destroyed by inept service. But that is the story at the two-month old Jack's, the second-floor restaurant in the new luxury hotel called 1022 Lexington Avenue. Enter on the corner of 73d Street, and you come upon a slim, darkly attractive bar, where the trendy crowd is often jam packed and raucous, especially after 9 P.M. If you are lucky, your reservation will have been recorded for the right day; one night ours was not, and we had to go elsewhere. Climb the circular iron staircase, and you are in a long, narrow dining room, distinguished by silken black moire fabric on walls, contrasted to polished dark-wood molding and wainscotting. Unfortunately, tables are small and especially uncomfortable when three are seated at a table for two. And because the kitchen is downstairs, food often arrives tepid; it also arrives slowly (we once waited 45 minutes for appetizers). The staff is polite but inexperienced, and no one seems to be in charge. There are just enough good dishes to make eating in this urbane setting pleasant. The food is new American, with fresh, free-wheeling combinatons of ingredients. Creamy goat cheese adds pungency to a watercress salad, and it can also be good with eggplant and tomato, if used sparingly.
1983-03-13	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Extension Classes: A Springtime Array

The first 300 preregistered owners of woodlot property who attend the daylong forestry seminar at the Sheraton Plaza Inn in New Rochelle March 26 will receive a black walnut seedling. The 8:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. program will include sessions on improving a woodlot, harvesting, marketing and allied subjects. To register, each landowner must send $10 to the Secretary, Fernow Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. 14853. For any additional family member, the charge is $5.

1983-03-13	JAPANESE FOOD GRACIOUSLY SERVED	THE Japanese restaurants established in the last couple of years tend to follow a formula, and Yamato, in Plainview, is no exception. This small storefront restaurant, which has been in business for a couple of months, resembles many others of its genre. The dining room is brightly lighted and furnished with light wood tables and chairs, lighting fixtures designed to have the glow of oiled paper, and green plants. A sushi bar is at the far end of a long, narrow room, and an enclosed area is set aside for tatami seating on the floor. Not a great deal has been invested in decorations. The walls are adorned with posters advertising beer, and some of the wooden divider panels positioned throughout the dining room are particularly flimsy.
1983-03-13	A GENEROUS CHINESE NEWCOMER	NEW Chinese restaurants in southwestern Connecticut have often tended in recent years to seem like offshoots of one another, with similar dishes, even menus that look as though they were printed in the same place. Hunan Wok, a newcomer of two months on the Stamford scene, has its antecedents on Long Island. Yet its menu has many familiar dishes. What is different is that the preparation varies in certain of the dishes. While prices are similar to most other local Chinese restaurants, portions often seem half again as large. A single entree, if ordered with a soup or appetizer, can easily serve two. Two entrees are more than enough for three diners.
1983-03-11	PARIS OFFSPRING AND EAST MEETS WEST	WHEN a much-celebrated young Turk of France's nouvelle cuisine opens a restaurant in Greenwich, Conn., the event is noteworthy far beyond the boundaries of that community. Aware that the Paris restaurant run by the 29-year-old chef Guy Savoy rates a star in the Michelin Guide and 18 out of a possible 20 points in the Gault-Millau guide, food buffs want to know how well the chef's talents travel. Based on three dinners that I can compare with a delightful lunch enjoyed last year at the Paris original, I would have to say the answer is disappointing. There is some good food here, but too many dishes are contrived and tasteless, indicating that much of the chef's creative efforts here go into presentation rather than into developing flavor. Like the Paris restaurant, the Greenwich offspring is also called Restaurant Guy Savoy, and it is set in a small, unprepossessing house on Lewis Street, about an hour's drive from midtown Manhattan. Mr. Savoy visits once a month, rain or shine, to supervise the kitchen for a long weekend. Between those visits, the cooking is done by Yves Gonnachon, the former sous-chef in the restaurant on the Rue Duret in Paris. Certainly, the team has achieved consistency; the one dinner sampled when Mr. Savoy was in residence was identical to two tried when he was not.
1983-03-06	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Hair Replacement After Therapy or Illness

Adam & Eve hair and beauty centers serve both sexes as the name implies, but their expertise extends beyond and includes replacement needs stemming from natural or medical reasons such as disease or chemotherapy for people as young as 4 years old.

The salons have a mailing list for makeup, hair styling and blowdrying techniques, which are free and last about two hours, and each Tuesday through Thursday during March, a special combination of a facial, manicure and pedicure, ordinarily $68, costs $29.95 at the women-only shop at 770 Central Avenue in Scarsdale

Further south at 630 Central Avenue is a men-only hair-styling shop and the Adam & Eve headquarters for the moment for hair replacement and hairpiece styling using wig techniques developed by Allen Arthur of Minneapolis and called the Great American Option. The Allen Arthur booklet, ''Chemotherapy, Hair Loss ... and You'' is available at no charge."
1983-03-06	MASTERING THE MYSTERY OF FINE PRINT	''I T'S just a standard form,'' says the bank employee, handing you a loan or credit-card application or contract. Of course, you are going to sign. The interest rates are affordable. The repayment schedule is something you can live with. And because it is a standard form, all those pages of writing are probably just legal boilerplate, right? Not exactly. In a review of some of the standard credit applications and contracts used by five major banks in New York City, a consumer attorney found dozens of clauses that give the banks rights that most consumers would never imagine they were signing away. Now, as interest rates decline and consumers are likely to find more credit available, it makes all the more sense to read contracts carefully and to understand their provisions.
1983-03-06	ROTISSERIE FARE AT AN UNUSUAL SITE	DUE TORRI in Hauppauge is an unusual restaurant for the Island. It is on the fourth floor of an office building on Motor Parkway, and by day it commands a view mainly of the Long Island Expressway. One area of the large, elegantly appointed dining room is occupied by an open gas-fired rotisserie and a counter where a chef puts the finishing touches to many of the dishes. The rotisserie is a worthwhile feature because the spit-roasted meats are among the most appealing specialties of the restaurant and, with few exceptions, the only ones worth ordering. Many of the kitchen's creations - appetizers, salads and desserts as well as main courses - are poorly conceived, prepared and presented. The menu lists most of the dishes entirely in Italian, and the servers can be less than accurate when describing them.
1983-03-04	Bright American and faded German	AMERICAN regional cooking, so long neglected in fashionable culinary circles, is at last getting the attention it deserves. The latest and one of the most engaging examples of such cooking can be found at Carolina, a six-week-old restaurant on Restaurant Row -46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Even after so short a period, this restaurant, with its wood-burnished barbecued and grilled meats, grainy cornbread, custardy corn pudding, chili-fired souffles and sauces, and luxurious down-home desserts, is worth a visit for its own sake, even if you are not going to the theater. Carolina is owned by Martin Yerdon, who oversees the dining room, and Eileen Weinberg, a partner in the superb takeout-food shop Word of Mouth on Lexington Avenue. Miss Weinberg develops the recipes and trains the staff. So far, she has had more success with the kitchen crew than with the waiters. I was recognized here, but the experiences of colleagues not known to the management match my own; the staff is friendly and accommodating, but slow and in need of professional pacing. The prettiest part of Carolina is the back dining room, with its glass skylight. It is sunny by day, and at night, when candles are added, it becomes sparkling and urbane. A single palm tree is reflected in four mirrored walls, suggesting an infinity of palms, much like a breezy tropical jungle.
1983-03-02	Mastercard's New Design	Mastercard International Inc. plans to offer a credit card with three-dimensional qualities as a way to foil credit-card counterfeiters. On April 1 the 25,000 banks that issue Mastercards will start putting out new ones.
1983-03-02	JAIL STUDY PANEL URGES THE EASING OF RULES ON BAIL	A committee appointed to study jail overcrowding in New York City has suggested that the courts should make it easier for suspects to raise bail by allowing them to put down as little as 10 percent or pay by personal checks and credit cards. Those were among eight recommendations offered by the Committee on Jail Overcrowding, which was appointed by Mayor Koch and City Correction Commissioner Benjamin Ward. Dr. Gerald W. Lynch, the president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, was chairman. The city has already approved the recommendations that relate to bail, according to John F. Keenan, the City Criminal Justice Coordinator, and expects to put them into effect soon. A report issued by the committee estimated that 1,300 inmates could meet the eased bail requirements. Earlier this week, there were 10,492 people in the city jails. Under a Federal Court order, the Correction Department will have to begin releasing some inmates once the population tops 10,600.
1983-02-27	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Winter Clearance In Women's Fashions

Great Stuff first opened in Westport, Conn., two-and-a-half years ago with contemporary designer fashions in sizes 2 to 14, no juniors, and opened another shop a year ago on Garth Road in Scarsdale. The automatic discount is 20 percent and the current winter clearance drops prices by another 10 to 15 percent.

Regina Porter's striped raglan-sleeve velour top with round neck and two pockets, $55 elsewhere, is now $32; a hand-knit, high-neck Victorian gold sweater with leg o' mutton sleeves by South Wool, earlier $135 on Madison Avenue, is $80 and a Uraguayan multicolor geometric pattern on taupe virgin wool is a fitted handknit with wooden buttons by Lion Max, $200 elsewhere and $139.99 here, and down to $39.99 during the clearance.

Charcoal gray mohair is used by Fenn Wright Manson for a cowl-neck, short-waisted sweater, $80 elsewhere and now $55, and Gene Ewing for BIS designed a black wool flannel, trouser-front skirt with slit back, once $80 and now $52. A diagonally buttoned cowl-neck chemise, with Dolman-cut long sleeves and side-buttoned, is by Regina Kravitz in a bright pink plaid. It began at $140 and is now $85."
1983-02-27	HIGHLIGHTING THE REGIONS OF ITALY	THANKS to an ongoing series of special regional menus, Don Ciccio Il Pescatore restaurant in Freeport offers one of the more interesting and ambitious selections of Italian dishes on the Island. For those who seek some adventure and variety in Italian dining, this restaurant would be worth visiting. For a number of weeks Emilia-Romagna was featured. Now the spotlight has shifted to Liguria, the region that includes the Italian Riviera. Dishes on the regular menu are available in addition to the regional menus.
1983-02-27	DINING THAT IS NEARLY FLAWLESS	TAPESTRIES a well-named new restaurant in Greenwich - weaves the threads of stylish decor, a well-designed menu and artistically presented food into a gratifying dining experience. The handsome restaurant, in a redesigned old stone house, is equally appealing at lunch or dinner. At lunch, the natural light permits you to see with what mastery all the soft, purple colors are integrated: aubergine walls blend with the stair runners, the stunning dried flower arrangements in each of eight windows, the Denbrobian orchids on each table and the opalescence of the curtains and vases. Edwardian pictures complement the soft tapestry look of the banquette in the small, ground-floor dining area. At dinner the walls look brown, but the soft lights and piano music floating up to the main, intimate dining room on the second floor add graceful notes. Service at both times of day is superb - knowledgeable, helpful, anticipatory. Only on busy nights can there be prolonged waits between salad and entree.
1983-02-20	"DINING OUT;
OPEN KITCHEN: PLUSES AND MINUSES"	"LE BISTRO, an intimate little restaurant in the Delaware River hamlet of Stockton, was given two stars in 1978. It changed hands a couple of years ago, and the current chef, John Case, has kept to the same format, that of an appealing, eclectic menu of French, American and Italian dishes that he finishes in the open kitchen at the center of the dining room.

This serves two purposes: It makes the most of the limited space in a storefront-sized room, and it is interesting for the diners to watch Mr. Case whipping up their meals. The drawback is that it can get smoky and noisy with the clanging of pans in a room in which acoustics are not a prominent feature. (The quietest table is the one for four in a nook to the right of the kitchen.)"
1983-02-20	CAREFUL SHOPPER	"The Business Is Child's Play

A toy boutique called Child's Play opened in Scarsdale in September and has managed to avoid most products pushed on television, specializing instead in imported and child-proof products more traditional than trendy. Prices begin at 50 cents (small plastic people for a doll house) and go to $285 for a stuffed Steiff Rocking Bear. The layout of the shop is conducive to testing, with the lower shelving stocked with things smaller children like to push, cuddle or climb on.

For children addicted to playing ''con Brio,'' there is a town layout with the shaped wooden tracks, vehicles and buildings shaped by Brio, the Swedish manufacturer. Or a Motor Mat at $10 may suit a child with a hoard of Matchbox cars and no place to drive them - seven traffic signs and one barrier can be obtained for $9.95.  Larger, flexible Vikingplast cars come from Sweden and sell for $1; a truck is $7."
1983-02-20	FELICITOUS SETTIG IN A HOTEL	CHARDONNAYS in the Long Island Marriott Hotel in Uniondale could probably be the envy of many restaurateurs. Here is a new 120-seat restaurant in a new hotel built smack in the middle of the Nassau Coliseum parking lot. The restaurant is filled every night of the week, regardless of whether there is a hockey game. To a certain extent, Chardonnays can depend on a captive audience because many tables are reserved in advance by groups that use the hotel for meetings and business. It also deserves to be a magnet because it provides a particularly felicitous setting, with a dining room on two levels with comfortable velvet-covered chairs and banquettes and elaborately appointed lace-covered tables.
1983-02-13	"DINING OUT;
TRUFFLES WHERE A TREE USED TO BE"	"SEVERAL years ago, the tiny Morris County town of Meyersville was put on the map, so far as food people were concerned, when the Foy brothers opened the original Tarragon Tree restaurant. After the brothers moved on to open individual restaurants - John at Le Delice in Whippany and Denis at The Tarragan Tree in Chatham - there was a void that several restaurants tried unsuccessfully to fill.

Now, however, there is Truffles.  In the premises formerly occupied by The Tarragon Tree, Truffles is a little more elegant, and its service infinitely better, than the restaurants that preceded it. And although the food is not yet as good as either of the Foys is capable of producing, Truffles does have a unique style."
1983-02-06	"DINING OUT;
AUTHENTICITY IN INDIAN CUISINE"	"ALTHOUGH Curries n' Spice, the name of a new restaurant in Kingston, sounds rather like a cute Americanism for an Indian-style luncheon or dinner spot, this could not be further from the truth.  The owner-chef, Tehmina Alphonse, a native of Hyderabad, opened this appealing little restaurant after much urging from friends and students of her cooking school.

Set in a cozy, pre-Revolutionary stagecoach inn just outside Princeton, the two dining rooms are simply decorated with folkloric hangings, carvings and wooden elephants. Colorful arrangements of fresh flowers and exotic fruit and vegetables and linen-covered tables dress up the unpretentious rooms."
1983-02-06	WITH A DASH OF CREATIVITY	IL CASTELLO opened three months ago in a location that has previously housed at least three other restaurants. Because the last two tenants were Spanish, the decorations of the two small dining rooms were heavy with beams and wrought iron. The new owner, Gino Pena, formerly the maitre d'hotel at La Primavera in East Hills, has lightened the look of the place. The setting is now quite understated, with white stucco walls adorned by a few paintings, a series of arches to divide the space and mirrors to enlarge it. It is a comfortably formal atmosphere in which to dine.
1983-02-06	GOOD SPOTS FOR SUNDAY BRUNCH	DURING the dreary days of February, Sunday brunch can often be a cheering pick-me-up. And recently, a few Connecticut restaurants have come up with some brunch ideas a bit different from the familiar eggs Benedict. The following are brunches we commend to your attention. Sunday brunch in a museum surrounded by art works, with a picture window facing a patio, is a pleasing prospect. It is made especially so at Jonathan's, ensconced in two rooms of the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. That is because of the variety of the buffet, the ease of service, live piano music and the relaxed, Sunday-morning mood.
1983-01-30	"DINING OUT;
SERENE ITALIAN WITH A LIGHT TOUCH"	"CLASS has reached Port Chester's main shopping street, in Angsavanee, a plush, glowing, serene restaurant that serves excellent, light renditions of Italian cuisine. The Thai chef and owner, Charlie Touthong, has named the restaurant after his wife. The name means ''Shoulders of a Goddess.''

Deep, curved awnings and heavy white curtains shelter diners from the bustle of the street. Inside the softly lighted dining room - appropriately done in red, green and predominantly white - halfdividers and plants separate the rooms into cozy areas with generously spaced tables."
1983-01-30	ITALIAN FARE SERVED WITH FINESSE	ATTILIO'S is a comfortable storefront Italian restaurant in West Hempstead. The chef, who was born and raised in Italy, worked in several Italian restaurants on the Island before opening this place about three years ago. His cooking is straightforward, well-seasoned and presented with a good deal of finesse. His wife runs the dining room. Thanks to her and the other servers, who are extremely attentive and professional without any hint of pretension, the atmosphere at Attilio's is very appealing. That is despite rather gaudy decorations. A bright plaid carpet covers the floor, and the walls combine shiny wood panels, marbleized mirrors, metallic wallpaper and garish artwork. An oversized chandelier hangs in the center of the room. But the tables are properly set with white tablecloths.
1983-01-30	POPULAR FOR SUNDAY BRUCH	BACK during the Revolutionary War, an inn run by Jacob and Mary Bull was supposedly a gathering place for the Continental Army marching from their supply depot in Lebanon to Washington's headquarters in New York. In modern times, Bull's Bridge Inn has been established in the Kent area and is a popular gathering place both for an army of travelers along Route 7 and for local residents. An outsider, stopping for lunch, dinner or Sunday brunch, might be hard put to understand the inn's attractions. The restaurant, in a two-story, white clapboard, frame building, is unexceptional. Its main dining room is a pleasant if undistinguished pine-paneled room whose fieldstone window ledges are decorated with potted jade plants and hanging greenery.
1983-01-23	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Up to 50% Off on Shoes In Two Shops

At Heller's Shoes in Mount Kisco and Pleasantville, selected shoes and all boots are reduced 20 to 50 percent this month during the company's semiannual sale. It is a first-quality, full-service store. 

The 10,000 square-foot shop has a full range of traditional women's styles, including Revelations, Red Cross, Joyce, Selby, Naturalizer and Etienne Aigner and contemporary lines from Bandolino, Beene Bag, Andrew Geller and Nina. There are also salon fashions by Mr. Seymour, Evan Picone, Bally, Maserati and Amalfi and junior designs by Bass, Frye, 9 West, Dexter, Docksides, Zodiac, Adidas and Timberland."
1983-01-23	THE CHEFS' TRAINING IS EVIDENT	THOSE who have already discovered Nook and Cranny in Wantagh have been on the inside track for what is probably the best French food on the South Shore of Nassau County. This small restaurant close by the Wantagh station could be a neighborhood pub in any of a dozen towns and villages. The bar area is separated from the modest-sized dining room, which has both booth and table seating. The room is pleasant enough, with wood paneling, hanging plants and tablecloths. The menu is hardly typical, however. For the last two months the kitchen has been manned by two young graduates of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, and they prepare fairly classic French specialties such as filet mignon Bearnaise and steak au poivre along with more imaginative creations. The quality of their training is evident.
1983-01-23	PLEASANT FARE ON THE WATERFRONT	MEMORABLE waterfront dining in Connecticut is rarer than we would wish. So when you find a restaurant on the water that is both attractive and serves competent food, you feel a sense of triumph. That was our experience on several occasions recently at Steamboat Cafe, a glass-bright restaurant whose wide, dining-room windows curve partly toward Steamboat Wharf, partly toward the Mystic River.
1983-01-16	OLD-FASHIONED AND PLEASING FARE	SURFEITED with theme restaurants, boutique restaurants and other dining novelties, we found it refreshing to discover a simple, oldfashioned restaurant that is straightforward in its decor, uses fresh ingredients and prepares them (for the most part) with no-nonsense competence. Such a place is Ye Olde Tavern near the waterfront in New London. The interior features wall-to-wall framed pictures of old movie stars, local and state politicians, posters from World War I and II, vintage sheet music, old comic-strip panels and the stereotypical barroom painting of a reclining nude. Deer antlers hang over the brick fireplace in one cozy dining room off the pub-like bar.
1983-01-09	"NEW JERSEY DINING OUT;
NEW NAME CAN SPELL A DIFFERENCE"	"IN ITS second reincarnation in five years, Via Veneto - formerly La Forchetta d'Oro and, before that, Cassese's - has been operating under its present name and with a new Milanese chef, Franco Motti, for just over a month. Judging from the meals we sampled during several visits and a full house even during the holiday lull, Via Veneto should be here to stay.

Situated in an out-of-the-way corner of Orange in a distinctively non-posh neighborhood, the restaurant's valet parking and formal, if dated, decor come as something of a surprise. Mirrored walls, crystal chandeliers, faded damask draperies and Continental service are to be found inside an unpretentious frame building."
1983-01-09	SOME CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE	LE RESTAURANT in Glen Cove opened late last winter and was reviewed here in June, receiving a one-star rating. There are reasons for a second review. Restaurateurs often insist that it takes at least six months for a new establishment to be running smoothly. In the case of Le Restaurant, the owner did not suggest that the initial review was premature, but after it appeared he indicated that some changes had been made and that perhaps there should be a re-evaluation in the future. The future is now. There have been some changes for the better, mainly in the service of wine. The pretentious, overworked and somewhat inept sommelier is no longer on the premises, and captains have assumed the task of serving the wine. The expensive wine list is also more informative now. But the food has not improved. As a matter of fact, some of the dishes that had been disappointing months ago still cannot be recommended, and others, including most of the desserts, must be added to that list, making the likelihood of enjoying a satisfactory meal at Le Restaurant fairly remote.
1983-01-08	CREDIT CARD RATES STILL AT PEAK LEVEL	While rates on many consumer bank loans have started to slip, financing charges on most credit cards and revolving charge plans remain at their highest levels ever. Two years ago, the standard financing rate on most credit cards was 18 percent. Since then, annual charges on Mastercard and Visa accounts offered by most major banks have risen to 19.8 percent, and annual fees are up to $20, from $15. Sears, J.C. Penney and other national retail chains charge as much as 21 percent on their cards. Oil companies have added a processing charge of 2 percent to 3 percent on all credit purchases.
1983-01-02	"DINING OUT;
THREE VISITS ARE BETTER THAN ONE"	"ALTHOUGH some reviewers contend that one visit is all that is necessary to pass judgment on a restaurant, we have never found this to be the case. We have yet to discover a restaurant in any country that is consistent enough so that one visit mirrors the next (except for McDonald's). However, the first meal will usually decide whether a return visit is worthwhile.

Our first visit to Le Petit Chateau in Bernardsville not long after it opened was so unsatisfactory that we would have ignored it were it not for Joseph Gomez, its new owner. He was formerly headwaiter at La Petite Auberge in Creskill, and then performed the same function at the Grand Cafe in Morristown. (Not only do both those restaurants serve very good food, but they were also known for the excellence of their service under Mr. Gomez's eye.)"
1983-01-02	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Half-Price Sale At the Talbots

The Talbots, a retailer of classic and casual women's clothing in Hingham, Mass., moved to the new, Georgian-design Quaker Hill Center in Chappaqua in 1981. It took along its traditional post-New Year's Day half-price sale on winter merchandise, and this year. the sale will be on from Thursday until Jan. 15, except next Sunday. The hours are 9:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.

Nearby stores will also reduce prices on their merchandise on the same dates.  On some merchandise, the prices drop by 35 percent - and the shop will be less crowded - between Monday and Wednesday during a sale for customers on the catalogue list and holders of charge cards. At this time American Express, Diners Club, Visa, MasterCard and the Talbots charge or personal checks can be used. During the 50 percent sale, only cash or checks are accepted on the sale merchandise, and all are final sales."
1983-01-02	A CHINESE DISCOVERY IN MADISON	MADISON IF a reader hadn't alerted us, we might never have discovered Chan's Roadside In tucked into the rear corner of a small, inconspicuous shopping complex in Madison. For all its early-American brick exterior, Chan's Roadside In is a proper Chinese restaurant. A small, square dining room has a slightly separated alcove containing a few tables. The dining room is decorated with beige bamboo-designed wallpaper with a few traditional Chinese paintings, red plasticseated chairs and red candles on each plain table. The menu is authentically Chinese, dominated by Sichuan and Hunan dishes. The menu is surprisingly large considering the size of the establishment. Almost 100 dishes are listed. When Chan's is up to standard, it can be very good indeed. The recurring problem is lack of consistency. At the same meal, dishes ordered hot and spicy vary from totally bland to, yes, hot and spicy. Dishes not listed as hot turn out to be so.
1983-01-02	CHINESE WITH A MANHATTAN TOUCH	HUNAN PAVILION opened in Great Neck a few months ago, one of several new Chinese restaurants on the Island announcing that some of the management and staff members were previously connected with the more elegant uptown Chinese restaurants in Manhattan. The food at Hunan Pavilion is astonishingly good on occasion, suggesting that the Manhattan connection has been effective. Unfortunately, there are disappointments as well. In terms of atmosphere, Hunan Pavilion has a great deal to learn from quality restaurants. Aside from the suspending of several Chinese lanterns from the ceiling, it appears that the mishmash of decoration left from the previous tenant, an Italian steak house, has remained untouched. And it shows wear, unattractively in places. The dark brown shag carpeting, for example, an inappropriate choice in any restaurant, never looks clean enough. The doors leading to the kitchen appear stained, and the entrance doors to the restaurant from the vestibule are cheaply built.
1982-12-31	A new entry in nouvelle cuisine.	ADOUBLE helping of deja vu is the specialty at Pierre Francois, the insistently nouvelle-cuisine restaurant that opened two-and-ahalf months ago on 58th Street, between First Avenue and Sutton Place. The first where-have-I-seen-this-before feeling comes at the door, with the realization that this is the former home of the nowextinct Dodin-Bouffant restaurant. True, diners are now greeted by a doorman-checkroom attendant comically costumed as a gendarme, a touch that might have come right out of a Jacques Tati farce. But that is hardly enough to overcome the pretentious service and the soporific effect of the small, understated upstairs dining room with its dull pink walls and gloomy lighting. In addition, tables are positioned so that they are uncomfortable for parties larger than two, and two particularly awkward tables are smack up against each other and a hot baseboard radiator. Those who have faithfully tracked the nouvelle-cuisine circuit for the last few years should recognize the food. For Jean-Pierre Lauret, a chef and a partner, was one of the first chefs at Le Plaisir. He continues to exhibit many of the same strengths and flaws that marked his earlier performances.
1982-12-26	"DINING OUT;
A TOUCH OF THE ORIENT IN MADISON"	"IN A suave and simple modern setting just off Madison's Main Street, Darwin and Yen Chang operate an appealing new Chinese restaurant. What had started as a take-out place was expanded a couple of months ago into two pleasant dining rooms seating a total of 75 people.

The chrome and cane chairs, plush carpeting, linen napery and soft lighting, at Four Seas are a far cry from the standard superwattage, red-and-gold plastic decor of the typical suburban Chinese restaurant. Except for a few sub-compact tables for two, the larger tables here are comfortably spaced. A revolving lazy Susan on a table for six is a boon for those who dip into the communal serving dishes, as the Chinese do."
1982-12-26	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Some Sweet Music On Pianos and Organs

The fifth yearly inventory clearance at Jack Kahn Pianos and Organs in White Plains cuts list prices on selected merchandise from today through Friday. Red dots on instruments indicate a 50 percent reduction, green-dotted items are reduced 40 percent, the yellow, 30 percent, and the blue, 20 percent, all first-come, first-served. All items are tagged.

Despite the price cuts, the 53-old ownership maintains its usual policies: free delivery in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut; Music Horizons introductory lessons for every member of the family household; a free bench and a replacement waranty - 10 years on any piano and two to five years on any organ.

Another company policy is intended to prove its prices are lowest - within 30 days after delivery, Jack Kahn will give back the difference plus 10 percent on any authorized dealer price lower than that paid for an identical purchase. And within one year any Jack Kahn item can be exchanged with the full price paid applied to any other instrument at the regular tag price, with no redelivery charge. There is one free tuning before delivery and one after, sometimes two, depending on the brand purchased."
1982-12-26	COZY AND COMMENDABLE	BY the end of the year, the options for dining out in eastern Suffolk diminish as restaurants are shuttered until spring, but a bright oasis of cozy atmosphere and commendable food that closes only for the month of February is the Patio in Westhampton Beach. It is under the same management and boasts the same executive chef as the excellent Inn at Quogue. For some reason, the same high level of preparation is not maintained as consistently at the Patio, and the sheer delights are fewer. But the kitchen generally does a fine job.
1982-12-26	NEW SPOTS FOR GOURMET TAKE-OUT	'TIS the season to be jolly -and if you are in the take-out food business, to be busy as well. Never before have state residents had such a wide range of freshly prepared foods ready to be taken home as are available now. The ''gentrification'' of take-out food shops - featuring gourmet fare above and beyond delicatessen items - began a year or so ago, but in 1982 it accelerated considerably. Some of these shops have evolved from and are offshoots of culinary supply stores. Most of the food shops feature a line of gourmet staples as well, such as raspberry vinegar, unusual oils and herbed mustards. The following shops are new to the gourmet take-out food scene this year.
1982-12-19	IN AN ITALIAN-CONTINENTAL STYLE	AQUA MANOR is an outpost of northern Italian dining situated near the water in Manorhaven, an area of marinas and yacht clubs. It has been under new management for the last two months. The change has not altered the comfortably pleasant, dark wood panel look of the place, but the garish pink and white fluorescent lights that draw the eye to the undulating ceiling in the second dining room could have been eliminated without regret. The menu is shiny and new with listings that are mostly old hat - the standard specialties that one has come to expect in northern Italian-Continental establishments, interchangeable with dozens of other restaurants. It is augmented by several special offerings each evening that are worth noting. The preparation is competent and, while capable of authoritative seasoning, it can also be careless. Better coordination between kitchen and dining room might result in fewer dishes being served barely tepid.
1982-12-16	ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AFTER THE WARRANTY	IN this age of the electric appliance, it is always a shock to find that the bagel warmer doesn't get hot, the vacuum cleaner has lost its suction or the blow dryer simply won't work. Most new appliances are covered by a warranty that usually states that the manufacturer will be responsible for defects and repairs over a specified time (usually 90 days to six months on small appliances and up to five years on some parts in appliances such as sewing machines and vacuum cleaners). Warranty service generally requires no fee except for postage when the appliance must be mailed for repairs. When the warranty expires, consumers must pay all charges.
1982-12-12	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Inexpensive Gifts From the Museum

Schoolchildren visiting the Hudson River Museum swarm about its gift shop in groups of 10 to select their souvenirs or stocking stuffers, often under $1 each: for 15 cents, a two-inch plastic paper clip; for 25 cents, an animal sticker, a curlicued woodshaving Christmas-tree decoration, a minibag for party favors or a metal butterfly pin; for 45 cents, a pencil with multicolor lead; for 50 cents, a liquid crystal sticker of a spaceship, an alligator or a monster, or a larger party-favor bag; for 75 cents, a small plastic elephant and two balls that can each be lofted above the trunk by blowing softly, and for 85 cents, there are two tiny flocked bears in a hand-woven bamboo basket.

Ellie Conason, a former preschool and first-grade teacher known for well-selected crafts at her own gift shop in White Plains for 28 years, stocks the shelves with both the children's items from around the world and adult wares, sometimes tied to exhibits. The Silhouettes of Style, fashions from 1870 to 1929, prompted display cases of period sterling silver reproductions by Ed Levin from a Victorian press arranged on old lace. Another exhibit case holds handpainted articulated-wood characters from Alice in Wonderland and Winnie-the-Pooh, which can be sold only after the holidays as sets."
1982-12-12	"DINING OUT;
THE LURE OF NEWARK'S IRONBOUND"	"THE Ironbound section of Newark is a mecca for admirers of the ample, moderately priced fare and easygoing atmosphere of its Spanish cum Portuguese restaurants. Tucked in a corner there, amidst the neat row houses, is Tony DaCaneca, a neighborhood restaurant and tavern that has been dispensing satisfying mariscada, shrimp al ajilo and the like for almost 12 years.

Behind a modest facade are the comfortable dining room and a separate bar. White-clothed tables and fresh flowers dress up the unpretentious rooms, and the genial, efficient Portuguese waiters know the ropes very well. Service is flawed only by occasional forgetfulness."
1982-12-12	MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS	WHEN La Veranda opened in Glen Cove a little more than two years ago, it quickly acquired a well-deserved reputation as one of the better restaurants in the area. It is now a pleasure to report that the high standards of service and consistently fine preparation observed in the early months of La Veranda's operation have been maintained. If the overall impression is somewhat shy of three stars, the potential for such a rating certainly exists. The tables are comfortably spaced in a dining room of extremely limited size. The walls and ceiling are upholstered in plush iceblue and beige velvet, suggesting a jewel-box interior. One wall is mirrored and would serve to expand the area visually except that the room is underilluminated, making reflections in the mirror scarcely visible. For comfortable dining, La Veranda should increase the lighting level somewhat, either by using candles or other table lamps or greater wattage in the wall sconces.
1982-12-05	EXPLORING OHIO, LONDON THEATER, SAVANNAH; Mother's Day On Wheels	If you're a bicyclist and want to join a tour that is practically a cult event among cyclists, it may not be too early to start thinking about Mother's Day. That's the weekend (May 7-8) on which Ohio's annual Scioto River Valley Tour takes place and the registration quotas fill up far in advance. The 210-mile cycling tour extends from Columbus to Portsmouth, Ohio, through the Scioto River Valley on the Kentucky River. The route follows county roads and state highways, weaving through gently rolling hills and farmland, offering a panorama of lilacs, dogwood, azaleas and wildflowers. Along the way, cardinals, hawks and orioles can be seen - with even an occasional vulture wheeling overhead.
1982-12-05	CONTINENTAL FARE, WITH CHANGES	WHEN Frederick's first opened in Melville a little over three years ago, it offered Continental food that was often better than average and served in a comfortable, attractive, contemporary setting. While success may not have spoiled Frederick's, it does not seem to have improved it, either. The capacity of the place looks about double now, with tables crammed close to one another in the main dining room as well as the bar area. And when they are filled, which is frequently the case, the noise level in both rooms detracts from the pleasure of dining. The main dining room is also dimly lighted so that the combined effect of noise, crowding and darkness make it resemble a supper club with the show about to begin, rather than a serious restaurant. Only upstairs, where another small dining area has been opened, is there more light and serenity.
1982-12-05	ATTRACTIVE OLD MILL WITH A VIEW	YALESVILLE DINING out in an old red-brick factory might not sound like the most enticing culinary experience. But the Britannia Spoon Company, a restaurant with the same ownership as the New Haven, in the city of the same name, has turned an old mill on the Quinnipiac River into an inviting dining locale. The building itself is an attraction. Cavernous space has been broken into two dining rooms and a large, separate bar, which seems to be a popular gathering place for singles. The larger dining room has plants and pottery, copies of old pressed-wood chairs and Tiffany-type suspended lamps or green-shaded oil lamp replicas hung over each table. In the smaller, cozier room, old britannia spoons are hung in artfully arranged groupings on the walls. In both rooms, tables facing the river give choice views of a waterfall.
1982-12-03	French cuisine in theater district.	CONSIDERING the demand for good, pleasant, moderate-price restaurants in the theater district, La Vieille Auberge should develop a loyal following. Opened just six months ago on Restaurant Row - 46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues - the simple, comfortable bistro is a family affair. The owner and overseer of the dining room is Marcel Riou, formerly a waiter at the ''21'' Club. He is aided by his wife, Marie Louise, and on weekends, their son pitches in as a waiter. The chef, Jean Le Cras, cooked at Restaurant Raphael when it first opened, and he is adding stylish nouvelle cuisine touches to the sort of menu that has become standard at French restaurants on this block. His efforts are more successful with some dishes than with others, although he provides enough very good food to make up several fine dinners. The qualities that seem to elude him are lightness and delicacy. Those failings are most obvious in a nouvelle cuisine dish such as the terrine of vegetables, here a creation of oversize proportions and overcooked vegetables. And the addition of spinach is a mistake because it invariably leaks.
1982-11-28	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Seventh Avenue Furs Come to Ossining

The Fur Source, a three-year-old limousine shopping service to Manhattan for purchases that are nearly wholesale price, is turning the tables by bringing Seventh Avenue furs to Gilbert Vincents at the Arcadian Shopping Center in Ossining Friday through Sunday.

Prices will be 40 to 80 percent off retail and the million-dollar shipment will include coats, capes and jackets in classic and sport styles, plus one-of-a-kind designer samples. Natural ranch and natural Canadian wild mink, natural Canadian fisher and natural sable, natural red fox or blush-dyed blue fox, brightener-added raccoon, natural fitch, natural tanuki, natural beaver and natural longhair beaver are included. The original labels will be left."
1982-11-28	NEW CHINESE PLACE AT A MALL	DAVID'S CHINA GARDEN in Massapequa opened a few months ago at the edge of the Sunrise Mall. But don't wait for a shopping trip before dining at David's. This is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area. The dining room is fairly small, done in neutral beiges and brown with hanging plants for a light, airy feeling. The one drawback to the design is that the round tables for four are quite small and do not allow enough room for several platters of food. Although the waiters will serve the food at tableside, putting some of each dish on each plate, this means that sauces may run together and flavors will merge. Unless you are particularly pressed for time, it pays to request that each entree dish be served separately, in succession, and thus be appreciated individually without making demands on the limited tabletop area.
1982-11-28	FRENCH CUISINE IN STAMFORD	STAMFORD THERE'S a newcomer in Stamford - Le Parisien, a French restaurant ensconced on Hope Street in a building formerly occupied by an Italian restaurant. If you enter from the rear parking lot, you'll pass a long, dark bar before reaching the lighter dining rooms that are separated by open arches. The cream-colored walls have been decorated with lighthearted Paris scenes painted on the stucco. Acoustics could be improved: the sound level is shrill at times. Though the configuration is the same, the food at Le Parisien is far superior to its predecessor. The level of competence in the kitchen exceeds that shown in the dining room, where service borders on the pretentious, but can be careless and disorganized, too. Courses are served, but implements to eat them with are sometimes overlooked. Waiters reach across one diner to serve another frequently.
1982-11-26	A taste of India on the East Side.	MANY of the city's neighborhoods are being enriched with modest storefront Indian restaurants that provide engaging food at moderate prices. One newcomer is Tanjore, an informal, brightly attractive restaurant on First Avenue, between 66th and 67th Streets. Opened just four months ago, it is owned and managed by Ashok Seth, who has managed the Persian restaurant Tavoos, the Bombay Palace, Gaylord's and Sahib. There is only a small staff at Tanjore, and service is slow when more than six tables are occupied or when a large party orders a great many dishes. Nevertheless, staff and management are polite and friendly, and they do their best.
1982-11-21	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"A Timed Sequence Of Price Lowering

Quality nationally advertised home and office furnishings at competitive prices have been offered at J. H. Harvey for 27 years in White Plains, in Peekskill - where there is also an Ethan Allen Gallery - and in Stamford, Conn. Also, it operates Put-Together Shops; there is one at the opposite end of the Loehmann's Plaza location in White Plains and another is across from Lord & Taylor in Stamford.

Now, the warehouse clearance center at the lower level of the White Plains Put-Together Shop has been expanded, renamed the Furniture Clearance Center and a timed sequence of price lowering has been instituted. The Sept. 25 floor samples, for instance, arrived at onethird off the J. H. Harvey retail price, dropped by a further 10 percent Oct. 25; on Friday morning will lose another 15 percent and by 90 days reach the final price. They are then removed from the floor and disposed of by other means."
1982-11-21	A CHINESE SURPRISE IN NEW CANAAN	NEW CANAAN SOMETHING new has been added to the New Canaan restaurant scene - Mr. Lee. Named after its ''angel,'' the condominium developer Johnson Lee, it is a welcome addition, the first professional Chinese restaurant in town. Mr. Lee has adroitly turned a former clothing store interior into a softly lighted, handsome restaurant. Tables are well spaced and the look is one of contemporary simplicity, with Breuer chairs and quality reproductions of famous Chinese paintings forming a gallery setting along the walls.
1982-11-21	ALL-PURPOSE MENU FOR ALL PALATES	REMSEN'S GARDEN RESTAURANT in Greenvale tries to offer something for everyone. One element that seems to be missing from this new, large and elaborately decorated multilevel installation in the Wheatley Plaza shopping center is the actual garden. Instead, there are abundant plants, brass railings, ceilings that are either tented in fabric or coffered in plastic, discreet neon signs, lampposts and touches of Art Nouveau. The dining room is bathed in a rosy glow. The menu is one of those appealing, all-purpose affairs, offering every possibility from a bowl of onion soup, a sandwich or an omelet to pasta, seafood, steaks and desserts, plus an array of coffees laced with liqueurs and cocktails whipped to a froth with ice cream. And, with the exception of the larger entrees that are served only after 5 P.M., all these items are available at all times. The wine list is conveniently printed on one of the menu folds so the hassle of obtaining the list is avoided. But they forgot to indicate vintages.
1982-11-14	"DINING OUT;
NOW, IF YOU'RE FOND OF FONDU ..."	"MUCKING about in a pot of molten cheese fondue with cubes of bread speared on long-handled forks is one of life's simple pleasures, one that's fun to revive now and then. An excellent version can be found at Auberge Swiss, where the fondue is an authentic concoction of bubbling Gruyere, white wine and kirsch, and can be accompanied by a chilled bottle of Fendant or Ermitage, the fruity white Swiss wines.

Opened just four months ago, the restaurant is on the site of the defunct Pine Tree Inn in Berkeley Heights, near Summit. The brown and white decor is Swiss Spartan, particularly in the bar; however, in the evening, when the dining room is filled with people and candlelight is reflected in the brass service plates, the ambience is quite pleasant. Nice touches are Windsor-style chairs and seasonal posies on each table."
1982-11-14	"DINING OUT;
WHERE TO DINE ON THANKSGIVING"	"HERE in the Northeast where it all began, Thanksgiving is that special moment between the falling of the last leaf and the falling of the first snow. It is an American holiday - a patriotic one whose magnitude is shared only with the Fourth of July. But while celebration of the Fourth demands picnics and cookouts, Thanksgiving takes its festivities indoors, foregoing the American hot dog in favor of the American turkey.

The occasion requires us to reaffirm the ties that bind with family and friends at one pilgrim home or another. Some, however, declaring a holiday from cooking, will choose to gather at a table away from home. For them, we list a few of the restaurants in the area that will serve the traditional bird and all the usual, and sometimes not so usual, trimmings, in an atmosphere appropriate to the celebration of this day.

In every case, reservations are necessary, and early ones advised.  Half-portions for young children are often available. Prices do not include tip, tax, wine or other drinks."
1982-11-14	A COMPOSITION OF ETHNIC TREATS	WESTPORT BEETHOVEN is playing to full houses every day on the Post Road in Westport. A restaurant with this auspicious name is ensconced in a dramatic new, contemporary building of rounded and vertical forms. Inside, the setting is an inviting one with numerous small dining areas on upper and lower levels, high ceilings, several glassed-in, greenhouse porches, fine wood detailing and finishing, brass railings, excellent lighting and carefully planned interior decor. Classical music rises to a crescendo at the entrance, but is modulated in the dining areas.
1982-11-12	Tastes of Vietnam and a bustling pub.	UNTIL recently, the intricate and savory specialties of Vietnam have been only meagerly and indifferently represented in New York. Now the void has been filled most capably and deliciously by the Dao family, which owns and operates Saigon, a tidy little downstairs restaurant on Mulberry Street in Chinatown. The family, Chinese in origin, lived in Vietman for four generations, came to this country four years ago and opened this restaurant last April. Vietnamese food has been described as halfway between the cuisines of Thailand and China, but that description hardly prepares a diner for the subtle intricacies and seasonings that make this food so beguiling. From the Thai kitchen come such seasonings as lemon grass, fish sauce, coriander, curry, hot chili peppers, scallions and mint. And resembling Chinese dishes are all of the stir-fry combinations, the hoisin and soy sauces and an array of fried and steamed dumplings.
1982-11-07	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"About Everything For the Office

A one-month-only sale at Euster Associates in Armonk just about does the basic furnishings - elegantly modern - whether for an executive office away or at home. List prices are cut from a total of $5,632 to $3,743 on the entire package, or to between 30 and 42 percent on these individual items: a desk and credenza by Xception of Canada; a Charles Eames chair and ottoman made by Herman Miller in Zeeland, Mich.; a Tizio desk lamp from Italy; a metal-framed Radius Two desk set made in Buffalo; and the Westnofa Balans Variable chair from Norway.

The sale begins Nov. 15 and ends Dec. 13 at Euster Associates contract division, which specializes in contemporary office designs at wholesale prices of up to 40 percent off list. is open every weekday during business hours upstairs at the Modern Furniture Barn.  The 40-year-old parent business began in Manhattan and moved to a barn in the county in 1955 - at one stage the repainting of that earlier building to help it be more visible among the red barns led to its other name, The Yellow Barn."
1982-11-07	SOPHISTICATED FOOD IN CAFE SETTING	RIDGEFIELD AT first glance, the Food Chandler looks like yet another gourmet takeout shop. Refrigerated glass-fronted cases filled with tempting homemade salads greet you as you enter. In the store's center are jars of special mustards, jams, vinegars, other condiments and culinary temptations. Then, if you wend your way around the labyrinth of display cases you will see two modest groupings of tables, one arranged around the front window and the second in the rear. Blue-andwhite checked tablecloths, fresh flowers in tiny bottles on each table and ice cream parlor-type chairs add to the bistro look. If this all sounds deja vu, wait just a minute. The unusual, small menu will first pique your interest. And when the food is served, you will know for sure that the unpretentious Food Chandler is no runof-the-mill, quaint little eatery, but a place with an imaginative and knowledgeable approach to food. The owner, Charles Bertrand, and his chef, Ruth Stroup, seem willing to take a few culinary risks that do work - exceedingly well.
1982-10-31	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"A Cornucopia Of Bargains

An Election Day sale at Country Wares in Chappaqua means 20 percent off on giftware and gadgets, table linens and baskets, stemware and gourmet foods - everything, in fact, except the coffee beans and the Tommer cutlery made in Minneapolis. Other sale times are Friday and Saturday on Thanksgiving weekend and pre-Christmas specials with individual items beyond 20 percent off.

The Slip-let Vaffeljern by Eva is, in translation from the Danish, a non-stick coating waffle-iron that can be used over gas or electric burners and over wood stoves or campfires. It makes five individual heartshaped waffles and sells for $37.50. Clear glass individual fish plates by Jeanette, both ovenproof and Microwave-proof, are $1.79 each. The same firm makes the Chef's Choice series of covered casseroles and bakers that are also in stock."
1982-10-31	Food	There is a new sophistication to foods that can be ordered for holiday gift-giving. From Champagne-filled truffles to red-pepper wreaths, a world of alluring culinary gifts is only a letter or phone call away. Not so long ago, when one wanted to send a gift of food for Christmas and wasn't about to do the actual cooking, the choices were just about limited to fruitcake, frozen steaks or perhaps a fruit or cheese of the month. Today, the choices seem delectably overwhelming, so much so that it is difficult to sort out those foods that merely look good from those that also taste good, at least without sampling each and every one. But mail-order companies do offer a wonderful opportunity to share the incredible array of top-quality foods that are not readily available in many areas of the country. Who besides the residents of a few large cities can call up local shops to order fresh foie gras, baby artichokes, Champagne-filled truffles and golden caviar? Mailorder foods open up a wide world of culinary treasures - from the wonderful regional foods of this nation to the exotic imports from afar.
1982-10-31	GOOD VALUE, ESPECIALLY THURSDAYS	NEW MILFORD THE restaurant at 31 Bank Street, which takes its name from its address, is in a building that formerly housed a funeral parlor and a furniture store. In its current metamorphosis, the orange-red brick turn-of-century building has been impeccably restored. Inside, the fine brick walls have been preserved. Otherwise, the restaurant is an understated mix of white walls with gray wood trim, color-coordinated cafe curtains along the storefront windows and Swedish ivy hanging from the high ceiling.
1982-10-24	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Ones-of-a-Kind At Dobbs Ferry

Estherwood's Elegant Boutiques is an yearly event set in Victorian splendor at The Masters School in Dobbs Ferry as a fund-raising event beginning at 10 A.M. Nov. 10 (until 5 P.M.), Nov. 11 (until 8 P.M.) and Nov. 12 (until 3 P.M.).

Each of these days, coffee is served from 10 to 11:30 A.M.; luncheon is from noon to 2 P.M., for $6, and other refreshments are available from 3 P.M. on - and there are door prizes. Adult admission is $3 a day or $5 for all three, with all tickets sold at the door.  Although children are welcome - at a cost of $1.50 each under age 10 - strollers cannot be accommodated."
1982-10-24	AN INVITING STOP FOR THE WAYFARER	NEWTOWN THERE'S something especially inviting about stopping for dinner at a country inn after an afternoon of foliage viewing. That was our goal recently as we drove through the hills and valleys around Bethel and Danbury. Presto, there it was, an inn unknown to us - Hawley Manor Inn. The outside conformed to preconceived standards: a rambling, gray clapboard house with white trim. Inside, there is a small dining area leading into a larger dining room with a gas-log, white brick fireplace in the center of one long wall. Wood paneling, white stucco and beamed ceiling and fresh flowers on each table were all welcoming touches. Not a fancy room, but comfortable.
1982-10-24	BROILED FARE WITH LITTLE FUSS	SEVERAL months ago, Ma Chaumiere opened in a bright, trim little house a short distance from the center of Smithtown. It makes a sincere effort to prepare and serve a varied selection of provincial and classic French dishes, but the results are generally short of satisfactory. Too many of the dishes are flawed, and the staff and kitchen seem inadequate even for the limited capacity of the two small dining rooms. When the restaurant is nearly filled, as on most weekends, the dinner proceeds at a snail's pace. Even the menus are in short supply at busy times.
1982-10-22	India and Italy On the West Side.	IN the six years since Shah Jahan opened on Eighth Avenue, between 57th and 58th Streets, it has drawn a loyal following from neighborhood offices, Coliseum visitors, television personalities at nearby CBS studios and young dancers and show business hopefuls who appreciate the interesting food and moderate prices. Vegetarians find many tempting dishes at Shah Jahan, such as spiced eggplant puree (bhurta), curried cauliflower and potatoes (alu gobhi) and homemade cheese with peas (mattar pannir). All are served on the vegetable thali, a tray of small dishes, each holding a different preparation. Rice with vegetables (vegetable birani), a cooling cucumber and yogurt sauce (raita), curried vegetables (jalfrezi) and velvety stewed lentils (dahl) are also on the tray, along with chutneys and papadam, a crisp, peppery wafer - a lusty, satisfying assortment for $10.95. In a folkloric setting that could use better lighting and cleaner tablecloths, Shah Jahan offers interesting dishes to meat eaters as well as to vegetarians. If more attention were paid to frying and to the temperature of the food, the restaurant would merit a two-star rating.
1982-10-17	"DINING OUT;
FRESH ITALIAN, FRESHLY MADE"	"IN Scotts Corners's attractive Colonial-style block of shops, Di Nardo's, a well-established neighborhood restaurant, turns out a competent pizza in the front room and serves more serious and expensive Italian cuisine in the rear dining areas. The items listed on the a la carte menu had a familiar ring. But, in fact, some of the dishes, far from familiar, were surprisingly contrived. Nevertheless, the food seemed to be fresh and freshly made. Choosing with care, diners could be assured of satisfying, well-cooked meals here if, in general, they avoid the tomato sauces - overcooked and blunt in flavor - and stick to simple preparations.

Lavished with garlic and butter melted down to the crust, garlic bread helped suppress hunger during the wait for appetizers. The delicious precaution proved unnecessary when the order of hot antipasto arrived, a proverbial ''meal in itself.'' Two could easily have shared this platter of shrimp, little necks sprinkled with herbed crumbs, stuffed mushroom caps and green pepper halves, eggplant rollatine filled with ricotta mixed with bechamel, the whole showered with a dozen hot bits of deep-fried mozzarella. Billed as a specialty, mozzarella in carrozza, a bland, deep-fried cheese and bread ''sandwich'' might have been livelier had we chosen the anchovy sauce rather than the pale marinara offered. An overly astringent salad dressing needed only a few extra dashes of oil for balance."
1982-10-17	AN ITALIAN MENU WITH A DIFFERENCE	RIVA has been open for about a year in an upstairs location in Great Neck that previously housed two other restaurants for briefer tenancies. But Riva deserves a long run because it is certainly one of the better Italian restaurants in the area. The menu offers a broad selection of appetizers, pasta dishes, main dishes, salads and even cheeses, a varied and appealing compendium derived from many regions of Italy. Along with fairly commonplace dishes, there are several that are listed infrequently on the typical Italian menu. The food is consistently well prepared, refined but honest, and attractively presented.
1982-10-17	GOOD-VALUE CHINESE IN NORWALK	NORWALK A new Chinese restaurant has opened in Fairfield County and it is notable on two counts: It offers fine value for the money and it has resisted the trend to use Hunan or Sichuan in its title. Wok, located on the Norwalk-Westport line, is in fact an offshoot of Szechuan in Westport. The same management also runs Szechuan Park South in New York City. The new restaurant is marked by spaciousness: A large, softly lighted dining room is on the ground floor, enlivened by attractive Chinese watercolors on the walls. A bar is to the left of the entrance and up a few stairs there is a second dining room - a long, rather dark room decorated in tones of brown with a fieldstone fireplace at one end. The lighter ambience of the ground-level dining room strikes a more inviting note.
1982-10-10	"DINING OUT;
VIETNAMESE CUISINE IN CHESTER"	"THE old shopping center on Route 24 in Chester is perhaps a more fitting site for a Vietnamese restaurant than its former home in an out-of-the-way country inn in nearby Long Valley.

Van Ngo, who is both owner and cook, has dressed up the simple storefront restaurant with a mural running the length of one wall. It was painted by Pham-Ca, a Vietnamese artist. There are also natural wicker lampshades, open shelves containing Vietnamese food products for sale and a kitchen that is open to the diners."
1982-10-10	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Designer Togs Plus Imports

Current imported and American designer clothing is sold at discounts of 25 to 50 percent at Panache, on Brook Street in Eastchester but with a Scarsdale ZIP code. A mailing list heralds further reductions - during November before the arrival of resort wear and in June when a storewide closeout is followed by a six-week break to ready the store for fall collections.

This week's sale, beginning tomorrow with Columbus Day, means doubled reductions on some suits, coats and separates although newly arrived holiday merchandise is not further reduced. The setting resembles a high-ceilinged living room with one totally mirrored wall, two comfortable couches with a cocktail table between for coffee or tea, plus a surround of women's clothing in sizes 4 to 14.  The two dressing rooms are individual."
1982-10-10	THE FOOD IS SIMPLE, BUT PLEASING	DANBURY IN this era of slick, quick, formula-and-theme restaurants, it is comforting to come across a modest eatery that is as homey and oldfashioned as Strawberry Place on Route 7 just south of Danbury. The tiny, white-frame house with red shutters is set back from the road to the rear of a small shopping complex. It is as simple and straightforward inside as it is outside. The interior decor may remind you of an old-time tea room. There are two dining areas seating 62 persons. In the sunny upstairs room, apple-green and rose-colored tablecloths, gauzy white window curtains, framed flower prints on the walls, and a plethora of hanging plants, all evoke an almost quaint 1930's or 1940's mood. So, too, does the cocktail list, which includes Pimm's Cup, which suggests the owner's English background.
1982-10-10	FRENCH FARE IN A LITTLE HOUSE	SEVERAL months ago, Ma Chaumiere opened in a bright, trim little house a short distance from the center of Smithtown. It makes a sincere effort to prepare and serve a varied selection of provincial and classic French dishes, but the results are generally short of satisfactory. Too many of the dishes are flawed, and the staff and kitchen seem inadequate even for the limited capacity of the two small dining rooms. When the restaurant is nearly filled, as on most weekends, the dinner proceeds at a snail's pace. Even the menus are in short supply at busy times.
1982-10-03	"DINING OUT;
CLASSIC FRENCH IN NYACK BISTRO"	"FOR almost a year, Raoul's has occupied the charming, American brick shell of Nyack's old Village Hall. Reine, Serge and Guy Raoul (owners of the first Raoul's, still on Manhattan's Prince Street), leaving the exterior untouched, have renovated the interior attractively and successfully in the French bistro tradition popular earlier this century. The bistro style begins at the entry doors, etched glass and warm oak that fold back exposing the entire front room and bar, the gleaming wood floors, sculptured pressed tin walls, fluted cast-iron columns rising high to ceilings and stately flower arrangements. The dining room beyond picks up the theme. And a storage house at the rear of the hall has become a sleek, open kitchen connected to the dining areas by a small jail that now keeps nothing but wines.

Raoul's is a classy addition to Nyack's renaissance. Boutiques, antiques shops, galleries, craft shops and interesting restaurants have opened everywhere and with care not to destroy the engaging old architecture of the town. Its turn-of-the-century charm and its closeness to the waterfront give Nyack the aura of a resort town."
1982-10-03	AN ATTRACTIVE WATERFRONT SPOT	STAMFORD JUDGING by the noisy and enthusiastic crowds that the Rusty Scupper has generated in just two months, it must be filling a need: for a waterfront restaurant, an attractive spot for a business lunch, a ''happy hour'' hangout for singles, or all of the above. The first-time visitor will find a good-looking establishment on several levels. Upstairs is the bar area and in both bar and dining room big glass windows look out on a picturesque marina. The shallow, elongated dining area is broken up and is on levels so that even if you aren't seated by the windows, you have a decent water view. Modern textural hangings decorate the walls, and there is a comfortable small lounge if you have to wait for a table. The floors are handsomely tiled and oak tables have decorative blue-andwhite tile inlays.
1982-09-26	OTHER SIDE OF THE DELAWARE	"RESTAURANTS along the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River seem to have a special charm. Even when the food is not extraordinary, it is often remembered as such because of the atmosphere of the restaurant and the beauty of the surrounding countryside.

The Upper Black Eddy Inn is far from being the most attractive restaurant in Bucks County. In fact, the simple interior, with its polished wood tables and casual place mats and napkins, gives it the air of an early American tavern. However, the food is actually a cut above some of the more-elegant restaurants in the area."
1982-09-26	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Beans and Teas In Pleasantville

Simpson & Vail, founded in 1929 on Front Street in Manhattan as an importer of specialty coffee and rare teas, migrated north to Pleasantville this year for both retail and mail-order sales. The expanded catalogue is about to go to 10,000 customers, some of whom order from both city and country homes, depending on the season, and the list can be joined by postcard or by telephone.

A gray half-barn has been remodeled to stock 19 varieties of whole bean coffee and 65 types of bulk teas in wooden crates. In addition, there are 10 sorts of teabags that can be used for a single cup or a gallon, and tea-making accessories; coffee grinders, filters, espresso and drip makers; and storage containers, samplers and gift items from gourmet-shop catalogues.

Coffee beans, which store well in a freezer in a tightly sealed container, are often ordered 10 pounds at a time in single-pound bags with no extra half- or quarter-pound amounts can be ordered as samples. A full-pound supplies about 50 cups."
1982-09-26	RELIABLE ITALIAN IN RIDGEFIELD	RIDGEFIELD ITALIAN is one of the world's great cuisines. One wouldn't always think so if one's experience were limited to the Italian restaurants of Connecticut. Too often a raw tomato sauce serves as the be-all and end-all of the Italian restaurant kitchen, covering fish, fowl and meat indiscriminately. At Anthony's Red Lion on Route 7 in Ridgefield, one won't have one's culinary horizons broadened but a number of Italian dishes are prepared with knowledge and some discipline and there are certain pleasant surprises.
1982-09-26	Dining Out; ELEGANT SETTING, UNEVEN KITCHEN	A number of years ago, Pappagallo, a restaurant that was started in a small building in Glen Head, moved to rather elegant new quarters nearby with a spacious, hexagonal main dining room. Although more French and continental dishes were added after the move, the fine quality of the cooking of what was originally a Northern Italian kitchen seemed to have been maintained. Now, however, both the food and the service have slipped, so that the restaurant deserves no more than one star. Pappagallo is another example of a restaurant that cannot maintain a high level of consistency beyond the pasta course. The entrees are uneven and desserts are a disaster.
1982-09-24	American cooking and classic seafood.	A STYLISH and welcome addition to what is called the Upper Upper East Side, Baumer & Crooks, on Third Avenue near 92d Street, has all the overtones of a plushly upholstered supper club with an especially handsome mahogany bar. Opened last November, this restaurant, with its romantic Art Nouveau decor, is slightly marred by inadequate lighting. This may seem like a mundane consideration in such dramatic surroundings, but it becomes important when you begin to regard a beautiful piece of broiled salmon or fragrant hot steamed mussels in a mustard-brightened broth as obstacle courses. Inadequate lighting at some back tables does the food an injustice in other ways. Much of the pleasure of eating is in noting the color contrasts in foods and garnishes - the rosy red rims of peel left on sliced rounds of sauteed potatoes, the blond apple slices that highlight both the flavor and golden pink tones of sauteed calf's liver and the bright vegetables that accent ginger-glazed pork chops, all hardly discernible in dim lighting.
1982-09-24	Showing ID at the Golden Doors	There are, in truth, two golden doors to the United States. Anyone who wants to keep the front door open to legal immigration, despite the rising nativist and racist pressures, should like the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform bill. So should anyone who wants to close the back door against illegal immigration. That's why the bill, having overwhelmingly passed the Senate, has finally run the gantlet of the House Judiciary Committee. If the House leadership recognizes how broad a consensus the bill represents, it could come before the whole House next week.
1982-09-19	CHINESE DELICACIES BY THE LAKESIDE	TUNG TING, a new Chinese restaurant in Centerport, has been named for Lake Tung Ting in the province of Hunan. The attractive lakeside setting was the inspiration. Lunch is served in the bar, where tables take advantage of the view. Windows in the main dining room overlook the parking lot. The dining room is simply but pleasantly decorated; its fairly large expanse has been divided into sections. Despite a carpeted floor, it is quite noisy and could use a more effective acoustical ceiling. If the noise creates an atmosphere that is short of relaxing, the service, which is well-paced and attentive without being rushed, enhances the dining experience at Tung Ting.
1982-09-19	A TALK WITH PAUL VOLCKER	We are hardly out of the economic woods. But last June, when Paul A. Volcker sat for the first extended on-the-record interview since he became chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, things were worse. Yet even then, with the stock market dismally low and headed lower, with unemployment high and headed higher, with interest rates stuck in what some considered an impossible deadly gridlock - even then, Volcker made a strong case that much of the worst was behind us. That this decade, if we keep our wits about us, could become the reverse of the last one: falling inflation, falling interest rates, rising productivity, rising real wages, falling unemployment. Given today's improved but still precarious environment, it sounds almost too good to be true. Is it possible things could actually go right for a change?
1982-09-19	Dining Out; PEKING DUCK AS IT SHOULD BE	STAMFORD SUDDENLY, after a long drought, Stamford is a culinary garden with new restaurants blooming almost weekly. One of the newest is the Oriental Palace, a Chinese restaurant specializing in Sichuan and Hunan dishes. Located on the Post Road between Stamford and Greenwich in the building that formerly housed another restaurant, Chapter II, the Oriental Palace uses its two ample rooms very simply. The first, as you enter, is a large bar. It leads to an even bigger, oblong dining room, very modestly furnished with Chinese rice-paper globe lanterns overhead and pastel wallpaper with a bamboo motif. Tables are roomy with considerable space between them.
1982-09-17	West Side Indian, East Side steaks.	WE have frequently been asked to suggest good inexpensive restaurants, but in recent months the demand has increased to a steady stream. There is no special trick to finding food that is merely cheap, but the search grows more difficult for those who want meals that are unusual and interesting as well. In this pursuit we are invariably drawn to small ethnic restaurants, such as the two branches of the India Pavilion, one on 56th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, and the other on 54th Street, between First and Second Avenue. The newer 56th Street restaurant is bright and pleasantly decorated, with white walls and folkloric artifacts. The older India Pavilion, a tiny dowstairs boite on the East Side, is unnecessarily shabby, and a bit of sprucing up is on order; consistent airconditioning would also make things more comfortable, especially at tables near the kitchen.
1982-09-12	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Back-to-School Sales With Equanimity

Equanimity in Mount Kisco today turns its private mailing list sale into a public back-to-school special until Saturday, with 20 percent off the ordinary prices on lamps, chairs, wastebaskets, rugs, laundry bags, hangers, storage chests and personalized stationery. Most of these items will remain in stock after Saturday, but at regular prices.

In addition, summer reductions and individual item closeouts last through the end of the month and range from 10 and 50 percent off.  The mailing list, which can be joined with no earlier purchase, also announces details for the chili mix demonstration Oct. 9 and for the second yearly preholiday gathering early in December."
1982-09-12	"DINING OUT;
NORTH ITALIAN FARE IN MONMOUTH"	"CERVINO is a pleasant Northern Italian restaurant worth remembering when visiting the Middletown area of Monmouth County. Situated in premises formerly occupied by the Cobblestones, another restaurant, it was renamed Cervino in honor of the birthplace of the four owners, Renato and Gian Carlos Bruno, Lazaro Venegas and Dino Joyeusaz.

The setting is comfortable enough. There are two dining rooms, the larger of which has a brick fireplace hung with copper pots.  Unfortunately, the lighting is dim and somewhat depressing, which, coupled with small brown print on a cream-colored menu, makes ordering a chore for anyone who doesn't have 20-20 vision."
1982-09-12	"DINING OUT;
A GATHERING PLACE IN ARMONK"	REVIEWED in this space last January as not only an attractive gathering place but also a serious restaurant, Covington, although retaining its reputation for the former has bewilderingly abandoned its reputation as a restaurant offering superior and exciting cuisine. A change in kitchen personnel becomes apparent as the menu continues to offer a number of the dishes made popular by the former chef, and the comparison is often cruel. The kitchen may have all of the components for its former success but the present staff has not discovered as yet the key to producing the completed article - the beguiling way wih fresh herbs, the daring touches of hot pepper, the wisps of puff pastry. Not all the dishes produced by the old kitchen were excellent, but enough were so that on balance Covington rated an easy two stars. Now an averaging of dishes (from inedible to competent) results in a rating of one star and a sinking one at that.
1982-09-12	TORTILLAS IN DOZENS OF WAYS	AMIGOS, a small, bright storefront restaurant that opened earlier this year in Port Washington, looks as though it might have been transported intact directly from downtown Mexico City. Salmon pink walls, tables surfaced in glazed tiles, a poster or two and a serape draped in one corner suggest its ethnic identity without the relentless overdecoration often found in such restaurants here. A constant din, due to the high ceilings and lack of any sound-absorbing material, adds an atmosphere that is typical of unpretentious restaurants in Mexico. The menu lists most of the usual Mexican specialties based mainly on tortillas, the cornmeal or wheat flour flat bread of Mexico. Tortillas rolled and stuffed, baked or fried, come filled with a choice of cheese, chicken, pork or beef. The beef fillings seasoned with onion and peppers were the tastiest, whether in the rolled enchiladas, made with corn tortillas, or the burritos, made with wheat flour tortillas; the fried, folded tacos or the flat tostadas, piled with well-seasoned beef, cheese, lettuce and Amigos' somewhat chunky, mellow and exceedingly pleasant guacamole. But in general, the seasonings at Amigos are fairly bland, making the hot sauce placed on the table a useful condiment.
1982-09-10	RESTAURANTS	WHETHER Rangers or Knicks fans are satisfied with the performances of their teams this season or not, there is cause for cheering among those who want to have a good dinner near Madison Square Garden. Opened just three months ago, the Bistro Bordeaux on Eighth Avenue, between 30th and 31st Streets, turns out stylish versions of authentic bistro-grill dishes at moderate prices. The kitchen is capable of some delicious, well-seasoned and carefully prepared food, and the menu is judiciously planned so that there are no unsold leftovers such as stews or roasts to grow stale. The partners in this new venture - Alain Jones, who runs the dining room, and Gerard Uhrik, the chef - gained experience at Demarchelier on Lexington Avenue. Uncertain about the size of the crowds they will attract, they stick to main courses that are grilled or sauteed to order. The fish, meats and chicken are complemented by savory sauces and by generally firm, fresh vegetables, usually one combination for all main courses on a given day. The menu is, in fact, a valuable object lesson in how to impart style and interest to what is basically short-order cooking.
1982-09-05	"DINING OUT;
A TOUCH OF THE PAST IN CAPE MAY"	"CAPE MAY is outstanding for its preservation of many of the charming buildings from the resort's heyday before the turn of the century. Fortunately for us, the fashionable moved on to other watering holes early in this century and many of the fanciful Victorian houses were left intact instead of being replaced by motels and parking lots.

A handsome example is the large house, circa 1876, next to City Hall, with scrolls and frets on the front porch and high-ceilinged drawing rooms. Now called Alexander's, it has been carefully restored by Diane and Larry Muentz, who make their home upstairs and devote the first floor to their restaurant. It's a family affair, being named after their son, with Mr. Muentz in black tie serving as host and Mrs. Muentz as the cook."
1982-09-05	PRETTY AND DELICIOUS FRENCH FOOD	RIDGEFIELD LE COQ HARDI is a tiny gem of a French nouvelle cuisine restaurant. The restaurant itself is as pretty as the food looks and tastes. In the basement of a completely restored 200-year-old building, a small space that once was a blacksmith's shop has been artfully turned into a stylish, understated restaurant. Original fieldstone walls and log-beamed ceilings have been retained. Two separate, small dining alcoves have been created, with banquettes, inviting pale-pink tablecloths, a single unusual flower on each table and a few pictures of roosters on the walls. The menu at Le Coq Hardi is the first surprise. Completely free of any of the current restaurant cliches, it is a model of originality. One can hardly decide what to order. Fortunately the decisions are few. One chooses among five appetizers, two soups and seven entrees. Everything is cooked to order. The menu changes every few weeks so if you tarry in visiting, you will probably find the choices are different.
1982-09-05	WAITING FOR CONSUMER RATES TO FALL	THE sharp break in interest rates in August was fine for the surgings tock market, but will it help the consumer? Will auto loans and m ortgages get cheaper? Will rates for unsecured loans and credit c ards drop? The answer, according to many analysts, is yes - if the interestrate decline can be sustained. Competition will eventually force lower rates. But for now, consumers planning to make big-ticket purchases should know that rates are still in the high teens - and remarkably, in some cases, they are still rising.
1982-09-05	PASTA TAKES THE SPOTLIGHT	RISTORANTE SAN GIORGIO in Westbury is a pleasantly attractive and friendly Italian restaurant that is small enough for the dining room to be comfortably intimate and yet formal enough to appear fairly elegant. It offers a moderately wide range of mostly typical choices on the printed menus. These are augmented by a list of daily specials so extensive that it is almost impossible to remember them as they are announced. The appetizers are quite well prepared and the pasta is usually excellent, making for an extremely positive impression at first. But then post-pasta depression can set in. The entrees are wildly variable, ranging from a couple of splendid specialties down to others that may be barely edible. The overall assessment of this restaurant remains the same as it was a few years ago - one star - because the high expectations that result from the fine pasta dishes are never fully realized.
1982-09-05	FREE RIDES; Plastic Trade-Off	It was a marketing coup. When virtually every other bank began charging annual fees for MasterCard and Visa accounts, the Bank of New York went against the grain.
1982-09-03	2 stops in Burma, midtown French.	one on Prince Street in SoHo and the original on Henry Street in Chinatown - it is a spicy, diverting cuisine with pungent curries somewhat like those of Thailand. They are served with rice, generally cooked in coconut milk, and two interesting breads - a thousand-layered pancake that is a flat coil of crisp dough much like puff pastry and a grainy ''patty'' that recalls Indian griddle-fried breads. Although chopsticks are available, the Burmese actually eat with forks and spoons, as do the Thais, or with their fingers, as in India. Both restaurants are trim and spotless, have staffs that are friendly and accommodating if unprofessional and offer interesting lunches or dinners at very modest prices. The year-old Henry Street restaurant is tiny. Its three-month-old offspring on Prince Street is a bit larger and more stylish. Neither serves alcoholic beverages, so you may provide your own, an additional saving. It's a pity that the food isn't presented in authentic Burmese style, with big bowls of rice in the center of the table and all the curries in smaller bowls, so that everyone at the table can mix and match at will. A few dishes, such as marvelously tender squid in a chili-spiced curry sauce with vegetables, and shrimp curry and pork curry, at the Henry Street restaurant are served that way, but for the rest, the food is arranged as a blue-plate special.
1982-08-29	"DINING OUT;
HISTORIC SETTING IN SCOTCH PLAINS"	"THE Stage House Inn and Pub in Scotch Plains, which dates from 1737, was originally a stopover on the Swiftsure Stage Line. The building (where Lafayette is said to have stayed) was remodeled during the 1960's, and parts of the dining room wall have been exposed behind glass, so that the original lath construction can be seen.

Several buildings of the same era were transported from other areas of the town and added to the original structure to provide more room. The addition of a number of stores in new but authentically reproduced buildings completes the complex that now exists as the Stage House Inn and Pub."
1982-08-28	COUNTERFEIT SWEATERS AND SHIRTS	THERE was an alligator hunt of sorts on the Lower East Side this w eek, led by inspectors of the city's Department of Consumer Affairs a nd representatives of the company that manufactures Izod Lacoste s hirts and sweaters. Their prey actually was merchants who sold c ounterfeit garments with Lacoste labels and alligator trademarks. The operation, according to Commissioner Simon P. Gourdine, was meant to illustrate the growing problem of trademark and merchandise counterfeiting, which costs private industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Often, the Commissioner said, consumers who believe they are buying respected name brands purchase shoddy, lowquality goods.
1982-08-22	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Any Part of a House, Just About

Fans who rue the day United Housewreckers in Stamford, Conn., became modernized and organized can find the ghost of it at Toddville New and Used Building Materials and Toddville Antiques and Crafts off Crompound Road in the town of Cortlandt east of Peekskill.

New and used doors, plywood, mantelpieces, stained glass, leaded windows, architectural moldings, plumbing, bricks, tools and roofing materials were the beginning of the business in 1951, much of it from New York City as brownstones and other buildings were dismantled.  Later, doll houses, antiques, secondhand furniture, curios and craft materials were added, always off store prices.

Toddville is, naturally, a source for fixtures and fittings when brownstones and other older homes are being restored. A pair of curved top entrance doors - perhaps a way to close off a room with an archway to conserve heat - is marked $225."
1982-08-22	"DINING OUT;
VICTORIAN ECLECTISM IN CAPE MAY"	"DINING under the awning on the veranda of The Mad Batter is a lively experience. Half a block from the beach and nestled among Cape May's Victorian houses with gingerbread rampant, the informal restaurant has the leisurely air of the town itself.

For people watching, the street-side veranda is the place. Inside the circa 1875 hotel is the spacious dining room, its rather spartan decor brightened by skylights, and at the rear is the garden terrace where tables are set out in warm weather."
1982-08-22	JAPANESE FARE IN A 'GREENHOUSE'	THE Japanese restaurants that have opened recently on the Island serve food that is worth recommending, but Kokura II in Woodbury also offers a particularly appealing setting, one that departs from the typical scheme of light wood, paper lamps and Japanese prints. The restaurant is quite spacious, skylit and filled with lush, handsome plants. One section of the dining room is a greenhouse sheathed in bronzed glass. Intimate booths on a platform line one wall, and a sushi bar is set into a separate alcove near the entrance. An oversized decorative fan and a couple of Kabuki-like masks accent one wall of the otherwise pleasantly subdued room.
1982-08-20	From Key West to the Far East.	OPENED three months ago, Claire is a colorful and refreshing addition to the local restaurant scene. Owned by Claire and Marvin Paige, who operate a restaurant of the same name in Key West, Fla., the offspring on Seventh Avenue, between 19th and 20th Streets, borrows much from the original. The breezy interior, designed by Robin Wagner, who did the sets for several Broadway shows, among them ''A Chorus Line,'' combines palm trees, white trellis work, big ceiling fans, mirrors and cool dark green walls. Confetti strips of silk serve as curtains, a clever and festive device. Lighting is as practical as it is dramatic, but the acoustics are poor. Claire is head-splittingly noisy, especially when there is the insistent throb of background music. The menu is as stylishly diverting as the setting, combining Caribbean, Continental and American specialties, modified by the Thai chef, who favors piquant seasonings such as chilies, vinegar, jalapeno peppers, coriander, basil and black pepper.
1982-08-19	FALL IN CONSUMER LOAN RATES SLOWLY COMING, ANALYSTS SAY	The euphoria that has overtaken Wall Street this week will likely mark the starting point for a decline in consumer interest rates and an eventual recovery of American business, a variety of economists predict. To be sure, economists caution, the drop in interest rates that inspired the stock market surge will be slow to spread to the consumer sector of the economy, and even this assumes that the money markets continue their downward slide. Moreover, the recession has left consumers and businesses badly bruised, so it will be some time before their finances are in order and both are ready to spend freely. The optimism on interest rates flows from an economic outlook that means continuing pain for many Americans. That outlook is for an exceptionally weak recovery in coming months, which in turn means continued unemployment and sluggish capital spending.
1982-08-15	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Shopping Forays Are Encouraged

Cold Spring in Putnam County is a small town that has reordered itself to encourage antiquing and other shopping forays, and it is within car range of tourists visiting Boscobel, the 1800's restored mansion. The town also is the site of a two-year effort at the historic preservation of the 1832 Hudson View Inn, newly reopened as Hudson House for hungry day shoppers - and for overnight and weekend visitors - all within an easy stroll of Cold Spring's shops.

Salt of the Earth is the opposite of an antique shop, rather it is an eclectic mix of unusual categories. The merchandise goes on sale at 15 percent off batches - all scarves, hats and handbags, or all Laurel Burch cloisonne, pottery and glassware, depending on the month. For August, that category is new summer clothes and the markdown is doubled to 30 percent. Sizes are 8 to 12, with some smaller and larger."
1982-08-15	GREAT SEAFOOD AND FINE SERVICE	STAMFORD ''WHERE can we get a decent, fresh seafood meal?'' is a question often asked. Surprisingly, in a state bordered on one side by water, there are not too many easy answers to that. Places that specialize in seafood are all too often specialists in greasy batter-frying. But we have found a restaurant specializing in seafood that actually treats fresh fish with respect: Sterling Ocean House in Stamford, on the grounds of the Sterling Farms complex.
1982-08-14	BANKS WEIGH ENDING RETURN OF CHECKS	The American banking industry, facing ever higher costs in postage and paper handling, is moving slowly and cautiously toward ending the practice of returning canceled checks to customers. Several banks have already introduced optional programs designed to wean their retail customers away from receiving canceled checks in the mail, although most large commercial banks are waiting to see how consumers react to the idea. ''The industry is poised to do it if bankers see public acceptance,'' said Dr. James Moore, research director for the Trans Data Corporation, a banking research and consulting concern in Cambridge, Md. ''Operationally almost any bank can start this thing quickly. But upper management is very sensitive to public opinion.''
1982-08-13	East Side meats, West Side charm.	NOW what is such perfectly beautiful meat doing in a place like Lobel's Steak House on Second Avenue and 43d Street? Just about everything except the superb steaks and chops at this two-month-old restaurant is second rate, or even third rate. That assessment includes not only other food, but the setting and service as well. From dried-out tasteless breads and crumbled sesame bread sticks, served with a bitter giveaway chopped liver appetizer, to lackluster potatoes, greasy onion rings and insipid cakes and pies, no food other than the meats deserves serious consideration. Neither does the huge, gloomy dining room, with its maroon-and-gray color scheme and lugubrious lighting, nor does the staff - good-natured enough but forgetful and inept. You may get your check before you ask for it, but it takes three requests for salad dressing, and both bread and wine may be forgotten entirely. Given the top level prices (steaks and chops are $19.50 a portion, strictly a la carte), there is danger that the virtually incomparable beef, lamb and veal will go unappreciated. Only that extraordinary meat and the skill with which it is broiled make Lobel's worth one star.
1982-08-08	"DINING OUT;
NEW SPOT FOR 'LA BONNE CUISINE'"	"IT might be slightly unfair to review a restaurant that has been open five months. Exactly a year before, Rene Chardain and his wife, Anne, left Newfane, Vt., their home for 24 years, and their successful inn, The Four Columns. Rene Chardain's reputation for commitment to ''la bonne cuisine'' and the couple's enthusiasm for the beauty of the new restaurant make their arrival in the county difficult to ignore. And although the grounds and service promise to be more stunning, the mansion and dining rooms could not be.

In the northwest corner of the county, Rene Chardain Restaurant has chosen compatible neighbors in some of Westchester's finest restaurants. His choice is appropriate. His sense of luxe pervades the calm blue dining rooms, the diffused afternoon light throwing smoky shadows on the neoclassic artistry worked in moldings and paint."
1982-08-08	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Just About Everything At Garage Sale Store

In just two years the Garage Sale Store in Pleasantville has become a meeting place for shoppers attracted by its antiques, collectibles, recyclable unused or duplicate gifts and useful household items. In fact, it has been dubbed ''The Pleasantville Museum'' by browsers, who have learned to stop by often instead of missing that bedstead at $50 or a sturdy typewriter table at $3.

The store buys estate-sale leftovers, merchandise from appraisers and gets items from dealers ''who do not want to reduce prices in their own antiques shops to a point that would encourage rapid sales,'' said the store's owner, Jill Goldstone, as she discussed her sources.

''The contents of homes are bought for cash and removed without regard to the potential resale value of any individual item, because I am not an appraiser, and three-quarters of what is here will be gone within two weeks,'' she said."
1982-08-08	Dining Out; APPEALING FARE AT HARBOR'S EDGE	UNLIKE most resort areas, Fire Island has relatively few restaurants, but if dining in one of the communities that dot this stretch of barrier beach seems like an appealing change of pace, a fine choice would be Le Dock in Fair Harbor. Le Dock, on the western end of the island, is accessible by ferry from Bay Shore, water taxi or other maritime transportation, as well as on foot from other locations on Fire Island. The restaurant is situated in a small one-story building at the ferry dock with a view of harborside comings and goings provided by sliding glass doors at one end of the somewhat narrow dining room. It is both intimate and airy, done in white with green flower-sprigged provincial print chair covers, ceiling fans, ship's lanterns and one wall completely mirrored to provide a greater illusion of space. Le Dock is casual in typical Fire Island fashion, but a table laden with desserts near the entrance leaves no doubt about how seriously it takes the matter of fine dining. And shoes are required.
1982-08-08	Dining Out; A GOOD PLACE FOR SEAFOOD	GREENWICH MORE than the name has changed at 409 Greenwich Avenue in Greenwich. What was Tweed's is now Nickleby's. The decor is essentially the same, with a sunken dining well and upper levels front and aft. Circular ceiling fans, a fin de siecle-style, stainedglass panel of yellow and red in the pressed tin ceiling, plants in abundance and a champagne-flocked wall covering are the decorating motifs. The busy and noisy bar is in a long, narrow room on the left as you enter. Good acoustical planning seals off the sound completely from the dining room. A young, cheerful and competent staff enhance the dining experience. The menu is moderately small, but is almost doubled by the number of nightly specials. Basically, it's the standard Connecticut-style continental menu, with several interesting variations.
1982-08-01	NOTHING FANCY, BUT PRICE IS RIGHT	WESTPORT THE minute you turn your back, someone opens another restaurant in Westport. Newest, at this writing, is Dunville's, a lively, noisy eatery located in a modest frame house just two blocks from the Connecticut Turnpike. Dunville's interior is L-shaped and the long, narrow, crowded portion of the L consists of small tables close together in a line, separated from the bar by a low partition. Knotty-pine walls with mirrors and greenery along the sides, brass lighting fixtures and ceiling fans, wood tables with brown paper placemats are the decor elements.
1982-08-01	HEARTY PORTUGUESE SPECIALTIES	WHEN the appetite is in high gear, you may be ready for Arlindo's, the newest of several Portuguese restaurants in Mineola. The typically earthy peasant-style cuisine, well garlicked and often combining pork with seafood, is honestly prepared and very generously served here. The restaurant, in a white stucco building, has a dining room decorated with mirrors, wrought iron and a large, brightly painted scenic mural. Some of the tables surround a dance floor, but except on weekends when a small combo with a vocalist entertains, that section of the dining room remains empty.
1982-07-30	Village steakhouse; and Spanish touch.	SOON after it opened last year, K.O.'s, the atttractive, dramatically lighted modern steakhouse at Bank and Greenwich Streets, rated one star, and two seemed not far behind. That early promise has now been fulfilled because the kitchen staff has developed a more authoritative hand with seasonings and corrected some earlier flaws. The characteristic steakhouse sizzle may still be lacking as meats come from kitchen to table, but that shortcoming is compensated for by the superb quality of the carefully broiled meats and fish, and the diverting side dishes and appetizers that are more stylish than those in the standard steakhouse format. The owners are Karen Ortenzio, whose initials inspired the restaurant's name, and her husband, James, who is a wholesale meat dealer. His experience accounts for the exquisite prime quality of cuts such as rib steak and the porterhouse as well as the sirloin and the filet mignon. As good as the standard steaks are, they are far outdistanced by the juicy rib steak and the well-marbled and, therefore, richly flavored porterhouse for two.
1982-07-25	"DINING OUT;
HUNANESE COOKING IN YONKERS"	"WHEN it opened in 1979, Peng's Yonkers branch made a welcome addition to the restaurants lining lower Central Avenue, Peng's offered at that time the increasingly popular Hunanese-style cooking, one that borrows freely from its neighbors - amalgamating heat from Sichuan and richness from Shanghai. Peng's menu was a cut above that of most Chinese restaurants in the county; the short menu offered relatively few dishes, hinting that they would be choice, and quite a few of them were. The kitchen still provides some fine dishes; however recent visits indicate that it is difficult to be assured of a satisfactory meal here. The kitchen has become careless; preparations lack consistency.

A change in dining room personnel brought further impediment to dining pleasantly at Peng's. Inefficient, poorly trained dining room staff often left the dining room empty handed and the dishes that might have been removed on the tables. Our dessert, for instance, was nestled among bowls of cold, half-eaten rice, long-emptied glasses and serving platters."
1982-07-25	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
A Family-Run Shop Discounts Wallpaper"	"Ultima Designs in Hartsdale always discounts designer wallpaper and textured string and grasscloth wallpapers up to 50 percent, sells designer window fashions, including verticals and Levelors - at 25 to 40 percent off on verticals - and, during August, will have Bali blinds at 40 percent off. Prices drop further during periodic specials spring and winter sales. During July, for example, the bath shop offers an extra 10 percent reduction on already discounted prices.

Ultima is a family-run shop with origins in the Bronx, at the Webster Wall Paper Company. There Tessie and Joseph Nerenberg started with Sanitas and Walltex fabric-backed vinyl design books and one paper-backed wallpaper book - that was 40 years ago in a 10-footfront neighborhood store at 197 Street and Webster Avenue.  Now, that original store has expanded to 5,000 square feet and stocks more than 2,000 wallpaper patterns, all on discount, and Benjamin Moore paint at contractor prices during July."
1982-07-25	REVISED MENU, INTIMATE SETTING	century yellow and brown clapboard house in Roslyn, recently changed hands. A transition period that lasted for several months has been completed, and a revised menu is now in place. Actually, since the same chef has been in charge of the kitchen all along, the menu retains a good many dishes from the prior regime. The food is generally quite good, and if it has fallen just short of two stars on an overall basis recently, the potential for two-star dining still exists.
1982-07-25	PORTIONS ARE SMALL, BUT TASTY	NORWALK IN an era of excessive hype, it is refreshing to come upon a restaurant that bills itself as A Little Something. Such modesty is apparent in the interior decor as well: a small room seating a mere 36, with the small kitchen open to view. There are white walls and a high ceiling with exposed wood beams on which two stuffed owls are perched. Legacies of a previous owner, the waitress explains. The tables in a row down the center of the room are uncomfortably close together, like one long, single table, making the dining experience on busy evenings a bit like family style at summer camp.
1982-07-23	West Side duck, swinging brasserie.	APPARENTLY not afraid of spreading their managerial and culinary talents too thin, the owners of the Peking Duck House in Chinatown and the Beijing Duckhouse on East 52d Street have opened a third outpost near Lincoln Center, on Amsterdam Avenue and 69th Street. Put up outside their month-old Peking Duck West are the reviews from the New York Times awarding two stars to both of the older restaurants. But based on four meals, that level has not yet been reached on the West Side. Nevertheless, this handsome restaurant, with its carpeted, welldecorated dining room, widely spaced tables and formally dressed captains and waiters is already a welcome addition to the neighborhood. There are more than enough competently prepared dishes to make up a satisfying meal, foremost among them being an exceptional Peking duck, which, as is the case at the other two restaurants, need not be ordered in advance. The glistening, roasted duck is brought to the table, where the chef carves it with lightning dexterity. The meaty duck slices, with their glassily crisp skin, wrapped in crepes, are accented by strips of cucumber, wisps of scallions and a fruity, hoisin-based sauce.
1982-07-18	A CULINARY SURPRISE IN STAMFORD	STAMFORD SOME restaurant names telegraph instantly their culinary intentions: Cafe du Fran,caise, The Greenhouse, Viva Quaxaca!, La Scala. No question of the type of cuisine you are likely to experience inside. Then there are names like Bricks - as illuminating as a brick wall. If Bricks, one of Stamford's newest restaurants, suggests anything in its name, it might be solid, reliable, basic food of the hamburger variety.
1982-07-11	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Sports-Store Sale In Ardsley

Leisure time is serious business at Eastern Mountain Sports in Ardsley, where rock climbers, hikers, touring bikers, canoeists, backpackers and campers can buy or rent gear, have it cleaned and repaired and get expert advice.

Full-color books on 50 hiking trails, bike touring, rafting, rock climbing and rappelling abound along with ropes, safety helmets, ice axes and picks. Bota gourd-shaped, 50-ounce canteens for hot or cold beverages are $14 with a Cordura nylon cover; $16 when suede-covered with rawhide lacing."
1982-07-11	SEAFOOD THAT'S FRESH AND SIMPLE	LAST year, Armando's Seafood Barge moved from its original red barge stationed on the beach overlooking Peconic Bay in Southold to a new structure, similar in design but approximately double the size. In all other respects the place is about the same. The stock in trade at this casual, unpretentious, nautically decorated family restaurant remains fresh fish and shellfish, simply prepared. A portion of steamer clams, unmistakably from local waters, were large but nut sweet, with far more character to their texture and flavor than the bland Maryland variety so frequently served on the Island. The mussels were equally distinguished, plump, cleanly fresh-tasting and served in a buttery broth. Both the clams and mussels come in four serving sizes, from a small, appetite-whetting dinner appetizer to a generous main course.
1982-07-11	CONVIVIAL ATMOSPHERE OF A CLUB	IF the Jockey Club were just that - a club -what a satisfactory place it would be. Its atmosphere is convivial, secure, comforting, the personal welcome hard to beat. Frequent diners are greeted clearly, by name, and newcomers are known before the meal ends. The dining room separates into levels corresponding to a theater's orchestra, balcony and boxes, a dramatic arrangement that allows almost everyone in the room to see and be seen; yet attractively-set tables (some with giant brandy snifters filled with flowers), roomy and well-spaced, lend intimacy, if that is desired. But The Jockey Club is willy-nilly a restaurant, and here the illusion shatters. It was not surprising, however, that the appetizer of mysteriously ''nearby'' clams and oysters have remained on the menu since The Jockey Club's beginnings almost three years ago. The clear, sea-sweet mollusks arrived in a rarely-offered combination with cocktail sauce, sharp vinaigrette, and not-quitehead-clearing, freshly-grated horseradish. Equally good were a substantial portion of mildly-smoked trout; perfect, just-barelysteamed asparagus - every bit of the peeled ivory stalk edible; and firm-textured, iced herring, scattered with red onion rings and served with two tiny, delectable boiled new potatoes and a sauce boat of sour cream.
1982-07-11	MAKING THE MOST OF A STRONG DOLLAR	THANKS to the strong United States dollar, Americans are at a distinct advantage traveling abroad. The dollar h as been trading at record levels recently against the French franc a nd Italian lire, and is also very strong against the West German m ark, Swiss franc and Japanese yen. The challenge is how to make the most of this situation. Should a traveler hold onto dollars in advance of a vacation or hurry to buy foreign currency before leaving the United States? Should the vacationer who might be spending $3,000 during his stay abroad buy travelers checks denominated in a foreign currency, or use a credit card as much as possible?
1982-07-04	JAPANESE NEWCOMER IN WESTPORT	WESTPORT FOR lovers of dining diversity, there is cause for rejoicing when a new ethnic restaurant opens somewhere in Connecticut. Thus the arrival of Sakura, a Japanese newcomer to Westport, is welcome news. Distances between Japanese restaurants in the state are far indeed. Sakura offers three different types of dining experiences. First, there is hibachi dining - around a table with a built-in griddle at which a chef cuts and cooks meat, seafood and vegetables using theatrical pyrotechnics while you watch. The performers at Sakura have turned this dubious process into high theater, doing everything but a drum roll with the pepper mill.
1982-07-04	QUALITY WITH CONSISTENCY	IN an area where restaurants are known for their seasonal, if not weekly, ups and downs, finding one that is consistent on as high a level as the Inn at Quogue is a pleasure. The food is appealing and imaginative in a manner that respects both the seasons and the local resources. The preparation is generally very skillful. The dining room is large and somewhat bare-looking except in the porchlike windowed area, where carpeting softens the setting. Tables are covered with printed chintz, and as the weather warms, the airy spaciousness is likely to be more appealing than it was on the damp and chilly June weekends. The Inn at Quogue is unheated.
1982-07-01	BOTANICAL GARDEN SETS CRAFTS FESTIVAL	THE New York Botanical Garden is opening its summer education program with a 13-day Festival of Crafts, beginning Tuesday and continuing through July 18. The festival is a potpourri of one-, twoand four-day courses and workshops that combine crafts techniques with horticultural themes. The courses, which range from quilting and bookbinding to perfumes and edible centerpiece design, are a sampler of the many classes, lectures and tours offered by the garden throughout the year.
1982-06-27	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER	"Clothing Bargains For Young People

Sunny Side Up in Hastings-on Hudson has 30 percent off the original prices on all young people's quality clothing until July 3 - except gifts and accessories - from premature baby items up to size 4 toddler for boys and to size 14 for preteen-age girls.

The store, which opened in November, will feature holiday dresses at 20 percent off by Aug. 1, about the same time the Izod and Jordache fall line will be unveiled at 15 percent off.

Right now the 50 percent-off rack has an assortment of coordinated dressy and casual styles. Matching dresses of polyester and cotton calico with portions of linen-look in an unusual pale green called willow are designed by Marshall Sinclair of Scarsdale. The dresses start at $15.50 for the up to 6X size that was $31; dresses are $18.50, down from $37, in the 7 to 14 version and in a sundress-withjacket cut are $22.50, from $45."
1982-06-25	From Tex-Mex to China and SoHo.	THREE things that are hard to find in New York are inexpensive restaurants, decent Mexican food and good places to eat in the theater district. All three of these needs are fairly well met by El Tenampa, a small, casual cafe on Restaurant Row - 46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Well-spiced Mexican food at low prices is offered for lunch and dinner, and both menus include not only the standard Tex-Mex panoply of such dishes as tamales, tostados, tacos, burritos, flautas, enchiladas and taquitos, but also a full array of chicken, beef and pork specialties, complemented by subtle and heady sauces. These sauces are, in fact, far better than most of the meats they cover and the big flaw at El Tenampa is the poor quality of tough, stringy beef and pork, most of which seems to have been cooked long ago. Chicken can be obtained in most of the same sauces and is far preferable. Done mole poblano style, chicken was blanketed with a dark, smooth bitter-chocolate and toasted-sesame-seed sauce burnished with peppers and garlic. Chicken Veracruz style was distinguished by a chili-brightened peanut sauce, and jalapeno peppers and green tomatoes gave a brassy edge to Tasco-style chicken. Much the same green sauce did as well by firm, fresh shrimp, of which there were only six in each portion. Sour cream and peanut sauce enriched cheese-stuffed chilies nogada pueblo.
1982-06-20	"DINING OUT;
ACROSS THE RIVER, INTO THE WOODS"	"TEN miles across the Hudson River, set among woods, gardens and ponds spurting shaped fountains and harboring ducks and geese, the Bully Boy Chop House has prospered and grown for almost a quarter of a century. The addition to the one-room original roadhouse by the owner, Thomas H. McQuade, has resulted in a charming hodgepodge of rooms, cul-de-sacs, alcoves, fireplaces and staircases. Each area carries a distinct mood, and, although some corners are more attractive than others, none lacks beauty -the flash of brass at the pubby bar; the tiny, correct Victorian lounge; cozy, low-ceilinged Colonial rooms with garden views and wallpaper reflecting the flowers that become swans and water lilies in the glass-walled, bileveled rooms that overlook the ponds.

Perhaps to maintain the loosely Britannic motif, Windsor-style chairs stand by memorabilia of the Easter 1916 Rising, but any historical statement dissolves in the banks of flowers that the manager, James Glesener, takes obvious pleasure in arranging - huge jars of megacephalic peonies, snapdragons, dahlias, daisies and roses."
1982-06-20	DISHES THAT LINGER IN THE MEMORY	OLD GREENWICH WHEN we heard via the culinary grapevine that chef-owner Harvey Edwards was no longer doing the cooking at his small French restaurant, Cafe du Bec Fin, we decided it was time for a series of return visits. In 1979 Mr. Edwards's skillful handling of nouvelle cuisine merited an easy three stars. How in the interim has the restaurant fared? Not to worry. Mr. Edwards has indeed delegated much of the cooking to Victoria Zeph, a French-trained chef in her own right, who studied and worked with Michel Guerard. But she is bringing much the same skill and subtlety to Cafe du Bec Fin that made it such a success in the first place.
1982-06-18	RESTAURANTS	CHINESE food in Paris ranges for the most part from mildly pleasant to poor. So it was hardly exciting to learn that Tse Yang, the expensive new Chinese restaurant that opened on East 51st Street three months ago, is the spinoff of a Paris original. It is certainly the most lavish Chinese restaurant in New York, with intricately worked Chinese motifs hammered into copper wall panels, thick carpeting, large, widely spaced tables with starchy linens, graceful floral arrangements and a black-mirrored ceiling that dramatically reflects candlelit tabletops. There are also a fishless fish tank, an intimate bar and a few private dining rooms. Because the low noise level makes it possible to hold quiet conversations and because the formal and polite captains and waiters make helpful suggestions, a meal at Tse Yang can be relaxing. Only occasionally is the service slow and forgetful. It is the comfort of the place and the only moderately expensive lunches that make this restaurant worth a star. For the sky-high dinner prices (even tea is a la carte at $1.50 a person) and the relatively small portions of pleasant but undistinguished food, it would be rated only fair.
1982-06-16	Pennzoil Cards	The Pennzoil Company said it would discontinue its company credit card program as of Aug. 15.
1982-06-13	"DINING OUT;
NOW, IF ATMOSPHERE'S YOUR DISH..."	"Sipping an aperitif on the terrace and watching a family of ducks waddle along the grassy banks of the Delaware River, all seems right with the world. Tables are set out under the trees on the terrace and in the glass-enclosed garden room, and a more sylvan setting would be hard to find.

This is the Centre Bridge Inn, which stands at the foot of the bridge between the Hunterdon County community of Stockton and New Hope, Pa.

Not as old as it looks, the three-story Colonial-style building was reconstructed after a fire about 20 years ago. The charms of its 18th-century origins were thoughtfully retained, however, and antiques abound in the upstairs sitting rooms and in the spacious main dining room on the ground floor. A walk-in fireplace, old beams and piano music on weekends add to the mellow ambiance."

1982-06-13	TO THE DICKENS AND OTHER AUTHORS BY WAY OF CASSETTE	Paul Kresh is a contributing editor of Stereo Review and is writing a book about the spoken word on records for Prentice-Hall. By PAUL KRESH In Evelyn Waugh's ''A Handful of Dust'' a young Englishman named Tony Last, wandering ill with fever in some South American jungle, is saved by an illiterate old man who nurses him back to health - and then forces him, day after day, to read aloud to him the complete works of Charles Dickens. He keeps promising to let the poor chap go but he will have his Dickens. Even when a rescue party reaches the scene, old Mr. Todd goes so far as to drug his prisoner and hide him away so that young Last can go on reading Dickens to him for the rest of his life. A ghastly fate - and one that Tony could well have avoided had he only waited to get himself lost in that jungle until after the invention of the handy little audio cassette. The Mr. Todds of today can get their Dickens by post and listen to their hearts' content as an actress named Angela Cheyne reads aloud to them, complete and unabridged, the texts of ''David Copperfield,'' ''Oliver Twist,'' ''Great Expectations'' and ''A Tale of Two Cities.'' Miss Cheyne has a soothing, subdued stage voice, and for all I know is a better reader than Tony was.
1982-06-13	INVENTIVE 'NEW AMERICAN' FARE	WITH several years of painstaking restoration completed and the paint barely dry, the Bull's Head Inn in Bridgehampton finally opened for business in the middle of last summer. By the time the season was winding down, the Bull's Head Inn was maintaining a commendable kitchen, matching it with pleasantly competent dining room service. In the Hamptons each new season can be a different ball game. There is a new chef in charge at the Bull's Head Inn this year, but the point of view does not appear to have changed, and, again, evident efforts are being made to use fresh ingredients in an innovative blend of cuisines that might loosely be defined as ''new American.'' There are a few remarkable successes as well as an occasional disappointment on the menu, which undergoes a certain modification from month to month. For the most part, the Bull's Head Inn seems to have picked up where it left off last fall.
1982-06-13	FARE AND DECOR, CALIFORNIA STYLE	WESTPORT WESTPORT has been called ''Beverly Hills East,'' and now, with the opening of a new restaurant, Tanglewoods, it seems the California style is here in full force. An explosion of greenery, hung from rounded baskets and spaced along the ceramic-tile floor, in full-leaved ficus plants, glass tables with driftwood bases, other tables with tile inserts, stylish brass and copper wall sculptures and mobiles, skylights with a view of the trees outside, rattan basket chairs, all add up to a fresh, open, airy look that is exceptionally inviting. Tanglewoods occupies the former Clam Box on the Post Road, but you'd never recognize the old place. The exterior now is a warm, stained brown wood. Inside, the dining areas have been broken into several sections for variety and intimacy. Even the large bar area has sections, with booths, tables and alcoves - varied and attractive groupings.
1982-06-11	A Chinatown find, old-style French.	Finding excellent, interesting and inexpensive food served by a pleasant, efficient staff in a festive, sparklingly clean restaurant may sound like a dream of paradise. Yet it is a dream that seems to come true at Say Eng Look on East Broadway in Chinatown. Now a few doors north of its original location, Say Eng Look is newly done up with flamboyant red walls, Chinese decorative motifs and a fairly effective acoustical ceiling. It even has clean tiled washrooms, a minor miracle in this part of town. The setting makes this restaurant's existence even more surprising because though many Chinatown restaurants offer bargains in food, they usually do so in rooms that are at best nonedescript and more often messy or dirty.
1982-06-06	"DINING OUT;
A CHOICE OF ITALIAN AND OR FRENCH"	"SCANIO'S is a pleasantly casual Italian restaurant in the Bergen County community of Oakland. For the last 12 years, Ted Giandinia has been both owner and chef of the restaurant, which is open for dinner only and at which reservations are not accepted.

Waitress service is pleasant and accommodating, and the food, which is a combination of Northern Italian with a few Southern Italian and French dishes, is satisfying and slightly above average in quality.

As for appetizers, mozzarella en carozza was unusual in that the small triangles of mozzarella cheese were simply breaded and deepfried. The result was less starchy and less greasy than when the dish is made from sandwiches of bread and mozzarella. Also good was a perfectly ripe melon served with lean, salty prosciutto, and the raw beef appetizer named carpaccio. For the latter, paper-thin slices of well-marbled raw beef were arranged on a bed of crisp lettuce and served with an outstanding caper sauce."
1982-06-06	STYLISH DARIEN SPOT REVISITED	DARIEN CONFLICTING reports from readers over the last months prompted a series of return visits to Hienkel's, the stylish restaurant on the Post Road in Darien. Hienkel's is obviously prospering. A new, small dining room has been added beyond the long, handsome bar (with live jazz most evenings). A semi-round room, with heavily textured, coir wall covering and fine wood trim, it shows the same taste and use of high-quality materials as the main dining room, though the style of the new room is more intimate and less formal. The main dining room continues to please. It has limed oak walls on three sides with a planted area along the fourth, fieldstone, wall. Grape ivy cascades from a skylighted atrium and white Bentwood chairs give an understated elegance to the room. It is especially attractive at dinner, when the lights are low (but not dim) and gaslit sconces add a romantic element to the dining experience. The only discordant note: Acoustics. Though the room is small and tables well spaced, the din and clatter ricochet from end to end.
1982-06-06	AN AMBITIOUS FRENCH RESTAURANT	CALLING the place Le Restaurant almost sounds no-frills or generic, but don't be misled. The establishment that has taken the place of Villa Pierre in Glen Cove is anything but. This is a large and extremely ambitious new French restaurant with a kitchen that lacks a consistently sure touch. Dining falls short of elegance as soon as tables fill up and the staff becomes pressured. The shortcomings are more noticeable on busy Saturday evenings. During the week, greater care is taken with preparation and service.
1982-06-06	by Jeanne Clare Ferron; Cool Summer Bargains At Mall Dress Shop	South of the Border, at The Galleria in White Plains, has summer prom gowns of all lengths from $30 to $185 for the laciest of white traditional styles. Many are Jessica's Gunnies of San Francisco, or Gunne Sax, in sheers, pastels and florals with many-tiered skirts and Victorian detailing, often marked down from the original prices. The greatest number are priced at about $60 now. Quilted jackets in a dozen styles enable a dressy coverup on a cool evening for $28, and an all-white lace, unlined skirt sells for $31. Off-white and white blouses marked $27.75 and $32 are now 20 percent off those ticket prices and come in both short and long sleeves. Black full skirts by Whistle Baby are $37, and white mid-calf fullcotton skirts are $25, $30 and $45. Denim prairie skirts are $40 and $42.50 - some a button-front design - and forest green, maroon, navy and rust velvet knickers are $25, down from $40.
1982-05-30	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Decoration Day, Decorations and More"	"Decoration Day in Larchmont has come to mean suitable gifts for any holiday, gifts with taste and imagination and often with custom touches. The six-year-old shop moved nextdoor and quadrupled in size last February, adding wicker and antiques to silk and dried flowers, basketry and bric-a-brac.

Most of the flowers are of silk and are hand-dyed, handmade, handpainted and hand-assembled. One shop specialty is custom bridal orders - head circlets at $30 to $35 or a ribboned nosegay with eyelet ruff at $45. Flower-decorated combs are $10 and $13 and colors can be matched to fabrics.

The botanically correct silk roses at $12.50 will not wilt with time, nor will the hand-painted, cotton dogwood blossoms at $1 each, firmly attached to natural dogwood branches for a $4 labor charge for each dozen flowers. Cosmos are of Dacron in white, pink and purple at $5.50 a spray and are recommended as practical for porches, kitchens and bathrooms."
1982-05-30	"Dining Out;
SUSHI AND SUCH IN HACKENSACK"	"WHEN the word was out that a European-trained Japanese chef had opened a restaurant in downtown Hackensack a couple of months ago, we optimistically wasted no time in getting there.

Hackensack, alas, is not cosmopolitan Fort Lee, with its abundance of Japanese diners-out.  The restaurant, called Miyoshi, still seems to be searching for an identity. Mr. Yoshida, the chef-owner, appears to be torn between Japanese authenticity and catering to the surf-and-turf crowd. A few dishes are above average - beef teriyaki and sushi in particular - but at this early date much of the cookery is neither here nor there."
1982-05-30	THE SANDWICHES ARE STANDOUTS	GLASTONBURY TO a non-hockey fan, Gordie's Place is the antithesis of the image the raucous, fast-moving sport evokes. This handsome restaurant, ensconced in a dramatic, contemporary building reminiscent of a ski lodge, is a study in bright blue and Kelly green, with high ceilings, walls of pine siding, laminated oak tables and attractive dining areas separated for greater intimacy. Clues that the establishment has hockey connections - it is owned by Gordie Howe, the Hartford Whaler superstar - are the numerous artful arrangements of hockey sticks on one wall, hockey shirts displayed along another wall and other Howe memorabilia. These are so well arranged that they enhance the colorful simplicity of the interior design. Accouterments have also been well chosen: stylized hurricane lamps on each table, blue-edged white pottery, antiquestyle glasses and oak and rush-seated chairs. Even the cheerful young waiters and waitresses match the color scheme, in green knit shirts.
1982-05-23	"DINING OUT;
A NEW RESTAURANT AT AN OLD STAND"	"RESTAURANTS in New Jersey have improved steadily over the last few years. For the most part, the menus in the new establishments have been innovative, and the standard of food preparation has been both upgraded and modernized. Because we have come to expect this, we're disappointed when we confront a new restaurant that offers a hackneyed menu and food.

A new restaurant in Bedminster called The Inn was particularly disappointing during several recent visits. It opened on March 1 in premises that were formerly occupied by the Bedminster Inn. The old building has been attractively refurbished in shades of green, beige and white; hunting prints line the walls; a long wooden bar has been added to what was once a cavernous dining room and the entrance has been relocated to the side of the structure."
1982-05-23	Personal Finance; CHECKING ACCOUNTS WITH MONEY-FUNDS	IF you can't beat 'em, join 'em. That seems to be the emerging p hilosophy of the nation's banks toward money market funds, as f inancial institutions across the country begin to link up with theira rchrivals for the consumer's deposits. The vehicle for the new association is often known as a ''sweep'' or ''overflow'' account. It automatically transfers checking account deposits into a money market fund once they exceed a certain, generally high, threshold - typically $2,500 to $3,500 - and just as automatically transfers the money back into the checking account when the checking balance falls too low. Some people are greatly impressed with the new accounts. ''At last, banks will be on an equal footing with money funds,'' said Norman G. Fosback, president of the Institute for Econometric Research of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., an investment advisory organization. Not everyone would go that far, but clearly these offerings merit careful study.
1982-05-23	THE AIM IS QUALITY AND INFORMALITY	ABOUT two years ago, the Secret Road Inn in Miller Place changed hands. Changes in cuisine, in style and even in the dimensions of the place ensued. Instead of a French restaurant occupying a couple of small rooms in an old house, it has become a pleasantly informal seafood restaurant with its main dining room now situated in a skylit, porchlike extension that was added to the rear of the house. The setting is airy and casual in this part of the restaurant, where a working fireplace was also added to enhance the atmosphere in chilly seasons. There is still a raw, unfinished look about it, and a good deal of landscaping needs to be done around the house so the expanse of windows will overlook more than bare earth and construction debris. The other dining rooms are cozy and intimate. The seafood theme is given decorative emphasis. A life-sized hammerhead shark with a mouth full of nasty-looking teeth hangs over the salad bar, the design of a lobster has been worked into the stone fireplace wall, and framed drawings and paintings have been inspired by marine subjects.
1982-05-16	8 CHINESE MENUS TO CHOOSE FROM	NO restaurant on the Island has a menu quite like the one at Dynasty in Roslyn. Inside a small, attractive folder is a collection of mini-menus, one for each category or course - appetizers and soups, poultry, seafood and so forth; eight in all. This arrangement can make ordering rather interesting, especially if each member of a party of four or six selects a dish from a different menu for all to share. The appetizer menu is the most reliable. Not only is the selection an interesting and varied one, but also the results are often very satisfying. Start with Chinese black mushrooms topped with minced pork in a light, soy-based sauce, delicate pork-filled steamed dim sum dumplings or a fluffy pillow of bean curd with savory pork filling its hollowed-out interior. Clams steamed with black beans and garlic were meaty, tender and excellently seasoned.
1982-05-12	Conoco Card Fee	Conoco Inc., the oil subsidiary of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the nation's largest chemical company, said that it would begin charging its distributors a 2 1/2 percent processing fee on all Conoco credit card invoices, beginning June 15.
1982-05-09	HOMESTYLE INDIAN DISHES IN FORDS	"GIVEN the risks involved in opening a restaurant during these financially depressed times, it's amazing how many amateurs are taking the plunge. But those who succeed usually have more than a dream to help them. The best of all guarantees is a good cook.

It was this last factor that prompted Dr. Syed Shahidi and his wife, Dr. Azra Shahidi, both of whom are microbiologists, to open an Indian restaurant in Fords named Sahib. (Fords is a section of Woodbridge Township.)"
1982-05-09	"The Careful Shopper;
Gifts From Everywhere At Discount Prices"	"An international bazaar of gifts is on display at Nardin Fine Arts in Mount Kisco until May 16, marking the departure of this painting and-sculpture gallery, which will reopen under the same name at The Yellow Monkey shopping complex in Cross River in September.  The gifts are from nearly every continent and include wall hangings, masks, sculpture and jewelry at prices 20 percent to 50 percent below the original price here or at comparable shops.

A 200-year-old Persian wall hanging, 3 by 4 feet and formerly marked $350 here, is selling for $150. The colors are primarily red, orange, yellow, black and lavender. A 100-year-old Navajo hanging, 9 by 5 feet and said by Concetta Nardin, the gallery owner, to be worth $2,000, must bring a minimum of $750. It is primarily beige, brown and black, with some red.

The largest hanging is 10 by 6 feet, again Persian, of red, orange, white and black with a rust border and costs $350. Smaller, colorful Persian camel-saddle covers sell for $90 and $200. A multicolored woven, circular African hemp bag, formerly $35, costs $15."
1982-05-09	Dining Out; A COZY SPANISH HIDEAWAY	DARIEN WHO would ever guess from the trim colonial brick facade and the bland Anglo-Saxon name that inside The Peak in Darien is a Spanish restaurant? Nor does the first glance at the interior give away the kitchen's secret. A low ceiling with dark, exposed wood beams and white stucco walls with dark half-timbers suggest the coziness of an old English pub. Only the Talavera and Manises pottery plates and bullfight posters on the walls hint at other possibilities.
1982-05-02	"DINING OUT;
A NEW ATTEMPT AN OLD STAND"	"CAFE LA CAMPAGNA stands smack in the center of tiny Meyersville's four corners. Formerly Phillipe's, this attractive little Morris County spot was taken over a few months ago by Rita Caruso, an accountant by profession who is now engaged in her first restaurant venture.

Instead of having her eyes securely glued to the new restaurant's bottom line, as one might expect, Mrs. Caruso, who serves as hostess, and her small staff appear to have a genuine desire to give their patrons an interesting meal in an engaging setting.

The chef, Franco Lo Re, a native of Sicily who apprenticed in France and at the Priory in New York City, prepares a limited menu of mostly Northern Italian dishes. On two of our three visits, the food was good, but not exceptional. On the third try, it was solidly twostar quality."
1982-05-02	NOT FOR THE FAINT OF APPETITE	NEW owners reopened Mona Lisa in Smithtown on the first of January. Despite a fine reputation, the comfortable Italian restaurant tucked into a shopping center had been closed and remained shuttered for a couple of years. Mona Lisa is quite formal, divided into two dining rooms decorated with mirrors and heavily framed artwork, including a reproduction of the eponymous portrait. An ample contingent of tuxedoed waiters and captains devotes considerable time to elaborate tableside preparation. But despite this setting, the clientele seems to prefer rather casual dress. Apparently the management does not object to male patrons who show up in sweaters instead of jackets.
1982-04-30	RESTAURANTS	restaurant that opened six weeks ago on 55th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, directly across from the City Center. It is especially welcome there since it provides a variety of diverting dishes well-suited to dining before or after performances. It is an adjunct of the International Wine Center in the same building, where wine courses and tastings are held. The restaurant has a long wine-bar, where food is also served, and a casual, handsome dining-room with brick walls, mirrors and green glass lamp shades. Twenty wines may be ordered by the half glass as well as by the full glass, thus enabling ''tastings'' during a meal. The device that makes it possible to keep so many open bottles of wine in good condition is the Cruvinet, a dispenser that holds reds and whites at correct temperatures and automatically pipes nitrogen into bottles to replace wine that is poured, thereby preventing the remaining wine from being oxidized. Although the prices for glasses and half glasses are steep compared to the cost of wine by the bottle, it is interesting to be able to sample several wines. The management of the SoHo Charcuterie served as consultants here, setting up the kitchen, finding a staff and devising menu and recipes.
1982-04-25	A FLAVOR THAT'S 'SOUTHERN ITALIAN'	COULD you guess that Villa D'Ric in Syosset is an Italian restaurant? The word ''villa'' is the clue. ''D'ric'' is more difficult to place. It might be Esperanto. Actually, it is a composite of the first names of the owners, Dominic and Ricky. The design of the restaurant does not immediately suggest Italian dining either. The vestibule and bar as well as the pair of small, comfortable and softly lighted dining rooms are done in quiet beige, with a wall of mirrors and some architectural details between two rooms providing the only elements of design in the tailored scheme.
1982-04-18	"CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Serving White Plains The French Way"	"La Gourmandise, opened four years ago at Maple and Mamaroneck Avenues in White Plains, has established itself as a source for fresh daily office snacks a la Fran,caise. The eclairs and the Napoleons, with either custard or whipped cream and raspberries, are 90 cents each; the plain croissants are 65 cents, but when filled with apricot or chocolate are 75 cents; with almond they are 85 cents, and with ham and cheese are $1.25. Kiwi or strawberry tarts are $1.15, just reduced from the winter price of $1.30; large apple turnovers are 75 cents, and brioche are 60 cents.

A special, chocolate or Grand Marnier egg-shaped cake, in the small size is $4.70 and the larger size is $9.70. Catering service can provide fresh soups, appetizers, quiches, vegetables, salmon, striped bass and lobster, but the hot hors d'oeuvres and the entrees - duck a l'orange, veal marengo, beef bourguignon, chicken fines herbes - and the ratatouille are stored frozen for immediate pickup. Orders are best put in a week ahead, but two or three days are enough for birthday cakes."
1982-04-18	VARIATIONS ON A SPANISH THEME	A SUBTLE adjustment in the name has signaled a radical change at Granados in Glen Head, formerly Meson Granados. Visually the restaurant is the same, telegraphing the Spanish theme with heavy beams, white stucco walls, some wrought iron and paintings of lacedraped senoras. The difference in management only becomes evident once the food is served. It is prepared with far less finesse than in the past. An order of black bean soup yields a crock of tasty but solid black beans, virtually devoid of any liquid. They forgot to make it soup. A garnish of onion, oil and rice is produced only upon request. Sizzling, spicy chorizo sausages, shrimp baked in a heavy garlic sauce and delicately crunchy morsels of fried squid were better first courses.
1982-04-17	Consumer Saturday; A CAUTION ON EASY CREDIT CARD	''MAJOR credit cards available without a credit check,'' one of the many advertisements appearing in newspapers around the country says. The offer may seem irresistible to people who have difficulty obtaining credit cards. The offers are also deceptive, according to the United States Postal Service, the New York State Attorney General's office and the Better Business Bureaus in New York and other cities. At best, consumers who respond will find that they may be able to get a credit card only if they deposit several hundred dollars in a savings account, the agencies say. At worst, they say, applicants may find themselves defrauded of more than $100.
1982-04-16	AMERICAN REGIONAL, INDIAN TRADITIONAL; American regional, Indian traditional.	MUCH is heard these days about the emergence of a new American cuisine, an innovative combination of our own regional cooking with Continental influences. Anyone who doubts that such a cuisine can enjoy high-fashion status, should visit Texarkana, a two-month-old restaurant on 10th Street, in premises formerly occupied by Peter's Backyard. Texarkana, with its adobe peach walls and courtyard atmosphere, is owned by Abe De La Houssaye, who has already attracted a casually stylish crowd that gathers at 9 P.M. and later. What lures this handsome young clientele is not only the attractive, low-key setting but also the enticing adaptations of dishes from the Gulf Coast and Southwestern states. At Texarkana, Mr. De La Houssaye, who is also the chef, displays much the same creativity he exhibits at his first restaurant, La Louisiana. Here he barbecues meat and poultry over mesquite and adds sauces based on jalapeno peppers, sharply burnished homemade ketchup or or horseradish with creme fraiche.
1982-04-16	Advertising; Diners Club Drive for Affluent	NOW that it has Citicorp to play its Daddy Warbucks, Diners Club can afford to raise its voice in the credit card marketplace, where the heavy emphasis these days is on making card holders of the affluent business travelers and their carefully cultivated expense accounts. The 32-year-old operation, acquired last June by Citicorp (which already owned the Carte Blanche card) will be breaking a three-year advertising silence on Monday with a multimillion-dollar, multimedia campaign. Pei-yuan Chia, senior vice president in charge of Citicorp's travel and entertainment cards, declined to be more specific on the budget than ''eight figures,'' which is pretty impressive in itself.
1982-04-14	ARCO: IMPACT OF CREDIT BAN New Canaan, Conn.	From the perspective of the Atlantic Richfield Company, canceling all three million of its credit cards is a bold piece of corporate marketing strategy. But the view from the pumps of Cactus Arco, on Grant Road, in Tucson, Ariz., is not as sanguine. ''It's going to hit us bad,'' said Don Prewitt, the manager for seven years. In the 18 Northeastern and Western states where Arco does business, dealers wonder where customers will go to fill up tomorrow morning, when the blue and silver pieces of plastic become useless.
1982-04-11	CAFE MENU TAKES AMBITIOUS TURN	THE KITCHEN in Great Neck opened about a year ago as a catering shop. A few tables off to one side also permitted informal cafe dining on the spot - for salads, sandwiches, a slice of quiche, desserts and coffee carried from the counter cafeteria style. Within a few months, the table section evolved into a full-fledged restaurant. The takeout area is still in place, but the emphasis has shifted to the restaurant, which has now acquired a beer and wine license and operates almost full time, serving breakfast and lunch six days a week and dinner five. An atmosphere of friendly informality prevails.
1982-04-10	JEWELRY INSURANCE BY THE DAY	ANYONE who has valuable jewelry might be interested in a per-diem, o ut-of-vault insurance policy. It is designed for people who remove t heir jewels from a bank vault for occasional use. The policy p rovides different rates for jewelry when it is in the bank and when i t is in the owner's possession. The United States Liability Insurance Company of King of Prussia, Pa., has recently made the policy available in New York State to holders of MasterCard or Visa credit cards.
1982-04-08	BANKS WILL LINK CASH MACHINES	Twenty-six banks around the country, including three of the nation's largest, announced yesterday that they would link their automatic teller operations so that customers could use the cash machines of any of the participants, anywhere in the country. The biggest members of the group, called Plus System Inc., are California's Bank of America, the nation's largest bank; New York's Chase Manhattan Bank, the third largest, and Chicago's Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, the seventh largest. ''It's another stone out of the regulator's dike,'' said Frederick S. Hammer, senior vice president of Chase, who criticized Government regulations that prohibit banks from doing a full banking business across state lines. Because of these laws, customers will not be allowed to use the Plus System to make deposits in machines outside their own states, but will be able to obtain cash and transfer funds from one account to another.
1982-04-04	"Dining OUt;
MAIN COURSES? ONLY A CHOICE OF 73"	"IN MANY ways, it is a typical American-Italian restaurant, one of any number of clones throughout New Jersey. Yet, Le Bistro has an extra nice feel about it. Situated in a semi-residential section of Elmwood Park (formerly East Paterson), the restaurant is crowded and lively most nights, and on Saturdays it is so busy that patrons stand cheek-by-jowl in the bar and foyer waiting to be paged by loudspeaker when a table becomes available. The fact that reservations are not accepted for small parties has something to do with it; also, word is out about the generous quantities of good, southern Italian food that is offered here.

For the last three and a half years, the restaurant has been run by two brothers, Giuseppe and Francesco Amen, better known as Joe and Frank, who are also the chefs."
1982-04-04	"The Careful Shopper;
An Unusual Collection Of Discounted Items"	"Closeouts Unlimited, on Central Avenue in Scarsdale, is a place to check periodically because the merchandise changes continuously.  Other outlets in the chain are in Peekskill, Poughkeepsie and Port Chester, and all carry a product mix from discounted Easter candies to drills, vises and tools by Buffalo, with quartz watches and refrigerator-storage jars in between.

Discounts vary by item, and sudden closeouts and bankruptcies produce curious inclusions. One-pound solid milk-chocolate rabbits are $1.99; popcorn bunnies are 49 cents; yellow and pink marshmallow rabbits are 39 cents for five; chocolate-coated marshmallow eggs are 89 cents a dozen, and jelly beans are 79 cents for 12 ounces.  Nonflammable decorative grass for use in Easter baskets is 49 cents for two ounces."
1982-04-04	"Dining OUt;
ORDINARY ENTRIES, UNUSUAL ENTREES"	"JOINING the increasing number of fine restaurants that continue to establish themselves upcounty is Silvano's (previously Silvano and Edward's) in Somers. Closed briefly for radical reorganization, the restaurant is open again, and under the professional guidance of Silvano Panizzut, the efficient and pleasant dining room staff is an appropriate complement to some very good food. Richard Zinser, a chef of considerable talent and invention, supervises the kitchen, which produces Continental dishes enhanced by touches from the nouvelle cuisine.

With chef, staff and owner functioning so well together and with the restaurant's crisp and polished rooms - wood beams, fresh flowers and candlelight - all that was missed on one recent chilly evening was a cozy fire on one of the restaurant's old stone hearths."
1982-04-04	GETTING A LOAN WHEN YOU'RE JOBLESS	IF you've lost your job and need some cash, where can you borrow it?T hat's a tough question in the best of times. But these days, ' 'Everyone is worried about unemployment, and anyone can lose a job t hree months from now,'' said Mary Quinn, director of consumer c redit counseling for the National Foundation for Consumer Credit in S ilver Spring, Md., a nonprofit counseling organization. Additional factors are making it harder to get loans today. One, of course, is interest rates. Another is lender skittishness over a steep rise in personal bankruptcies. Three years ago, Congress reformed the bankruptcy law making it vastly easier for individuals to both declare bankruptcy and to protect their assets from creditors. Below is a rundown of the options available, and some tips on how to deal with creditors.
1982-03-28	"Careful Shopper;
Winter Clearance On Clothing and Shoes"	"Intuition in Armonk is clearing dressy and casual winter clothing, lingerie, lounge wear and footwear to make room for displays of spring fashions. The store's owner is in Europe buying winter wares that are not ordinarily sale-priced, but here the savings can be dramatic on luxurious fabric and styling in sizes 4 to 12.

English and Italian sweaters can be as low as $117, reduced from $180. A special sale offers the first sweater at the original price and the second sweater for $1. English manufacturers represented include Louise Parsons, Sarah Dallas, Edina & Lena and Radley of London; Italian sources are Ilaria and Mila Vogue."
1982-03-28	"Dining Out;
HIGH ON THE HOG AT THE SHORE"	"WE OFTEN receive complaints from readers concerning the prices charged by New Jersey restaurants. ''New York'' prices and the feeling of being ''ripped off'' are the phrases usually used.

However, I have never been able to understand why people expect to pay less in a restaurant in New Jersey than they do in New York City. Real-estate prices are admittedly higher in New York, but only in certain areas, and the other factors - salaries, utilities and the cost of the basic ingredients - are comparable."
1982-03-28	IN PURSUIT OF ELEGANCE	VILLA D'ESTE in Floral Park reaches for an image of elegance in its setting, appointments, service and food, but achieves it with only intermittent success. The dining rooms are overdecorated, like a stage set, in a plush turn-of-the-century gaslight style, with red walls, etched and frosted glass globes on the brass light fixtures and paintings in heavy gilt frames. Traylike service plates of silverplate remain on the table until dessert, underneath the chinaware as coasters for the various courses. In contrast to this silver, the flatware is stainless steel. Bud vases, usually containing roses, decorate each table. Although they are silver, they are so heavily tarnished from lack of polishing they look more like copper. While the service is professional and can be extremely accommodating, it is also brusque at times. Captains seem to be edgy, impatient and distinctly unhelpful, especially with the wine book, whose listings frequently do not coincide with the bottles on hand.
1982-03-21	Dining Out;	"THERE'S a new addition to the cluster of Spanish and Portuguese restaurants in Newark. Named Don Pepe for one of its owners, it was opened three months ago by the Lopez brothers. They also run the popular Spain Restaurant in the city's nearby Ironbound section.

Don Pepe is a large establishment with valet parking and a busy bar. The dining rooms seat 300 at a throw, and there is room for up to 700 when the banquet rooms are put to use. Tables are closely packed and usually full. The tone is exuberant."
1982-03-21	"Careful Shopper;
Imported-Tile Prices Reduced This Month"	"Carminart Inc is a direct importer with two warehouses and a retail showroom in Elmsford. Markdowns this month are 10 to 50 percent on decorative ceramic and quarry tile and marble, bathroom fixtures and accessories. The shop offers a do-it-yourself booklet for householders and will sell or rent gloves, grouting saws, notched trowels, utility knives, precision spacers, adhesives and caulks. The owners, who will also recommend contractors, say they welcomes customer calls on mid-project problems.

The Cerdisa tile from Italy ($5.45 down to $4.49 a square foot) and the Heisterholz from Germany ($2.99 down to $1.99) are ceramic tiles meant for floors. The Briare line from France can be used for both floors and walls and is discounted 15 percent. Mosaic porcelain tiles at $1.39 a square foot are usually $2.79, and Spanish quarry tiles begin at $1.19 a square foot."
1982-03-21	Personal Finance; THE NEW LOOK OF THE CREDIT UNION	IT may be time to take a fresh look at your company credit union. T he days when it was simply a place for assembly line workers to get a car loan or save a few dollars a week are over. Credit unions, c ooperative financial institutions composed of people with a common b ond such as the same employer, have become purveyors of s ophisticated financial services and are sometimes a few steps ahead o f their competition for the consumer's dollar - banks and thrift i nstitutions. While services offered, and performance, vary widely, all Federally charted credit unions are allowed to write mortgages as well as consumer loans, and can offer MasterCard and Visa credit cards, frequently charging less than their rivals. They can pay 12 percent or more on passbook savings and NOW accounts and can offer ''wild card'' Individual Retirement Accounts at whatever rates and maturities they wish. Some offer the equivalent of money market funds and even pool members' money to make stock market purchases at reduced brokerage commission rates.

CHINESE HOSPITALITY IN SAYREVILLE"	"SOME time ago, we arrived at a Chinese restaurant at about 9 o'clock on a weeknight. We were told to order quickly because the place was closing. We ordered immediately, all of the courses arrived at the same time and the help, their topcoats already on, stood around waiting for us to leave.

Needless to say, we gulped the food, hardly tasting it. We did not return, nor did we review the restaurant, primarily because of the attitude of the staff."
1982-03-14	AMBITIOUS DISHES AT A BRASSERIE	BRASSERIE ST. GERMAIN in Manhasset, for many years an attractive and comfortable place for informal dining, has recently restyled its dinner menu along more ambitious culinary lines. A number of elaborate dishes, some suggesting a nouvelle cuisine influence, are now listed. This review is largely an assessment of that menu. Although the kitchen can produce a competent assortment of appetizers, as well as the lighter lunch and supper specialties such as quiche and the excellent pizzas baked in the wood-fired brick ovens for which the restaurant has been known, dinner on recent occasions has been marred by main courses that were disappointing and cannot be recommended. That is a serious flaw. One might be content to have a dinner without a satisfactory appetizer or dessert, but without the entree it is no longer a meal.
1982-03-14	FOR A GREETING THAT REALLY SINGS	The golden anniversary of the singing telegram is still a few thousand choruses of ''Happy Birthday'' away but its golden age, it appears, is now. The first greeting, sung over the telephone on July 28, 1933, by a Western Union operator, Lucille Lips, to Rudy Vallee, resulted in a mountain of publicity. The idea quickly caught on, and messengers in olive-drab uniforms, caps and leggings were soon singing greetings in person, a practice discontinued during World War II. After that the messages were sent only by telephone until Western Union abandoned the service in 1974.
1982-03-09	MASTERCARD CLEARED TO OFFER FINANCIAL SERVICES VIA BANKS	Commercial and savings banks that are members of the Mastercard system will start next month to offer card holders discount brokerage services, money market funds and other investment services, Mastercard International and the Fidelity Financial Services Group announced yesterday. Under the plan, member banks and savings institutions will also offer their checking account customers various certificates of deposit, money market certificates and other bank-sponsored investment plans that will place them in direct competition with brokerage houses and bring the one-stop financial supermarket closer. ''For the first time,'' said Russell E. Hogg, president and chief executive officer of Mastercard, ''investments in money market funds will be available to holders of checking accounts and Mastercard credit cards issued by commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan institutions through a facility of Fidelity, which manages many leading securities and money market funds.'' The new range of banking services will be introduced in April by a cross section of the 12,500 American banks and thrift institutions that are members of Mastercard, Mr. Hogg said, and gradually be extended to all members ''once the pilot test program is proven satisfactory.''
1982-03-07	"Dining Out;
FIRST WINE BAR OPENS IN COUNTY"	"OPEN only three months, Saint Martin's Wine House in Mount Kisco, the first wine bar in the county, follows a fashionable and welcome trend. Although at 900 bottles the bar is only half-stocked, 90 types of wine are represented, a selection more than ample for both diners and tasters. (Special informal wine tasting takes place on Fridays and Saturdays).

New to the business, the young owners and cooks Irene and Stephan Broburg nevertheless bring to it an old passion for wine and food.  For besides the bread and variety of cheeses that one ordinarily expects to find in a wine bar, Saint Martin's kitchen produces some commendable dishes, wholesome and savory."
1982-03-07	"Dining Out;
NEW FACES AT THE SHORT HILLS MALL"	"IN THE last few months, two attractive restaurants have opened at the recently expanded Short Hills Mall. Strikingly different in decor, yet similar in their wildly eclectic menus, both The Bakers Garden and Meriwether's are well suited to this up-market shopping center.

The fact that the restaurants are units of corporate chains, that their menus smack of market research and microwave ovens and that both have frequent table turnover all through the day means that the fare will not take your breath away with its excellence. But for what it is - moderately priced food of a standardized quality that ranges from quiches to nachos to substantial entrees - both places do a creditable job."
1982-03-03	ARCO, STRESSING PRICE, TO END CREDIT CARD USE	The Atlantic Richfield Company, convinced that price has become more important to gasoline buyers than service, said today that it will stop accepting purchases on its credit cards on April 15. Arco, with 3 million accounts, ranks seventh among the nation's gasoline purveyors in number of credit card accounts. Amoco, with 7 million accounts, and Exxon, with 6.5 million, head the list. In doing away with credit card sales, the nation's eighth-largest gasoline retailer said it will be able to cut its wholesale price to distributors and dealers by nearly 3 cents a gallon. That is the amount that the company said its 3 million credit cards have been costing to service.
1982-02-28	"DINING OUT;
SUCCESS WHERE OTHERS HAVE FAILED"	"FOR years, Chinese restaurants have attempted to establish themselves in the Arcadian Shopping Center in Ossining, but Hunan Gourmet, the present occupant, appears to have triumphed where others have failed. Open for a year now, the restaurant is a solid addition to county dining places and especially to those in the inadequately served Ossining area. Hunan Gourmet offers some interesting Chinese cooking at moderate prices. To the kitchen's credit, dishes marked hot and spicy on the menu come to the table just that way.

Although a plate of meaty, well-marinated spareribs made a respectable option, appetizers in general were overshadowed by smashing dumplings. Hunan Gourmet's marvelous steamed version, much like a specialty of Soochow, just south of Shanghai, is one rarely found in Chinese restaurants here. Softer and looser than the common article, the super-thin skin wraps a meaty center that is juicier than usual. Fried dumplings ran a close second."
1982-02-28	"CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Fabric Bargains And How to Use Them"	"Stretch and Sew Fabrics in Hartsdale is having a winter fabric clearance with 40 to 70 percent reductions for the next two weeks.  The sale items include sweater knits, Irish tweed knits, Qiana crepe knits, challis knits and knit velvets.

The store, part of a 12-year-old nationwide franchise, is also featuring standard demonstrator sewing machines by Viking, Pfaff and New Home reduced 40 to 60 percent from the usual $270 to $1,399, the latter figure for a computerized machine. There are up to 25 percent discounts on Bernina machines, and today is the last day for double trade-in value on the new Bernina models 830 (usually $1,099) and 900 ($949). Also, all cabinets are half price."
1982-02-28	"DINING OUT;
SEAFOOD DOWN BY THE BEAUTIFUL SEA"	"CUT PRICE lobster dinners or ''all you can eat'' seafood buffets are not the mark of a good seafood restaurant. It is the quality and freshness of the seafood, plus the care taken in preparing it.  Unfortunately, too many restaurants settle for quantity and low prices, rather than quality, to attract customers,

This is not the case with Doris & Ed's in Highlands. The seafood tastes as though it were caught minutes before being exposed to heat, and the heat is applied sparingly; thus, in most cases the finished dish is cooked to exactly the right degree of moist savoriness."
1982-02-28	THE CHEF MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE	IL VILLAGGIO in Roslyn is in a building that, until it was beautifully renovated several years ago, had been an automobile showroom. Actually, Il Villaggio is the third restaurant to inhabit these premises. The large, high-ceilinged space is given a rosy glow from walls of exposed brick and a terra cotta-colored ceiling. Mirrors and chandeliers add dressy but understated glitter, and the tables are formally set. The menu is again Continental, but with the emphasis on Italian rather than French specialties. Franco diLullo, who used to own Ristorante Marangola in Bayville, has joined forces with the management here, and he frequently presides over the kitchen. Therein lies the problem. On evenings when he is not doing the cooking, the quality of the food suffers. If one could be guaranteed that Mr. diLullo would stay in chef's whites instead of the host's tuxedo, the restaurant would probably merit two stars.
1982-02-28	INVITING AMBIENCE IN NEW HAVEN	NEW HAVEN UNLIKE its namesake in New Orleans, New Haven's Bourbon Street, a restaurant, has a lot going for it. The ambience in the Bourbon Street Cafe is agreeable and inviting. A huge space has been artfully divided into several dining sections, with a long bar and cafe tables on the left. As you enter there are a few tables used at lunch and a larger-than-life painted backdrop of jazz musicians. To the right, a raised area that is separated by hanging plants provides a dining space suggesting seclusion, with comfortable banquettes that wrap around the entire side wall. Soft, taped jazz provides a pleasing background, and there is live music each evening from 9 P.M. Kelly green lampshades overhead, green napkins and a front window cleverly screened with greenery contrast with white tablecloths set with milk-glass vases full of white chrysanthemums. Service is thoughtful, friendly and well trained. Silver is replaced between courses, for example.
1982-02-21	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Duds for Sale or Rent, New or Recycled"	"The Workingman's Closet in New Rochelle has a price card for sturdy, new washable work-place apparel for men and women that lists the charges for used work clothes on the other side. The highest prices on the reverse side are $7 for hip-length or Eisenhower-length outer jackets, $12 for coveralls and $15 for blazers. Those prices are dropped through April, with a two-for-one sale on overstocked used clothing, marking shirts to $1, pants and smocks to $1.50, and shopcoats and lab gowns to $2.50 each if two are purchased.

The company, which celebrates its first birthday this week, is primarily retail, but also sells and rents on a wholesale basis and can clean greasy or tarred clothing, or gritty dropcloths, within three days. Zip-out liners for a jacket, lab gowns, jackets and coveralls cost $1 to wash, parkas cost $2 and dropcloths are $3, with aprons 60 cents, work shirts and smocks 75 cents and pants 90 cents."
1982-02-21	ITALIAN SKILL AND CARE IN HARTFORD	HARTFORD IF one had to summarize with a single word Carbone's - an oldtimer on the Hartford restaurant scene - it could well be ''professionalism.'' From the friendly efficiency of the front-room staff to the careful, knowledgeable kitchen preparation, a meal at Carbone's is an example of a restaurant that knows what it is doing. Considering that the 43-year-old establishment is in its fourth generation of family ownership, perhaps this should not be surprising. Carbone specializes in northern Italian cuisine. The menu lists each dish by its Italian name, with concise description in English. Mozzarella fritta marinara, for example, is ''fried mozzarella cheese topped with tomato sauce.'' No romanticized phrasing. Carbone's lets the food speak for itself.
1982-02-19	Thai atmosphere and a lively pub.	''SAWATDEE,'' we are told, means ''welcome'' in Thai. To New Yorkers, and especially those living on the Upper West Side, the huge, two month-old Baan Thai restaurant on Broadway, between 102d and 103d Streets, deserves a heartfelt ''sawatdee.'' Although New York has its share of very good Thai restaurants, few offer anything in the way of atmosphere, and none approach this newcomer for elaborateness and color. Baan, the management said, means a country house, and Baan Thai reflects the theme with the traditional Thai trapezoidal arch repeated in doorways, niches and frames on rustic wood-panel walls, and with Thai dance masks and artifacts displayed around the room. Sprays of tiny purple orchids, a lavish low buffet of fruit and golden custard desserts and waitresses wearing graceful fitted silk tunics, add convincing touches. This is the only restaurant we have found in New York that offers traditional Thai service in alcoves seating as many as eight people in relative privacy. Floor cushions and pyramid-shape bolsters are authentic, although not quite authentically used; in Thailand, diners sit on the floor with legs crossed in front of them, but in Baan Thai, the cushions are grouped around a pit into which legs dangle while the diners eat from a low carved table.
1982-02-14	"The Careful Shopper;
Extra Savings For a Birthday Sale"	"Denim Mine in the Bazaar of Mount Kisco Mall is having a presidential birthday sale until Feb. 21, and prices usually discounted 20 percent are reduced an additional 50 to 70 percent.  The four-year-old store carries nationally advertised ladies' basic clothing in sizes 4 to 18 and juniors from 3 to 15; girls' 7 to 14; men's 25 waist to 52 waist and boys' sizes 8 through 20.

Down outerwear is at half price, including vests, jackets and coats for all ages - mostly Pacific Trail. Uraguayan bulky handknit sweaters are $45, reduced from $69.99. Some men's thermal underwear is $6 to $8 and Duofold thermal underwear for both men and women is $9.99, elsewhere $16. Hansen of Wisconsin knit hats known as Pretzels - some with brims -gloves and tam-o'-shanters are $3. They were $9 to $20 elsewhere. Many scarves are $4. Men's tweed jackets by Levi, $90.89 before the sale, are now $76.77. Clearance racks at the entrance include men's and women's shirts at $5 and $9.99 and pants from $9.99 to $19.99."
1982-02-14	"Dining Out;
JAPANESE SPOT OPENS IN THE NORTH"	"IT might seem unfair to comment upon a restaurant that has been open for only two weeks; however, because upcounty dining places represent so few cuisines, and certainly none in the traditional Japanese style, Cho Cho San in Thornwood, seconds off the Saw Mill River Parkway, merits special interest.

The small dining rooms are simply and tastefully decorated in sleek Japanese style: blond furnishings and sparse, colorful floral arrangements blend against a backdrop of shoji. Seating eight or nine, a sushi bar displays a glowing array of fresh fish in a low, icy glass showcase. Although the narrow menu holds no surprises, both sushi bar and kitchen, under the management of Ray Kono, produce satisfying Japanese dishes."
1982-02-14	Dining Out; A WELCOME JAPANESE ADDITION	NEW HAVEN GOOD entry-level vibrations are no guarantee of a satisfactory dining experience. Fortunately, at Hatsune, a new Japanese restaurant in New Haven, they are a happy portent of good things to come. This cozy two-dining room establishment is a welcome outpost of things Japanese. Chopsticks are at each place setting, and on each natural pine table is a small ceramic vase filled with fresh chrysanthemums. The waiters and waitresses, mostly Caucasian, are dressed in traditional blue/ black happi coats and are unusually friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the food.
1982-02-07	"Dining Out;
TASTEFUL SURROUNDINGS IN BREWSTER"	"ATTRCTIVELY set in woody isolation at the top of a steep driveway, The Arch continues to be one of the area's uniquely charming dining places. Within the roomy country house, the polished dining rooms extend welcome with rich wood tones, comfortable chairs, roses and romantic candlelight at well-spaced tables, opulent silk flower arrangements that pick up the draperies' motif , firelight in one room, lush fo liage in another. One has the feeling of dining in someone's tas tefully decorated home rather than in a restaurant.

The trouble with such gracious surroundings is, of course, that they heighten expectations for the food. After four visits, we must conclude that the inconsistent kitchen sometimes betrays the dining room. Dishes superb on one visit proved only fair on another.  Sampled on four different occasions, coulibiac, for instance, arrived one time as a dense, ravishingly light, melting mixture of sole mousse studded with bits of salmon, the buttery whole wafting dill and bound in pastry crust. Another time it was strongly fishy and laved with an unappetizingly aquamarine sauce."
1982-02-07	GREEK FARE IN A CAFE ATMOSPHERE	FOR the last year, Cafe Lindos has been a particularly pleasant addition to Smithtown's Main Street restaurant row. The word cafe in the name tells it all. The atmosphere is that of an informal coffeehouse with assorted desserts and pastries, but complete lunches and dinners are also served. The hours are flexible in that almost any item on the menu may be ordered at any time. Greek music is playing constantly, providing a better clue to the ethnic character of the restaurant than the decor, an understated combination of flower-sprigged navy blue prints against white walls punctuated by a series of arches. Round imitation butcher block tables and bentwood chairs with cane seats are set with paper place mats during the day and tablecloths in the evening, when the lighting is very subdued. In fact, candles on the tables would provide a nicely warm touch after dark.
1982-02-05	RESTAURANTS	T first glance, Le Cherche-Midi, which opened four months ago on First Avenue between 51st and 52d Street, looks like a winner. And judging by the almost full house there the four times we visited, it is already attracting a loyal coterie. Simply but handsomely designed to suggest a countrified Proven,cale setting, Le Cherche-Midi's rough white walls, terra cotta tile floors, baskets, antique accessories and delicate floral arrangements create a clean, gentle and unpretentious background. The menu has equal charm and appeal. But though dinner here turns out to be an above-average experience, the basic plan is seriously flawed. Tables are jammed together, chairs are skimpy and uncomfortable, the room is noisy when full and main courses are heaped on plates so small that it is almost impossible to cut through a chicken breast or a half duck without scattering rice or vegetables across the table. In addition, these plates are served so hot that it is impossible to give them a steadying touch while cutting meat. And whoever designed Le Cherche-Midi's interior should also have realized that at busy times the kitchen doors swing out to hit customers backed up at the checkroom, and that some of the spotlights glare into the faces of diners.
1982-01-31	"Dining Out;
NEW ARMONK SPOT MAKING A MARK"	"OPEN only six weeks, Covington in Armonk has already earned a reputation as a congenial gathering place and as a serious restaurant offering innovative and often superior dishes. Adjoining the beautiful imported English pub, the dining room repeats its intimate ambience in the dark paneling, deep red and dark green walls.  Upstairs, the main dining room with pale walls, blond furniture and soft classical music is less moody and has its own charm.

Covington's wieldy menu lists a relatively small number of dishes augmented by several daily specials. Michael Braun, the chef, has developed his own style, influenced by French nouvelle cuisine but not slave to it. Combinations of meats, fish, mousses or forcemeats bound lightly by a leaf or two of puff pastry are among his most successful creations and have become his signature."
1982-01-31	"The Careful Shopper;
Some Select Choices An d Prices in Hartsdale"	"First-quality name brand and designer clothing for men and women is carried at discount prices in Hartsdale by Annie Sez, the only New York branch of a New Jersey chain of six stores under that name.  Tickets show a ''before discount'' price that represents the average charged at four competing stores, plus gradual reductions and the current price.
Final-sale items are not returnable, but other items, including clearly marke d irregulars, can be returned within two weeks for a refund or sto re credit. Sizes are small to extra large for men and 3 to 16 for wom en."
1982-01-31	"Dining Out;
A MELTING-POT AMERICAN MENU"	"ONE of the advantages of living in a state as steeped in history as New Jersey is the abundance of old country inns such as Pfenninger's Perryville Inn in Hampton. According to Murphy Pfenninger, who bought and restored the 169-year-old inn two and a half years ago, it was named for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, who defeated the British at Lake Erie the year that construction on the inn was completed.

In its early years, the inn was used as a stopover during cattle drives. At some time during its history, the name was changed to The Old Brick Inn, and in 1959 it was moved to Hampton from its original location on Route 78."
1982-01-29	Restaurants; Ex-SoHo favorite thrives in Chelsea.	THE reopening of the Ballroom, the popular cabaret-restaurant, is welcome news to the many devotees of this bright, lively and very original establishment. Opened in SoHo in 1973, the Ballroom closed two and a half years ago when its rent soared. After a long search, the owners found and decorated new quarters. Renamed the New Ballroom and installed in a handsome setting on 28th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues in Chelsea, the restaurant offers the same combination of entertainment along with diverting, innovative food. The New Ballroom is three times the size of the original, with almost unlimited parking space at night. The outer, informal cafedining room with a huge bar from a 1922 Bronx speak-easy, echoes the airy, countrified feeling of the original restaurant. It is here that the celebrated painting of SoHo art habitues by Marion Pinto now hangs. Cheerfully sunlit at lunch, this cafe is also open for dinner, when a pianist plays intermittently. The cabaret-supper club is suitably dark and dramatic, with Art Deco overtones. In addition to offering live entertainment, its stage is home for the much-publicized reproducing grand piano that plays rolls by such luminaries as Gershwin, Rachmaninoff and Paderewski. This Knabe plays itself miraculously, eerily and sometimes intrusively between evening shows and during brunch.
1982-01-24	"Dining Out;
THE SEASONS- ON THE WATERFRONT"	"MR. B's is a most attractive addition to county dining places. Open since early last month, the restaurant occupies the site of the old Washington Arms and the more recent Lil's. We have always thought it odd that restaurants bordering Mamaroneck Harbor and Park have not taken full advantage of that interesting and beautiful prospect. But from almost anywhere in Mr. B's (for Mr. Walter Bodenstein's) bilevel dining room - reminiscent of a luxury liner - diners can enjoy the changing seasons through the curving wall of windows that wrap around almost half the restaurant - snow drifting under street lamps, famous pink cherry blossoms blooming in the lush park, bustling harbor, dazzling autumn foliage.

Radically redecorated, the capacious dining area has been cleverly partitioned and arranged to give a feeling of intimacy. Glamorous, glittering pin lights and candlelight lend a festive glow after dark."
1982-01-24	"The Careful Shopper;
Shop Doubles in Size, Some Prices Cut in Half"	"Josh n Abby in Hartsdale tickets all merchandise with two prices: list price and its own. This month, prices on first-quality winter merchandise are reduced as much as 50 percent off list until the end of the month. Spring items are discounted by 10 percent or more.

The shop, which opened six years ago, has doubled in size since last March. Sizes run from newborn and layettes to 14 and preteen for girls, and to 20 and huskies for boys."
1982-01-24	Dining Out; EATING SIMPLY, CHEAPLY AND WELL	EVERY now and then we come across unpretentious eateries that serve the needs of a specific local clientele, featuring respectable food decently prepared, for the most part, and served in a modest setting. The following are our latest finds. C'est Cheese Charcuterie, second level, Hartford Civic Center, Hartford. 249-1081. Open: 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. Monday through Saturday. Credit cards: MasterCard and Visa.
1982-01-22	Credit Card Holders W in a Billing Battle	Citibank has agreed to pay $50 to any of its Visa or Mastercard customers who can show that the ''improper handling of billing errors'' subjected them to ''needless inconvenience, embarrassment and suspension of credit card privileges,'' the State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, announced yesterday. Richard C. Kane, Citibank senior vice president, said problems started in 1979 with a dramatic increase in the credit cards.
1982-01-17	"The Careful Shopper;
Store's Winter Sale Has Some Fall Bargains"	A winter sale of sportswear and casual clothes is on at Jeri's, near the Hartsdale train station, but a few summer and fall items in the backroom are marked down 50 percent. At the front of the store, prices vary from 20 percent - on gloves, bags, belts, scarves, jewelry and accessories - to 30 percent - on skirts, shirts, sweaters, pants and robes - and to 40 percent off on blazers, jackets and dresses. All prices are adjusted at the register. Early spring merchandise is 30 percent off, and the shop carries sizes 4 to 16.
1982-01-17	"Dining Out;
A CHOICE OF SPANISH OR PORTUGUESE"	"EL PESCADOR in Roselle Park is not for diners with timid palates.  Neither is it recommended for those who blanch at the idea of primary colors used with abandon, or fishing nets, hawsers and fishing trophies used to decorate a dining room. However, for those who delight in brightly colored, noisy restaurants, and decent Portuguese and Spanish food, El Pescador is worth a visit.

The five-year-old restaurant, owned by Manuel and Maria Martins, has large rooms for private parties, as well as a public dining room. The black-coated waiters are efficient, friendly and accommodating and are knowledgeable enough to answer questions about the preparation of dishes on the menu."
1982-01-17	Dining Out; ITALIAN CUISINE AND A RIVER VIEW	STAMFORD IF restaurant ratings were based on service, Rugantino's, an Italian restaurant on the Post Road between Stamford and Darien, would be at the head of the class. The service, based on three recent visits (two lunches and one dinner) was consistently professional, accommodating and friendly. Unfortunately, consistency is a word that cannot be properly applied to the cuisine. The food soared at dinner from a one-star (good) to an occasional two-star (very good), then plummeted at one lunch in which all the entrees were nearly inedible. Over all, we would have to categorize the culinary performance as fair. The potential is there, but the erratic performance suggests inadequate supervision in the kitchen, especially at lunchtime.
1982-01-15	Restaurants; Village steakhouse, East Side glitter.	ONE of the more encouraging restaurant trends recently has been the break with cliche settings. The stuffy, traditional upholstered dining ''salon'' is no longer considered the only appropriate setting for fine French food and somewhere along the way everyone realized that you can have a good seafood dinner without a roomful of corkfloats and fish nets. But steakhouses have been among the last strongholds of such dated imagery. For the most part, they have stuck to noisy, no-frills settings with unflattering lighting, as though diners would only take their beef seriously in ''masculine'' surroundings. Now, however, there is a promising departure in Greenwich Village, at Ba nk and G reenwich Streets, where K.O.'s has been in operation forthe last thre e months. The standard steakhouse menu of broiled meats,chops and fis h are offered against a stunning and romantic modern cafe-restaura nt backdrop. Street lamps shining through huge windows combine with candles on tables to provide a theatrical background, and half-curt ains lend snugness even as they afford a stage-set view of old browns tones. The friendly and casual staff and management complete the felicitous effect.
1982-01-11	CITIBANK WILL RAISE FEE ON CHARGE CARDS TO $20	Citibank, New York's largest bank and the nation's second-largest, will increase the annual fee it charges on its Visa and MasterCard credit cards to $20 from $15, an official con firmed last Friday. The new rate will become effective March 2. Citibank's new fee will match that charged by the First National Bank of Chicago, the highest in the country, according to Citibank. Citibank, with more than five million accounts, is the nation's largest issuer of bank credit cards, followed by the Bank of America, the nation's largest bank.
1982-01-10	Dining Out; WHERE PASTA STANDS OUT	AT Ciro's, which opened several months ago in Merrick, a table in the center of the dining room bears a pyramid of dried, golden homemade noodles. It is an attractive and appropriate centerpiece display. Not only is the list of pasta dishes on the menu longer than any other category, but also their preparation is consistently fine. Ciro's is a family-run restaurant that has strong two-star potential. Pasta can begin the meal in small, shared portions or larger single servings. Linguine in a well-seasoned basil pesto sauce, spicy tortellini coated with a creamy tomato cardinale sauce, spaghetti notturno - which is essentially the same as the vibrant, olive-laced puttanesca sauce - and spaghetti carbonara, finished with a gentle egg, onion, ham and cheese mixture, were all excellent.
1982-01-08	Restaurants; East Side Italian, Broadway seafood.	IF the food is Italian, it must be 58th Street. The block between Second and Third Avenues now has 10 Italian restaurants, including the newest, Anche Vivolo. ''Anche'' means ''also'' in Italian and Vivolo is the name of the parent restaurant, which has been a successful neighborhood hangout on East 74th Street for the last four years. Unfortunately, the new restaurant occupies a singularly uncomfortable space, noisy and cramped under a low ceiling and with so many angles and diagonals that it affords no comfortable areas for tables. Heat builds up around seats against the wall and tiny, roundbottomed vases (usually with wilted roses) tend to topple. The manners of the young waiters suggest an underlying insolence, and the kitchen can be painfully slow. Such flaws are difficult to explain in a place run by professionals of long standing who have had more than two months to smooth out the rough spots. The small but interesting menu is the same here as at the uptown Vivolo, and there are also a half dozen daily specials called out by waiters -without benefit of prices. Though most of the food is edible, the kitchen's performance does not merit the one-star rating given the uptown Vivolo.
1982-01-03	"The Careful Shopper;
Fresh, Dried Flowers At Preserved Prices"	"Holiday decorations at Miss Plum's Particulars, ''The Old Fashioned Store,'' in Westport, Conn., are going fast now, at half-price until the shop closes Jan. 15 for two weeks. When it reopens Feb. 1, Miss Plum's will be ready for Valentine's Day. The constant weekend - and sometimes mid-week - bargain is the four fragrent, locally grown miniature roses for $2. Preservation of that $2 limit despite rising wholesale costs is a matter of principle for the owner, David Quigley.

Not all varieties of fresh flowers are found so close to home.  Trips to 28th Street in New York City are usually mandatory before major projects such as wedding receptions. Mr. Quigley handpicks buds and blossoms at his own and friends' gardens, drying them from the rafters of the cottage for use in arrangements and for his own potpourri. Unprotected wildflowers are seasoned and used and the mix of real and unreal flower displays creates a remarkable effect."
1981-12-27	The Careful Shopper; Men's Shop Features Gentlemanly Discounts	The buying power of 214 stores allows Windsor Men's Shop in White Plains to stock designer names and still call itself the gentlemen's discount center. Post-holiday ''two-fer'' suit, sportcoat, slack and outerwear sales this week makes prices even lower while the usual one-half off on designer ties, belts, socks and handkerchiefs remains in effect and all labels are left on. Gift certificates go twice as far when $126.95 purchases a 100 percent wool blue blazer with brass buttons ($69.90), a Hardy Amies, English-made, Italian wool challis tie ($9.25), gray flannel pants ($32.90) and a designer no-iron shirt ($14.90), taxes and alterations not included. The money ''saved'' might be splurged on the total luxury of a full-fashioned two-ply cashmere sweater, made in the United States with Central Asian goathair, at $99.90, carried elsewhere at $195, or for cotton velour shirts with collars and three buttons, or V-necks, in stripes and solids at $22.90, usually $37.50.
1981-12-27	Dining Out; ITALIAN FAMILIARITY IN CLIFFSIDE PARK	ADAM'S APPLE in Cliffside Park is one of the many unpretentious corner bars lining Palisades Avenue, the kind one assumes is just another neighborhood lounge. Yet, in the rear of this particular establishment is a small dining room. And behind that is a kitchen that produces some decent, if undistinguished, home-style Italian dishes. Arranged along the shingled walls of the restaurant are a number of genuine oil paintings, some depicting pastoral scenes, others displaying a good deal of florid feminine flesh. Another eye-catcher is the large glass tank behind the bar; it contains three enormous, almost sinister-looking tropical fish.
1981-12-20	Dining Out; HIGGINS: A MAINSTAY OF RAWAYTON	ROWAYTON HIGGINS Restaurant has long been a mainstay on the Rowayton scene. Now, reopened since a fire, it has a somewhat different interior. The nautical theme is intact, with a big ship's wheel inside the entrance, and rope riggings used effectively as room separators. The bar is now in the room to the right as you enter, the dining room to the left. The brick-walled dining room seems more welcoming than in the past, with greater spacing between tables and with well-separated partitions of brick along one wall. Wooden tables are set with flickering candles in hurricane glass chimneys and tiny vases of chrysanthemums and sprigs of dried reeds. The effect is inviting, despite the use of paper placemats and napkins at dinner. Service is youthful and efficient.
1981-12-13	The Careful Shopper; Larger-Sized Values Offered in Hartsdale	''The other woman,'' the larger one, is being catered to by designers and major manufacturers despite a common presumption that most colorful, well-made clothing ends with size 12 or 13. The Other Woman, a Hartsdale Plaza shop, has everything discounted and is a hybrid, sharing a roof with Tall Girls Haven, not an off-price store. Each, however, has a nearly storewide 25 percent discount ending today with all sales final. Coat and dress sizes are 14 1/2 to 26 1/2; the sportswear is 36 to 46 and pants are in sizes 30 to 44, and to size 46 in some styles. There is a sale of up to 50 percent off at The Other Woman on blazers, suits and coats. A well-advertised Harve Benard collarless gray jacket, marketed at $230 and usually $210.99 here, now sells for $149. A brown tweed suit by Stuart Fashions, $162 elsewhere and $149 here, is down to $119; Lady Copley white wool blazers, once $94, are $47 and matching fully lined straight skirts with magic-fit waistbands, once $52, are $25. An MPM Originals short black wool jacket with black velvet collar and pocket trim is now $99.
1981-12-13	Dining Out; THREE-STAR DINING IN GRANITE SPRINGS	ASUCCESS story is always satisfying, and there is none so dramatic as Damiano's in Granite Springs. From unimpressive beginnings, this restaurant has over the last two years developed a well-disciplined northern Italian kitchen that produces dishes of remarkable dependability. Such constancy deserves particular admiration in light of the pressures brought about by the restaurant's increased popularity. Marie Damiano, the owner, has put a polish to the dining rooms not only in the softly glowing brass accent of candlesticks, fire screen and dazzling espresso machine, but also in the crispness and sparkle of the table appointments. Polished, too, is professional interplay between the kitchen's creative chef, Nicola Brunetti, and the knowledgeable maitre d'hotel, Marcello Sili. Mr. Sili, quick with the personal touch, knows the kitchen and will suggest the best dishes of the evening and appropriate wines from the cellar's wide and interesting range. In order to take advantage of the seasonal market and thus to offer daily specials, Damiano's has trimmed its menu; but, as always, if the kitchen has the ingredients and is not too busy, it will be pleased to prepare special requests. Mr. Brunetti's light, traditional technique manifests itself in beautifully presented dishes. His balanced arrangements, innocent of kiwi fruit or grapes or strange sorbets, owe something to nouvelle cuisine yet exhibit welcome restraint.
1981-12-06	The Careful Shopper; Shoe Bazaar Offers More Than Footwear	The Shoe Bazaar opened in 1968 in Briarcliff Manor and three years ago in Hartsdale Plaza on South Central Avenue. And there are Connecticut shops in Norwalk and in Stamford. The discount policy is 15 percent to 20 percent off list or department store advertised prices, and during this month's semiannual clearance footwear and handbags that are marked with red dots are further reduced, some by as much as 50 percent. The shoe sizes are mostly 5 1/2 to 10, with some size 5s; there are a few wides, but most are medium or narrow; and special orders from other branches are possible. Fashionable metallic-finished leather pumps are $42; strappy Funny Girl sandals with a very high, slim heel are at $25.90, down from $41; Beene Bag bronze or pewter low, closed pumps are at $59.99, and dressy sandals of gold or bronze cost $49.99. For shopping bag addicts, a golden version by Sable, originally $17 at some stores and $13.99 here, is down to $7.90. Comparison shoppers may scan a handy bulletin board of advertisements - one Halston handbag, $165 elsewhere, sells at $132.99 here; an embossed leather shoe at $56 sells for $39.90; a Frye boot, elsewhere $119, dips to $104.99, and boot trees, otherwise $6, sell for $4.99.
1981-12-06	Dining Out; A DISAPPOINTMENT IN JERSEY CITY	IT'S UNFORTUNATE that musical groups find it necessary to use amplifiers to increase the sound to a decibel level that is surely harmful to anyone constantly exposed to it. No where is this more unpleasant or more out of place than in a restaurant. During one of our visits to Giordano's Villa Capri Ristorante in Jersey City, we were asked to wait in the tiny, modern upstairs bar for 45 minutes (even though we had reservations). However, the duo playing in the corner of the bar made so much noise that it was impossible to hear someone even if he (or she) shouted.
1981-12-06	Dining Out; A CHINESE CONTENDER ON THE BLOCK	THE county's newest restaurant to offer Chinese cuisine has joined the renowned cluster along lower Central Avenue. Any newcomer had best know what it is about, and New Garden in Yonkers, the young contender, clearly does. This restaurant is a surprisingly welcome addition to the well-established finest in Westchester, offering much that is new in Chinese cuisine. The owner and chef, ony Yee, brings to Westchester a menu studded with singular dishes perfected at Manhattan's Shun Lee Palace. Suede in neutral tones lines the rooms, punctuated with bright greenery. Separate dining areas work in and around a central diamond, a comfortable arrangement providing a quiet atmosphere, a sense of privacy and calm.
1981-11-29	Dining Out; A BOOKSTORE WITH EXCELLENT PATE	NEW HAVEN ''MEET me at the bookstore for lunch'' may sound like an odd suggestion - but not in New Haven. One of the city's newest and better places for a quick, but not fast-food, lunch, or morning, afternoon or late-night snack, is located in the middle of the Atticus Bookstore, on Chapel Street near the Yale Repertory Theater. The Atticus Bookstore Cafe is new to New Haven, but the caterer supplying most of the food, named The Kitchen, has been in business on Crown Street for some time. The Cafe is really just seven tables and a few barstools. It seats a total of 36 at a time, clustered near a wood counter or bar and blue-tile work station that is in the middle of the bookstore.
1981-11-29	Dining Out; CONTINENTAL FARE WITH PRETENSIONS	AT Encore, the dining room of the Sheraton Smithtown, no cliche of fancy dining has been overlooked. The garnishes on the plates and platters, the tableside preparations, the dessert cart, the wine service and the dining room hierarchy are characteristic of the abundant superficial gloss. But the evidence of quality ingredients prepared with care and good taste is frequently lacking. The menu is Continental. Among the appetizers are snails in mushroom caps - a dish that can be delicious when the mushrooms are not rubbery canned ones heated in a pool of bland, oily sauce with a fairly dried-out, tasteless snail in each, as they are here. Baked clams casino are made with a damp, bready stuffing and are not casino style. Shrimp stuffed with crabmeat also involved more bread than seafood. The shrimp are fried, then draped with a congealed hollandaise type of sauce, and, just in case that is not enough, there is remoulade sauce on the side.
1981-11-29	Dining Out; WHEN SERVICE IS	TOO ATTENTIVE By ANNE SEMMES THREE months ago, the owners of the Golden Steer, a popular steak house on the outskirts of Hawthorne, fixed up the old house next door and opened another restaurant called A Little Touch of Country. While still serving hearty, straightforward fare -steaks, chops, lobsters and the like - the annex is aimed at a more affluent clientele than its neighbor, both in ambiance and, to a lesser degree, in price. The bar and two dining areas are done up in vaguely Colonial fashion. Dark-wood floors, pewter service plates and goblets and hurricane lamps on the calico-covered tables make for a cozy, yet unpretentious, setting.
1981-11-29	Dining Out; INDIAN SPOT WORTH LOOKING INTO	WHILE not exactly the culinary melting pot that is Manhattan, Westchester supports and cherishes restaurants that offer good examples of diverse cuisines. Diners seeking the rich and strange take particular note when a new restaurant offering Indian cooking opens its door, and Abhilash in New Rochelle has now had its door open for four months. Perhaps because it is so new, Abhilash lacks the breathtakingly exotic wrappings of the other two Indian restaurants in the county. The decor seems incomplete and rather stark below the brilliantly quilted ceiling: walls are uncommittedly bare, lighting frustratingly dim. We would like to be able to greet this new arrival without qualification; but, on our visits, the kitchen reflected the atomosphere. The food for the most part, was noncommittal, feebly flavored - a dim rendition of a sunny cuisine.
1981-11-27	2 French choices, modern and funky.	ONE of the most original and inviting new restaurants to open in New York in quite a while is Delices La Cote Basque at Olympic Tower, the handsome black glass building on Fifth Avenue with a thoroughfare lobby running from 51st to 52d Street. A modern version of the covered-street concept that inspired Milan's Galleria, the Olympic Tower setting is enhanced by a monumental waterfall and tall boxed trees. On the street level, Delices operates a retail pastry shop, a convivial bar and Le Cafe, a terrace area with bright tablecloths and an attractive menu offering breakfast, light lunches and snacks. Downstairs it operates La Cascade, a full-fledged restaurant that looks out on the waterfall and that offers lunch, tea and dinner in a bright and comfortable modern setting. No longer connected with La Cote Basque, the French restaurant on 55th Street, Delices La Cote Basque is a patisserie and cafe on Lexington Avenue whose management also operates at Olympic Tower. Guy Pascal, the master pastry chef and guiding light behind the Delices ventures, and his chef, Xavier Leroux, have worked out excellent menus for both the cafe and the restaurant. What they have yet to work out is a pattern for smooth operation.
1981-11-22	Dining Out; NORTHERN ITALIAN FARE WITH STYLE	LA PRIMAVERA in East Hills has weathered the test of time extremely well. Shortly after it opened a couple of years ago, there was every indication that it would be among the best northern Italian restaurants on the Island. It still is, even though the rating has now been revised from three stars to two. Although the food can be astonishingly good, recent dining experiences have proved less consistently excellent than in the past. The long, rectangular dining room is decorated in a rather jarring interpretation of high style with padded maroon wet-look vinyl covering the walls halfway up, topped by an uncoordinated array of bright paintings, some too large for the spaces assigned them. The lighting - provided by spotlights on the paintings, an awkward fantrimmed chandelier and plain round fixtures more suitable for hotel hallways - remains uneven, but the illumination level has been raised so that some tables are no longer suffused in gloom.
1981-11-22	IN HARTSDALE, 3 STARS FOR FRENCH CUISINE	FEW restaurants in the county offer fine classic French cuisine, and even the best of these occasionally falter in a world where all is flux. Reputations of restaurants follow paths that swoop and soar according to changes in ownership, kitchen personnel, dining room staff and, not insignificantly, the economy. It is gratifying then to see Auberge Argenteuil in Hartsdale thrive under the new sole ownership of Henri and M'el Eudes. The menu streamlined, dining room staff efficient, dining rooms refurbished, thoroughly professional kitchen orchestrated by its longtime chef de cuisine, Francois Kerohas, together with Mrs. Eudes's gracious warmth and Mr. Eudes's felicitous attentiveness as he suggests special dishes and appropriate wines from his cellar - that old magic is there again. Right now Auberge Argenteuil is one of our favorite dining places this side of the Atlantic. Among the many fine dishes the kitchen sends forth, soups proved exceptional. Once poorly balanced and overly salted, the harmonious concoctions provided an auspicious beginning to the meal, whether one chose lobster bisque, a jot too intense with saffron but nevertheless intoxicatingly rich and heavy with magenta crustaceans, or one of the daily soups: glowing vegetables in a cheerful, transparent broth; St.-Germain, the soothing pureed pea soup adrift with homemade croutons; subtle fish soup edged with Gruyere shavings; pungent watercress soup cream-smoothed.
1981-11-22	The Careful Shopper; Tasty Holiday Gifts: Cheeses and Nuts	The English send ''tuck boxes'' of sweets to allay loneliness as well as hunger at boarding schools; devoted families here depend more often on home-baked cookies or cakes, aware that apple pie may not survive the journey to students staying away for the holidays. For additional choices, and to save time in the kitchen, try a visit to Cheese 'n' Such in the Heathcote section of Scarsdale at the border with New Rochelle. There, free wooden lids, or fancier baskets at various prices, can be custom-filled, gift-wrapped, packed free and shipped postpaid. New York State cheddar cheese at $4.59 a pound travels well and can adorn apple pie at the receiving end; Vermont gems, the pale cheddar in black wax, can be had by the wedge for the same price as the New York cheese or be bought whole for $11.95; and Norwegian Jarlsberg can be bought at $3.59 a pound. French Brie at $4.99 a pound, a soft cheese that survives re-shipping well, is also popular.
1981-11-22	Dining Out; QUALITY AND OLD-TIME VERITIES	PUTNAM WELCOME to the pre-additive 1930's or 40's. Welcome to My Kitchen, a tiny restaurant in the northeastern tip of Connecticut. My Kitchen has a homey name and an attractive mix of down-home accouterments, such as an arrangement of black skillets hung along the brick fireplace wall and big black kettles of soup being kept warm on top of the old-fashioned stove. Fresh flowers on each table rest in oldfashioned pint milk bottles. Framed Norman Rockwell Saturday Evening Post covers hang along the walls, and in the bathrooms you'll find 1938, 1941 and 1948 copies of Life, Look and the Post. The small staff of young waiters and waitresses has an eager-toplease earnestness that befits the look of this small place that seats 40.
1981-11-21	CITY SEEKING TO STEM EXODUS OF 'BACK OFFICE' JOBS	Business and public leaders are warning that New York City may be losing its ''back office'' jobs as soaring office rents in Manhattan, together with advancing technology and the use of computers, lessen the need for office workers to be in the same place as their executives. They note that many banks, insurance companies and securities dealers still have long-term office leases at $10 to $12 a square foot a year that could rise to $30 or $35 in lease renewals or new construction. The Real Estate Board of New York says the danger is that the offices market will become ''stratified,'' with company headquarters in Manhattan and back-office operations seeking cheaper space elsewhere. Space might be obtained at $20 a square foot in New Jersey and nearby New York State suburbs for such work as accounting, billing and check processing. Karen N. Gerard, Deputy Mayor for Economic Policy and Development, said the city's ''very recent success in expanding office functions'' had resulted in ''very low'' vacancies and high rentals.
1981-11-20	Restaurants; Palace revisited; new in midtown.	EVER since it opened in 1975, the Palace on East 59th Street, across from the Queensboro Bridge, has been known as the city's most expensive restaurant. Renamed Michel Fitoussi's Palace last month, when the chef of the last five years also became the proprietor, the restaurant now has several rivals in its reduced price range. But four meals eaten there since Mr. Fitoussi took over the management several months ago indicate that it is still a one-star value. Inevitably, when discussing the Palace, price comes before food, a situation that has existed since it opened. Previously, there were dinners for $150, $95 and $70, a confusing arrangement because each dinner had a different number of courses and unless everyone at the table chose the same format, service was awkward. That plan has been sensibly simplified. Now there is a single dinner at $70 that includes a choice of appetizers, soup or a minuscule serving of pasta, then a fish or meat main course, a salad, dessert and coffee. There are also many dishes that carry surcharges. Although no other restaurant in New York has so expensive a price-fixed meal, it is certainly possible to spend $70 for food alone at several first-class French restaurants. But in most of those restaurants, the diner receives far more value, both in variety and skillful preparation.
1981-11-17	Chemical Bank Has Gold Card	The Chemical Bank will begin marketing a new, ''upscale'' MasterCard later this week, according to Wilbert Primosch, vice president. Between 500,000 and 600,000 applications will be mailed to individuals throughout the Northeast with about 350,000 being sent to homes in New York and New Jersey.
1981-11-16	'SILENCE' MOTIVE IS BEING STUDIED IN THREE DEATHS	City detectives said yesterday that they were looking into the possibility that a Brooklyn woman was slain, along with her son and nephew, to keep her or her husband from cooperating in government investigations. The woman, 34-year-old Anna Chester, was shot to death Friday night in the house where she and her husband, Leonard, had operated a scheme in which corrupt merchants sent in phony credit slips for collection, according to investigators. Also slain were Mrs. Chester's 8-year-old son, Shye, and her nephew, Ronnie Goldschmidt, 23.
1981-11-15	Dining Out; ECLECTICISM AMID VICTORIAN CHIC	HANDSOME is as handsome does, and so it is especially gratifying to find that The Brownstone Cafe in Mount Kisco has at last a kitchen worthy of its stylish decor. From the anteroom's crewel couch and Oriental runner to the dining area's wicker screens and pretty hanging lamps, the long, narrow restaurant has renovation-Victorian chic. Arabesques of oak grain soften the railroad-style room arrangement: the wood crosses walls, frames windows and mirrors, lines up in vertical louvers and blossoms into highly polished tables. From its eclectic new menu, The Brownstone Cafe offers diners some interesting and effective dishes. Although we had to wait an unconscionably long time for menus one evening, even after requesting them, the immediately presented warmed bread and attractively cut drudites reassured us, and the long-awaited appetizers' general success eased any residual annoyance. The kitchen brought bold confidence to dishes that demanded it - bracing, meaty chili topped with corsely chopped onions; obvious but raffishly spicy sausage and cheese in filo - without affronting those requiring a shier approach - cream of broccoli soup youthfully green in flavor; soothing fried mozzarella sitting crisp and pretty atop lettuce leafs.
1981-11-15	TEACHING HOW TO SOLICIT GIFTS	HILLSDALE ''IAM the most knowledgeable person in church funding in the world,'' says Dr. Raymond B. Knudsen, a Presbyterian pastor and president of a nonprofit corporation called National Consultations on Financial Development. The company's sole function is to advise churches and synagogues on how to be more effective in getting money from their members. Dr. Knudsen crosses the country several times each week, advising individual congregations and seminaries, or holding seminars in hotels, as he spreads the word that deferred gift-giving is passe and cash-only bequests are severely limiting to both giver and receiver. One of Dr. Knudsen's biggest clients, Drew University of Madison, recently hired him to conduct 26 seminars in the next year on gift annuities, church financing and personal estate planning. The seminars will be held from New England through Delaware, and clergymen and lay personnel who attend will take back to their congregations what they learn and apply this to fund-raising efforts.
1981-11-08	Dining Out; COMBINING JAPAN'S OLD AND NEW	SUMA of Tokyo, recently installed in Great Neck, offers a menu that should please novices as well as those who are familiar with Japanese food. It combines the showy hibachi grill dinners with traditional Japanese dishes. And unlike some of the hibachi-style restaurants that have added more authentic specialties, diners are not segregated according to their level of sophistication with the traditional food available in only one section. At Suma of Tokyo, it is possible to order from both sides of the menu at the same table. The traditional food is superior to the hibachi dinner combinations, but the restaurant's management apparently does not feel ready to make a total commitment. It seems as though it has retained the option, however, since the hibachi grill is a counter, situated where one might normally expect to find the sushi bar. Most of the tables in this pleasant, comfortable but simply decorated restaurant are some distance from the grill, and all eyes are not on the hibachi chefs.
1981-11-01	36th Election Day Fair Shapes Up in Scarsdale	A tradition for 35 years, the Scarsdale Congregational Church Election Day Fair draws crowds from well beyond the village. Some business people come regularly for the corn chowder, turkey salad, sandwiches, lasagne, hot dogs, cake or pie and go back to work after lunch is served between 11:30 A.M. and 1 P.M. in Dyckman Hall of the Parish House. Many more, however, arrive well before 9:30 A.M. to spend the day filling their trucks and cars with antiques, art, fabrics remnants, furniture, clothing, white and pink elephants, jewelry, plants, Christmas decorations, toys, games and sports equipment. There are also home-baked cakes, cookies and candies and hand-knitted hats, sweaters and mittens. The ''Sunday Dinner Cookbook'' at $2 suggests variations in putting one-pot meals on the stove before leaving for church so that the midday meal is ready on returning.
1981-11-01	Dining Out; SETTING A NEW HIGH, ITALIAN STYLE	NEW HAVEN IN looks alone, L'Avventura sets new standards for Italian restaurants in New Haven; in fact, perhaps for the entire state. Located in an old brick building on the corner of Elm and State Streets, the premises once served as a drugstore and most recently as another restaurant, Curious Jane's. But L'Avventura has changed more than the decor. The entire configuration is different and stunning. Inside the corner entrance is a wraparound bar, surrounded by informal tables for soups, sandwiches, light snacks and late-night cafe offerings. Through a short corridor is the restaurant itself. For the full effect, though, you should come in through the main Elm Street entrance. Cloth banners, in alternating beige and pale bluegreen, cut a swath overhead like a series of arches through the small main dining room. Attractive but unobtrusive Art Deco pictures are displayed along the white brick walls. The lighting is subdued and romantic but not dim.
1981-11-01	FRESH SEAFOOD IN BEFITTING SETTING	FRESH seafood is the stock in trade at Sam's Restaurant in Rockville Centre. This small, stylishly attractive marine blue restaurant is connected to the fish market of the same name next door. Fish made of fluorescent lights cast a welcoming glow in the window. Shortly after it opened several years ago, the food at Sam's, from the simplest broiled fillet to the more complicated dishes, proved to be consistently well-prepared. Now, after a few recent visits, the broiled fish still delights, but some of the other specialties listed on the menu were disappointing.
1981-11-01	Dining Out; IT MAY BE AN EVENING OUT, BUT--	RESTAURANTS serve many purposes. Some people go to them to sample special, or at least well-prepared, dishes that they might not prepare at home. Others choose to dine out because they are feeling festive and want to be pampered by a well-trained staff in an attractive atmosphere. Another group of diners simply wants to have an evening out without spending an arm and a leg. Of the three groups, the last-named would be tempted the most by the Hickory Tree Inn in Chatham. For although there is little to recommend in the way of fine dining, a few of the dishes are decent enough, the portions are large and the prices are fairly moderate.
1981-11-01	ENTREES THAT CAN FUEL THE APPETITE	ALTHOUGH the price of fuel has made the casual Sunday afternoon drive almost extinct except, perhaps, for the ritual excursion to preview autumn foliage before it dazzles Our Town, Westchester residents still travel north throughout the year to deposit offspring at colleges, to hear music, to ski mountains, to scout fairs. If circumstances take the traveler to the Poughkeepsie area and dictate a very good, leisurely dinner, Le Pavillon, five minutes north off Routes 44/ 55, is a restaurant well worth remembering. Open not quite a year, Le Pavillon is owned by Eleanor and Claude Guermont, the chef and a former teacher at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park. The short but select menu is enticingly uncliched yet comforting and familiar. (English translations accompany French entries). Special dishes offered almost every evening take advantage of the season's bounty not only of fresh produce but also of game and fish. Many dishes merited a lavish three-star rating, as did one of our meals there on an evening when the dining room was only half full, but on a bustling Saturday night, a few offerings fell short of expectation.
1981-10-30	Two new links in a Szechuan empire.	TO understand what is going on here, it is necessary to have a few names clearly fixed in mind. Empire Szechuan Gourmet, the grandaddy of this Empire restaurant group, is at 2574 Broadway, at 97th Street on the Upper West Side. Two years ago, it received a one-star rating. A few months ago, Empire Szechuan Columbus opened at 193 Columbus Avenue, between 68th and 69th Street. Shortly after, came the Empire Szechuan Balcony at 381 Third Avenue (between 27th and 28th Street). The chain grows again in a few weeks when the same management opens Empire Szechuan Bleecker in Greenwich Village. Before the paint is dry on the walls of the two newest restaurants, their windows were displaying the review of the original Empire Szechuan Gourmet, sometimes with the date and address, other times without, and a huge blow-up was mounted in the window of the Bleecker Street newcomer at least two months ago, even before construction began.
1981-10-25	Dining Out; CHINESE FARE THAT'S MULTIREGIONAL	HUNAN PALACE is the latest tenant at a location in Huntington that has been occupied by a series of Chinese restaurants. The quality of a restaurant does not seem to be the major factor in determining changes in management or chefs. Such shifting around, accompanied by announcements of yet another ''grand opening,'' seems to be characteristic of the Chinese restaurant business. Hunan Palace is a decent restaurant, although less distinguished than some of its predecessors. The preparation is competent. In keeping with the current Chinese restaurant trend, the menu is multiregional, presenting specialties that reflect Hunan, Sichuan and Cantonese cooking, as well as mandarin styles and the cooking of Peking. Chinese-American dishes, once the mainstay of Chinese restaurants, have been mostly shunted to the back page. Despite the fact that one collection of cliches such as chicken chow mein and moo goo gai pan have been replaced by another that includes moo shu pork, Lake Tung Ting shrimp and General Tso's chicken, there is a far greater variety of flavors and preparations offered these days.
1981-10-25	FRENCH CUISINE COOKED TO ORDER	RIDGEFIELD ENTREZ VOUS is a tiny restaurant in a wood-frame shopping complex on a side street in Ridgefield. At first glance, the interior looks like a modest soup-and-quiche eatery. There are tables for 22 in the small dining area, and tables for 18 more on the glassed-in porch. In the rear of the dining area are refrigerated display cases, where some of the day's offerings are visible. But the menu quickly dispels any tendency to underestimate the capacities of Entrez Vous and its chef-owner, Joseph Coates, whose previous culinary habitat includes The Inn in Ridgefield and The Palace in New York. There are just eight appetizers and 10 entrees, all listed in French, along with two or three daily specials.
1981-10-18	Dining Out; FROM VAST MENU, GREEK IS CHOICE	TO enjoy a dinner at Aphrodite in White Plains, one would do well to be partial to Greek food and indifferent to conversation. The large dining areas of this restaurant are usually crowded with guests who come to take advantage of what the management calls ''diner prices'' and to dance, and sometimes sing, to the live music competing with the voices. Spirits soar as high as the noise level - a small party celebrating an anniversary at one table, bosses dining their secretaries at another, entire families at yet others. Amused by the dining room bustle, all take for granted the unstinting portions the kitchen doles. The distraction is welcome, however, for some of the food cannot bear close scrutiny. Refurbished and reopened since last May, Aphrodite offers a dismayingly extensive menu, much of it from the limbo of ''continental'' cuisine. One need not consult the oracle to know that any restaurant kitchen would be hard put to make a success of every item on such a menu. And it is a pity that those who crave Greek cooking will find only a scant representation of that cuisine here, for it is the Greek dishes listed that proved most interesting and most accomplished.
1981-10-18	The Careful Shopper; by Jeanne Clare Feron; Quick Service Offered At Eyeglass Center	Optical Insight at the White Plains Mall has an optometrist, an optician and a laboratory on the premises. The half-hour examination costs $12, including an eye health and glaucoma test. Glass lenses begin at $18 and plastic lenses start at $20, which are available the same day, although bifocals and trifocals take longer to prepare and cost more. Basic plastic frames begin at $7.95, with Gloria Vanderbilt No. 19 at $29, Zimco SST Nilor frames at $36.95 and Yves St. Laurent No. 16 at $19.95. For YSL No. 65, Oleg Cassini and Bill Blass No. 34 or No. 6 the frame charge is $24.95. Wider lenses and varying shapes, naturally, also affect these prices, and corporate, civil service and union arrangements mean special discounts. The senior discount is 15 percent.
1981-10-18	Dining Out; IF IT HAD KEPT TO GERMAN CUISINE...	WITH a name like the Jolly Swagman, there is no question that this restaurant in Hicksville is Australian. Less obviously, it is also German. A good measure of Continental cooking is also included. Of the cuisines it offers, the German is the most successful. In fact, if the kitchen concentrated on only German cooking, eliminating the Australian dishes (or substantially improving them), the restaurant would clearly deserve one star. The restaurant, in a house, is white stucco with dogwood used for wainscoting, booths, ceiling beams, ornamental railings and the bar. What isn't dark wood is dark brown leatherette. That includes the tablecloths, a singular off note in a decorating scheme that is clubby and handsomely attractive. In the center of the room is a large bar that seems to do an extremely good business. The varied assortment of domestic and imported beers on tap may be a factor. But the cocktails made with lollipop-sweet fruit juices are less appealing.
1981-10-12	VISA'S MOVE WORRIES GERMAN BANKS	West German banks are regrouping to fend off a wave of American-style credit cards after a marketing coup by the last of the big consumer cards to penetrate this closely guarded market. Major American credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard have been spreading across Europe in recent years. But German banks have been able to keep such cards out of their domestic market by refusing them sponsors and by throwing their considerable weight behind a powerful competitor - the Eurocheque network. In August, however, Visa International and the BankAmerica Corporation's West German branch announced an agreement with Bayerische Motoren Werke, the auto maker, to issue Visa credit cards, linked to BankAmerica acounts, through BMW's list of German dealers.
1981-10-11	Careful Shopper; Elmsford Warehouse A Weekend Store	The word is out among shoppers: an Elmsford warehouse devoted to wholesale shipping during the week turns into The Factory Warehouse Store each weekend and offers 30 to 50 percent discounts on junior and misses' nationally advertised sportswear, a few men's trousers (at $19.99) and children's jeans, corduroys and skirts. This weekend will be extended for Columbus Day shoppers - the hours are 8 A.M. until 5 P.M. Monday. A recent advertised special was women's Levi's ''bendover pant'' in eight colors, selling for $12.99 instead of the usual $26. The racks include blouses and sweaters and some polyfill vests, with corduroy coats and outerwear due to be in stock as the weather cools. The owners have their own sportswear factories plus retail outlets on Long Island; they are opening a warehouse for retail sales in Texas, and Connecticut and New Jersey outlets are planned. There are three dressing rooms for men and one large one for women, with a limit of 10 garments at one time. Sizes are 6 through 18 and 7 through 14 for children and the few seconds are clearly marked.
1981-10-11	TEMPTING FARE IN A STEAKHOUSE	AL STEINER'S, a fixture in Cedarhurst across from the railroad station for the last 20 years, changed management this year. Since this is the first time it is being reviewed, comparisons with the past cannot be made. But as it is, it seems to be doing a commendable job. The menu presents a basic steakhouse format, with some embellishments and digressions into Continental cooking. As might be expected, the simple grilled dishes are preferable to the few attempts at elaborate preparations. The restaurant is bright and attractive, shingled inside and out. The servers are extremely professional, mostly old-timers whose friendly and accommodating courtesy makes dining a pleasure.
1981-10-11	Dining Out; TAKING SOME SOLID FIRST STEPS	IN the middle of busy Mamaroneck, Enzo's restaurant has for three months occupied the corner that once held Rimini Riviera. Completely remodeled, Enzo's pretty, semiformal dining room offers a seriously Italian menu of the northern persuasion, but the kitchen seems as young as the restaurant, unused to grave matters, and has still to find itself. On the whole, the food is pleasant, fresh, but undistinguished. Conspicuous care seems to be taken in order not to offend the tastes of all diners; thus the kitchen errs mostly through omission rather than commission, and the culinary efforts tend to the jejune. However, Enzo's, still in its fledgling stage, has definite possibilities - and character develops with growth. Dishes list ed on the blackboard menu deserve consideration; quite afew successes appeared here. Enzo's offered so many pasta dishes that they app eared to be a specialty, raising diners' hopes above wisdom, becau se the timid hand in the kitchen could not, for the most part, gi ve the pastas their distinctive due.
1981-10-11	Dining Out; A MERGER OF QUANTITY AND QUALITY	RESTAURANTS are frequently recommended on the basis of the quantity of food served. Unfortunately, quantity and quality are not usually synonomous. Thus , it's all the more pleasant to come across a restaurant li ke Francesco's in Passaic; here, the portions are large, but th e quality of the basic ingredients is good and, for the most part, th e food is carefully prepared. The 10-year-old restaurant, owned by the Vendola family, changed location 18 months ago. The new premises, practically next door to the old, are bright and cheerful, and the customers are eminently watchable. The last point is of interest only because the restaurant does not accept reservations for dinner, and on weekends one can easily wait two hours for a table.
1981-10-09	Restaurants; Russian fare near Lincoln Center.	BECAUSE Russian food seems especially appropriate before or after concerts and the ballet, it seems equally appropriate to have it represented near Lincoln Center. Opened about two months ago on 62d Street, Tovarisch is already good enough to indicate that with time and practice it may become even better. This snug restaurant is divided into two rooms, and though the front dining room is livelier, both have a warm and festive glow. The warmth is created by a combination of an orange paisley fabric on the wall, mirrors with colorful lacquer frames, pretty flowers and candlelight. Slightly cramped tables and banal background music (much like the ''Volga Boatmen'' as rendered by Mantovani) detract somewhat from the overall experience. So do the slow service, the occasionally overbearing staff and food that is not always hot.
1981-10-04	Dining Out; ELEGANCE IN ITALIAN-FRENCH CUISINE	LA PACE in Glen Cove offers one of the more elegantly beautiful settings for dining on the Island. A polished copper doorway opens into the bar area with dark green walls, bare floors and brick archways leading to the dining room. The bar is spacious enough to accommodate the crowds waiting for tables on weekends. The dining room is large, with a lofty ceiling and handsome fireplace. The walls are upholstered in green and gold chevronpatterned fabric, the chairs are comfortable burgundy plush and the soft but not dim lighting is perfect for dining. Conversations can be heard, but do not carry from one well-spaced table to the next.
1981-10-04	Dining Out; OKTOBERFEST FROM AN OLD CELEBRANT	OF all festivals, the jolliest, to our mind, is the celebration of autumn's harvest. The rite is at once a tribute to the fertile spirits of earth and sun for the year's crop and an appeal for future abundance. The grain harvested bears bread and beer and a moment of leisure to enjoy the bacchanal. It has been noted that myth changes while custom remains constant, and so the Bavarian version of the October festival is now being commemorated at most restaurants in the county that offer German specialties. The oldest of these restaurants, Maxl's, presents as gemutlich an environment as one would hope to find outside Munich. Approach Maxl's Oktoberfest in the right spirit and enjoy the guileless entertainment, the paper decorations and the Bavarian costumes of the dining room staff. Corny, yes. But open-hearted. It's fun to go with a group: a large table nearby held four generations of celebrants.
1981-10-04	Dining Out; 2 THAT WON'T STRAIN THE BUDGET	''ISN'T there any place a family with kids can go for dinner without taking out a bank loan?'' That's a question frequently asked of this column, and one ''yes'' answer may be found at Post Corner Pizza in Darien. Another is Pickles in Ridgefield. Post Corner Pizza is a small, ''no frills'' restaurant. Don't let the name deter you. This isn't just a pizza parlor. It is Greekowned, and in addition to a great variety of Greek-style pizzas has a few Greek specialties of interest as well.
1981-10-04	The Careful Shopper; Additional Discounts At Childrenswear	The expansion of Childrenswear House will be celebrated all this week at both the Eastchester Mall outlet, which was established two years ago, and at the new Loehmann's Plaza store in White Plains, which opened yesterday. The usual discount is between 20 and 30 percent on first quality, fashionable children's clothing, all with the manufacturer's guarantee. During the celebration, there will be additional reductions of 10 to 30 percent in prices for many items. Sizes run from infant to 14 for girls and up to 20 for boys.
1981-10-04	Dining Out; THE JAPANESE INFLUENCE IN BERGEN	ALARGE community of Japanese businessmen and their families have settled in Fort Lee and with them, fortunately for the rest of us, have come a number of Japanese restaurants. Sushi bars are becoming almost as common as fast-food spots in this Bergen County community. One of the better Japanese restaurants is Honda. It is named for its owner, Kunioki Honda, who is, as he put it, regrettably unrelated to the car of the same name.
1981-09-27	Dining Out; QUALITY IN GREEK REVIVAL MANSION	THOSE who have been familiar with the Bridgehampton area over the past decade and have followed the decline of the Bulls Head Inn from popular nightspot to near ruin must now be cheered by its splendid restoration. Although work on the upper stories continues, three dining rooms and the bar on the main floor opened in August. An air of gracious restraint prevails in the highceilinged dining rooms, each small enough to provide a sense of cozy intimacy. Lighting, at first too dim, is now warmly subdued. The 1843 Greek Revival mansion has been gutted and all the woodwork and trim remov edfor stripping, repair and waxing. It is now restored and the effect is handsome.
1981-09-27	Dining Out; INTRIGUING FARE, RIVER VIEW	GAYLORDSVILLE FRITZ & FOX, a restaurant on Route 7, north of New Milford, might more appropriately be named Fox & Fox. The Fritz of the partnership has now gone, and James Fox and his wife, Eileen, are running the three-year-old establishment by themselves. He does the cooking; she is as maitre d'hotel and manager. It is an unusually attractive restaurant. The two-story building, which utilizes weathered wood from an old barn in the vicinity, has a prime location overlooking the Housatonic River. From the large rear windows of the upstairs - or loft - dining room, diners have an unparalleled view of woods and water.
1981-09-27	Dining Out; COMING UP SHORT IN LONG VALLEY	RESTAURANTS can be chameleonic in their ability to change from one visit to the next. New restaurants are particularly prone to this inconsistency, which is why we usually allow time for a new establishment to settle down before it is reviewed. Unfortunately, some take longer than others to hit their stride. The Cafe Proven,cal in the Morris County community of Long Valley is a case in point. Four months ago, Todd Fial, the chef-owner, brought continental food to premises that were formerly occupied by a Vietnamese restaurant. But, despite the fact that it is possible to enjoy a two-star meal here, both the kitchen and service are too inconsistent to give more than one star at the present time.
1981-09-25	Restaurants; Theater landmark, informal Asian.	ALTHOUGH it is never pleasant to have to reduce the rating of a restaurant, it is especially disturbing to have to do so with Gallagher's for three reasons. This restaurant was very good four years ago and well deserving of two stars. Now, however, a fair rating is the most it earns, the result of a decline in service and food that must be attributable to inept management. This convivial, lusty eating place on West 52d Street near Broadway, with its paneled walls, checkered tablecloths and photographs of sports, theater and political personalities, is one of the few real landmarks remaining in the Broadway area. Almost all of the food that makes up Gallagher's standard steakhouse menu is of superb quality, but unfortunately the ingredients are reduced to minimum acceptability by careless cooking and even more careless handling. What does it profit a restaurateur if he buys prime beef and then overcooks it or serves it barely tepid? If the shrimp are fresh and firm but were not deveined? And sparkling fresh clams and oysters are insufficiently chilled?
1981-09-22	VISA PLANS MONEY FUND AND HIGHER LIMIT CARD	Visa International said yesterday that it would offer a premium card with higher spending limits than its regular credit card to compete against the American Express gold card. In addition, Visa announced preliminary plans to make a money market fund available to its cardholders. ''These products are consistent with our goal to build a worldwide payment system,'' Dee Ward Hock, president of Visa, said in a telephone interview. Visa is the second company in recent months to enter the battle for the lucrative travel and expense market, which has traditionally been dominated by American Express. Mastercard International announced its premium card during the summer, and a spokesman said several banks had already signed up to offer the card.
1981-09-20	Dining Out; FRESH, APPEALING CHINESE TASTES	MANY of the newer Chinese restaurants in Fairfield County seem to be clones of one another. Even the menus look as though they were printed in the same place, with almost the same placement of items on the right and left sides, with the ''specialties'' in the center. Differences from one to the next often seem to be a matter of degree. The newest to open even bears a similar name to one of recent vintage. Hunan 95 is the name, and if you look closely while driving along I-95 from Darien to Stamford, you might see it just beyond the turnpike. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Stamford Motor Inn Motel. At the moment, while the weather is sufficiently warm and darkness is slow to descend, the glass windows that wrap around three sides of the dining room afford an overview which, unfortunately, is mostly of the Connecticut Turnpike access roads. Inside, hanging plants along the windows and a high ceiling painted as dark brown as the night sky create an indoor-outdoor feeling. As the weather gets colder, all those glass windows may be a bit chilly, but there is an inside dining room in the rear, beyond the bar.
1981-09-20	A SPOT FOR THOSE WITH AN APPETITE	THE few restaurants in the county that offer German specialties enjoy a predictable reputation for producing thumping portions of uncompromisingly flavored food at reasonable prices. They are homesaway-from-home for the voracious at mealtime. No exception, the Lakeside Restaurant in Yorktown Heights offers its bounty in modest yet tasteful surroundings: prints mixed unaffectedly with water colors, Berlin's Brandenburg Gate harmonized with a country bridge. Lacy white draperies, light wood paneling and a perfect wild rose on each table help complete a Mitteleuropean and weekend cottage blend. For the last year and a half under the new direction of Dieter Schramm, the kitchen has turned from Hungarian to German cooking. The menu, however, besides offering German specialties also lists conventional dishes.
1981-09-20	Cooking Supplies Blend With Some Lessons	The Chef's Source, a two-year-old store that changed ownership in June, is retaining its name, although probably more women than men will wander its aisles and participate in its weekday and evening classes at the Norma Myers Cooking School. The store offers a 10 percent discount to students on purchases made during each course. (This week's subjects are: hors d'oeuvres and canapes, gifts from the kitchen, a vegetarian feast and pasta perfect.) Gift certificates are available for both merchandise and courses. The shop's grand opening was celebrated last weekend with a candy and cookie tasting and a demonstration of cake decorating - the dahlias, daffodils, daisies and roses in frosting can be made in quantity and frozen. It was the first in a se ries of Saturday events that will explore such topics as the other us es of coffee, such as in desserts; Danish waffle-making; the versat ility of Romertopf clay bakers for main courses and desserts; and usi ng a food processor.
1981-09-13	Dining Out; ITALIAN FARE IN MEDITERRANEAN AURA	BRANFORD CLAUDIO'S, on the Green in Branford, offers something relatively rare in Connecticut: an Italian restaurant whose white-washed Mediterranean decor evokes images of Italy. The dining room at Claudio's is long and nar row, seating only 44, but a sense of greater spaciousness is sugges ted through the white walls, mirrors and graceful brass and glass c handeliers. Hanging plants and several pastel paintings contribut e to an understated, stylish restaurant. The food adds to the sense of style and good taste, though the menu itself, an imitation vellum scroll with a red cord tie, suggests a far more formal dining experience than Claudio's provides.
1981-09-13	Dining Out; WHERE DINERS ARRANGE THE MEAL	RENEE'S EATERY in Scarsdale is one of a growing number of places that have termed themselves ''eateries'' rather than restaurants. This new hybrid seems something more than a luncheonette and something less than a conventional restaurant, and the space is often shared with some other related enterprise, a bakery, a cheese shop, a fishmongery or, as in the case of Renee's, a small-scale delicatessen. Combining such food operations has its obvious advantages: it assures rapid turnover and is thus a natural way of having free ingredients always on hand. Although not all the dishes that Renee's Kitchen produced were successful, the failures did not lack refulgently fresh ingredients. The storefront dining area of Renee's Eatery is awkwardly L-shaped to accommodate a showcase of salads and desserts - the delicatessen section. The dining room is jammed with tables. Don't go there for conversation unless it is others you want to hear. But the sometimes head-ringing babble became less noticeable as the soothing special soups arrived, dill-perfumed, summery cucumber soup or full-stocked chicken, vegetable and ground veal. Less inspired were French onion soup, though rich nevertheless; weak and overly salted turkeyvegetable soup, an altogether unacceptable New England clam chowder, heavy with flour and the flavor of nutmeg.
1981-09-13	PROSPECTS quarter 1981-4th quarter 1982	Every Little Bit Helps In much the same way they treated his immediate predecessor, nervous financial markets have forced Ronald Reagan to reassess his budget proposals. However, it may not take much to placate investors. Allen Sinai of Data Resources says that if further cuts keep next year's deficit between $45 billion and $50 billion, they would have a calming effect on the credit markets. So too would an easing of the Federal Reserve's tough monetary policy, which in the past has always been relaxed in the face of slack economic conditions.
1981-09-13	Dining Out; A TEAM ENTERPRISE IN LAMBERTVILLE	A FEW years ago, restaurants like Cafe Renni in Lambertville were as rare as a pearl in an oyster. Now, however, small enterprises run by a husband-and-wife team, with one managing the dining room and the other the kitchen, are opening with increasing frequency. Ruth Christopher and her husband, Mark Carroza, opened Cafe Renni last February. Five months later, they had to move to larger premises on the same street.
1981-09-13	IF THE FOOD EQUALED THE WINE...	THE Carriage Pond Inne in Port Jefferson is one of the prettier restaurants in this area, and it boasts a brief but astonishingly sophisticated and reasonably priced wine list. So far so good. The cooking, however, does not measure up to the decor or the wines. The restaurant is in a large white clapboard building facing a public park and a parking lot in Port Jefferson, the heart of an area of recent and attractive restoration and refurbishing. A tiny pond remains in front of it and an open wagonlike vehicle stands on a patch of grass, which explains the name of the restaurant, but not its precious spelling. Inside, the walls are brick, punctuated with tall windows and deco rated with handsome woodwork, attractive prints and hunting a rtifacts.
1981-09-11	Restaurants; Two kinds of food good for the soul.	THE restaurants reviewed this week both offer friendly and cooperative service and well-prepared, diverting food at very moderate prices. The simple, hearty and savory dishes originating with poor blacks in the South is the most characteristic soul food served at Jack's Nest on Third Avenue between 23d and 24th Streets, where the menu includes fried chicken, smoked barbecued ribs, ham hocks, fried fish, chitterlings, corn bread, collard greens, black-eyed peas and yams, to name only a few of the classics. But at the six-month old Souen on the Avenue of the Americas at King Street, another sort of soul cooking is based on the macrobiotic principles laid down by George Ohsawa as a guide to both spiritual and physical harmony with nature. Macrobiotic cookery features grains, vegetables, and noodle and bean curd combinations cooked in the Japanese style. Some fish and occasional frying apparently are permitted for the less orthodox devotees.
1981-09-06	Dining Out; THE KITCHEN COULD USE SOME HELP	THE Hyde Park was opened in a Fort Lee storefront 10 months ago by three young graduates of the Culinary Institute of America. They named it for Hyde Park, N.Y., the home of the institute, and not, as one would assume, for London's famous park. The decor is snappily attractive, with a peach and green color scheme, scenic murals, potted trees in the greenhouse window and park-bench seating. To judge from two recent visits, however, this is a case where the song is sweeter than the bird. Despite the decorating flair, the kitchen needs help. Most of the dishes sampled were barely acceptable.
1981-09-06	Dining Out; QUALITY FARE, ROADHOUSE PLAIN	DANBURY DESMOND'S PUB, just outside Danbury on Route 37, is a restaurant whose prices appear to have more in common with the 1930's than the 1980's. An appetizer, entree and wine cost a prix fixe $11.95. While the menu is limited, there are four appetizers and 10 entrees to choose from. These days, when one sees veal cordon bleu or veal Oscar and Wiener schnitzel on a menu with a fixed price of $11.95, the thought of frozen food inevitably comes to mind. But the dishes we sampled were freshly and competently put together.
1981-09-02	A MONEY FUND NEXT FOR SEARS	Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest retailer, said today that it would start a money market fund this year as part of its continuing strategy to become a major national supplier of financial services. Bankers immediately complained about this specter of still more competition for their industry. ''Our goal is to become the largest consumer-oriented financial service entity,'' Edward R. Telling, chairman and president of Sears, said in a statement. ''With the new tax law, working Americans are going to be in a position to save and in a mood to save. We are well-positioned to be a part of that.''
1981-09-02	MASTERCARD-FIDELITY MONEY FUND DUE	In a move that could link thousands of banks and their customers to the lucrative money market funds, Mastercard International and the Fidelity Management Group said yesterday that they planned to offer a Mastercard Money Manager account. The service, which will allow cardholders to transfer funds from a special checking account into money market funds and other investments, will be available through Mastercard's 12,000 member banks within four months, according to Russell E. Hogg, president and chief executive officer of Mastercard. Fidelity will manage the mutual funds and provide discount brokerage services. ''No longer will banking customers need to leave their bank for high-yield flexible investments - those investments will now be available through their local bank,'' Mr. Hogg said. ''We have planned this very carefully and have designed the program to meet the S.E.C.'s approval.''
1981-08-31	CARD CHIEF FOR CITICORP	Ira S. Rimerman, who has been with Citicorp since 1971, was named Friday as chairman of its Citicard Credit Services subsidiary, the unit that runs its Mastercard and Visa bank card business. But it was business as usual for Mr. Rimerman, and these days one of the prime orders of business is the development of more credit card customers for Citibank, the big New York bank owned by Citicorp.
1981-08-30	Dining Out; A SWING BACK INTO THE OLD FORM	AFTER an absence of two years, Ciro Trotora is back at Ciro's in Yorktown Heights. Having had enough of retirement, the skillful, loquacious chef is cooking and happy at his old post. Although the restaurant has not quite swung back into smooth operation, service seems to improve weekly, and the welcome couldn't be warmer. A wieldy menu, primarily of restrained Southern Italian persuasion scattered with international offerings, favors seafood, veal and chicken - dishes that can be cooked last-minute-fresh. Indeed, this is an advantage; the main courses, however, were not up to the level of the stunning pasta dishes. Spaghetti Monachina proved the uncontested marvel - in this case the whole greater than the sum of its parts: capers, black olives, anchovies and fruity olive oil elegantly compatible in taste and texture with the pasta. For those who cannot live on spaghetti Monachina alone, Carbonara style made a fine alternative, the pasta tossed at the last minute with eggs, prosciutto and Parmesan. Creamy fettuccini Alfredo required just a dusting of cheese for character, and - a lovely idea but a bit steep at $11 - spaghetti with ''lobster sauce'' presented lobster tails and clams with a pepper-sparked pink tomato sauce. Rather heavily salted white clam sauce and cheese ravioli were ordinary.
1981-08-30	Dining Out; INFORMAL, FAMILY-STYLE DINING	MADISON ALTHOUGH it is not on the shore, Friends & Company - located in a modern-looking shingled building on the Post Road - is reported to be one of this resort town's most popular restaurants. Certainly our observation during several meals there would bear this out. The small, rustic dining room is packed and there is usually a waiting line. A glance at the moderate prices on the menu explains part of the popularity. The menu is limited to just a few dishes capably prepared, which may also be a clue to the restaurant's success. But there is more than that. There are several congenial touches that make Friends & Company an informal friendly place to go for lunch or a light family-style dinner.
1981-08-30	A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE IN HARRISON	IN the middle of Harrison's industrial area stands a square white building, unremarkable apart from the brown and white striped awnings and a sign identifying it as a restaurant named Le Saucier. The interior, which is as unexpected as such an establishment on such a site, resembled a chic modern restaurant in Milan. The predominant color is beige - from the block tiled floor, glossy tiled walls and comfortable banquets, to the blinds made of narrow metal strips that cover the windows on three sides of the room. The only colors are in the form of hanging plants and fresh flowers on the tables, which are also attractively set with white cloths over brown.
1981-08-30	Dining Out; NOUVELLE CUISINE INFLUENCES MENU	A NEW menu and an elaborate wine list were inaugurated at La Mascotte in Commack earlier this summer. A nouvelle cuisine influence is now evident. Entrees studded with pink peppercorns or with sauces of fruit-flavored vinegar, dessert platters of assorted fruits with sorbet and dishes that combine variations on the same theme, such as cold mussels with three dressings or steak with three kinds of pepper, are some of the ''nouvelle'' touches that have been added. These revisions have made the dinner menu more interesting and upto-date, but they are often handled tentatively and do not herald a fundamental change in the style of cooking at La Mascotte, most of which remains basically classic. Brown sauces over meats and cream sauces or lobster sauces on seafood still dominate.
1981-08-30	The Careful Shopper; Children's Outlet Opens in Scarsdale	Shoppers from this county are used to trekking to Nanuet, N.Y., or to Teaneck, N.J., for Joey's Children's Wear at 25 to 60 percent off manufacturer's suggested prices. That became unnecessary a month ago, however, when a new Joey's opened with its usual range of nationally advertised wares in the Scarsdale Park Mall on Central Avenue. Periodic specials take prices to below the routine discounts. Sizes are layette to 14 for girls (and preteen in designer jeans) and to 20 (or prep and student sizes of designer shirts) for boys and men's Lee and Levi jeans and corduroys. All merchandise is current, and it includes outerwear such as bibtop ski pants, usually $39, at $29.25, and a hooded jacket in three shades, including pink and maroon, ordinarily $65, at $48.75. An 18-month-old size of snowsuit with hooded jacket sells here for $34.50 - these items come under an additional 10 percent as a preseason sale.
1981-08-23	Dining Out; FRIENDLY INN WITH A FINE VIEW	NEW PRESTON HILLTOP views of Lake Waramaug from the wide glass windows of the Boulder Inn vary pleasingly from season to season. But if you like outdoor dining, you'll opt for summer. During this season you can sit outside on an upper or lower terrace, sheltered from direct sunlight by branches of a large spruce tree. By day you can watch the various lake-side activities as you lunch; by night, if you're lucky, you'll enjoy the sight of the moon through the branches. The service at this rustic stone inn is as agreeable as the atmosphere. The menu at both lunch and dinner is small but international in scope. Many dishes are competently prepared, though occasionally the chef's reach exceeds his grasp. The outdoor setting is so compelling, however, that on a balmy evening, you are in the mood to forgive the occasional mishap.
1981-08-23	Dining Out; LIGHT MEALS IN UNUSUAL SETTINGS	Akaffeehaus, an institution attributed to Viennese genius, has found a home in Armonk. For three months now, Karl Ausserlechner, schooled in Vienna in both cooking and pastry-making, has been overseeing the accomplished kitchen and homey dining room of the singular Kaffee Bazar. The restaurant conveys the feel of European coffee houses; patrons sense that they are welcome to linger over coffee or brandy. The exciting menu satisfied a range of appetites. Special soups, both hot and cold, out of the common run, arrived skimmed of fat and textured artfully -turkey, cucumber and noodle; gazpacho; potato with vegetables; mushroom. All outclassed that menu cliche, onion soup.
1981-08-23	Dining Out; DIM SUM ON THE EAST END	MING'S HSF, the newest branch of HSF, the well-known Chinatown dim sum restaurant, opened this summer in Bridgehampton. The large, rectangular dining room has been done in cool, subtle gray and lavender that deepens to midnight black at the bar. A shiny, silvertoned ceiling adds a slick, sophisticated touch. By far, the best food in the restaurant is the assortment of dim sum, the steamed and fried dumplings and other tidbits that make up the traditional Hong Kong tea lunch. Most of the dim sum for this easternmost outpost of the growing HSF empire are prepared in the Chinatown kitchens and shipped fresh daily to Bridgehampton on refrigerated trucks. The system seems to be a good one because the quality of the dim sum is, virtually without exception, first rate.
1981-08-23	Careful Shopper; Summer Sales In Scarsdale	In the village of Scarsdale, summer sales continue along Spencer Place even after the sidewalk sales are over. Mary Rothman's women's wear specialty shop, 30 years old next February, has most summer items reduced by half, and sometimes 60 to 70 percent, and still provides individual try-on rooms and knowledgeable sales help. Sizes are 3 to 13 for juniors and 6 to 20. All red-ticketed items are final cash sale and merchandise not sold after the progressive reductions will be given away to charities after Labor Day. Nonsale merchandise may be returned for refund or exchange within 10 days, with sales slip and price @ticket. One customer, wearing an outfit purchased in the shop 17 years ago, arrived recently to reassure Mrs. Rothman of the classic wearability of that purchase; another came in to change the color of a comfortable knit cotton shirt she absentmindedly duplicated in an identical brown, and a third woman, back for more, wore an umbrella skirt that had traveled to Oregon as wrinkle-free as promised. Each mailing-list customer - there are 10,000 - gets a presale notice.
1981-08-16	Dining Out; SINGULARITY AMONG THE ANTIQUES	IN a bosky section of Rye, Milton Harbor Inn now occupies the roomy white Colonial that once housed the White Elephant. Studded with old sprawling mansions, many built as fashionable summer residences for the wealthy, this area enjoys a renewed popularity not unrelated to the recent refurbishing of nearby Playland and its increasing attractiveness as a family park. Thus encouraged, a number of restaurants opened a bit too soon over the last two years and failed. But given half a chance, a decent restaurant can usually hold its own through the whimsical calms and tempests of the economy. Milton Harbor Inn looks very much like a survivor. Dieter Hauser, the owner and chef, offers a long menu that has all but become antique, one listing almost solidly classic bourgeois fare: moules ravigote, coq au vin, beef bourguignonne and their compeers.
1981-08-16	SOUTH DAKOTA LOVES CITIBANK, BUT THERE'S NO STAMPEDE	It took nearly two years, but Citibank credit cards have finally taken up official residence in Sioux Falls, S.D., a locale unmarred by usury ceilings. With a ribbon-cutting in June and other proper ceremony, the newcomer professed itself pleased with the Coyote State. The state, flush with new jobs, beamed, and looked for more.
1981-08-16	The Careful Shopper; D'Agostino Planning 'Greatest Carpet Show'	What is billed by D'Agostino Carpet as ''The Greatest Carpet Show on Earth'' will fill the County Center through this week. Setting-up time is tomorrow, and selling is from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. Tuesday through Friday and from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Saturday. The festive atmosphere will come in part from balloons and in part from hundreds of pillows decorated with Miss Piggy, Kermit and Gonzo that will be awarded, one each, with a receipt for a purchase of more than $50. The $3 million inventory will include special purchases as well as D'Agostino's own stock from showrooms in Mount Kisco, Baldwin Place, Peekskill and White Plains - all of which will close for the week - and the Norwalk, Conn., store, which will remain open. The sales and stock staff, naturally, will share a busman's holiday in White Plains.
1981-08-16	SEAFOOD DELIGHTS ON THE NORTH FORK	ONE of the most appealing waterfront settings on the Island is at the Oyster Factory restaurant in Greenport. The weathered, rustic barnlike structure, once the site of an oyster processing plant, overlooks the docks and harbor, busy with the regular activity of the Shelter Island ferry. Tables covered with flower-sprigged cloths have a view of the bay and not of the parking lot, as at many other restaurants situated on the water. This season, the restaurant is run by a couple from Connecticut, Jill and Karl Brussel, who did a commendable job last year at the Lighthouse in East Hampton. Theirs is an international style of cooking, emphasizing seafood. Spanish, French and Indian accents ere evident. Although many of the dishes recall last year's samplings at the Lighthouse, the seasonings seem less vibrant and lusty here. If the two-star rating is less enthusiastic this time, it is for this reason.
1981-08-16	Dining Out; VICTORIAN AIR AT SHORE MANSION	OLD SAYBROOK THE potential at The Castle Inn is considerable. Situated at Cornfield Point with a sweeping view of Long Island Sound, this fieldstone mansion, built in 1906, has the dated charm of late Victorian decor both inside and out. Fieldstone dominates, covering, in fact overwhelming, the walls of the medium-sized dining room, whose other attractions are a large fireplace along one wall and period stained-glass windows in the alcove opposite. Dining with a water view at lunch and early evening can be extemely agreeable, but as darkness descends in the evening, the dim lighting damps down the eeriness of the setting and the heavy use of stone adds to the gloom.
1981-08-14	Restaurants; 2 FACES OF VANESSA AND A FIFTH HISAE	IT would not be hard to believe that there are two entirely different restaurants named Vanessa, both on the same site on Bleecker Street, just east of Seventh Avenue South, and both with the same handsome and romantic deep-purple walls and gleaming Art Deco brass lighting fixtures. One Vanessa is quiet, cool and airy, with well-paced service and pleasantly pretty food in the style best described as nouvelle American, and it attracts a mild-mannered young and informal following. The other Vanessa is jam-packed, crashingly noisy, often stifling, with painfully slow and inept service and food so contrived that it is difficult to swallow more than a few bites. In the later hours when the restaurant is most uncomfortable, oddly enough, the crowd is older and more seriously and stylishly dressed. To experience Vanessa-the-Fair, go for Sunday brunch or before 7:30 any evening, and you will probably have a thoroughly enjoyable, moderate-priced meal, especially if you stick to appetizers and desserts. Like so many restaurants with an expressionist chef who free associates, Vanessa falls down on main courses, primarily because intricate and complicated flavorings and food combinations that can be diverting in appetizer-size portions become cloying in larger amounts.
1981-08-09	Dining Out; SOUTHERN ITALY WITH A TWIST	bag half their main course) and open minds, for although the Italian menu may sound familiar, the owner and inventive chef, Tony Licari, not content with a traditional rendering of southern-influenced offerings, cooks fast and loose. Be prepared for surprises, some quite creditable. For instance, the kitchen harbors a special love for cheese - customers consume about 120 pounds of Parmesan and mozzarella a week. Fistfuls shower many dishes, and in case diners still feel deprived, a bowl of slivered fresh Parmesan usually left on the table may be used with abandon. Snippets of fresh fennel sparked several dishes, an unusual contribution from this cuisine's store of aromatic flavorings, and fresh tomato appeared seemingly everywhere.
1981-08-09	Own Labels Stressed At Scarsdale Boutique	The workroom is larger than the selling area at Tailor Boutique on Route 22 where Scarsdale meets Eastchester, a measure of Irene and George Gimesi's stress on women's clothing with their own label in competition with other designer or manufacturer labels in the retail area. Their earlier shops were in New York City and Ardsley and one personal touch is a memento on display - an autographed photograph of Bette Davis. Gimesi designs can be made to order with fabric they provide and many styles are available as ready-to-wear clothing in a variety of interesting shades. A storewide prevacation sale of 20 to 50 percent off - and some discounted items at more off - will run through Aug. 22. The shop then will close for just one week and reopen Aug. 31 with fall merchandise. The sizes are 3 to 15 and 4 to 18, and there is no charge for alterations on any Gimesi design.
1981-08-02	The Careful Shopper; The Restaurant Store Features Housewares	Kitchen supplies vary in durability and design, often to the frustration of the home cook seeking tools of the trade at the nearest supermarket or hardware store. The Restaurant Store, a division of the Westchester Restaurant Supply Company in Elmsford, serves the public need for commercial-quality home supplies and for gifts of gadgets, copper, silverplate or glassware as well - selling either small quantities at wholesale prices, but no special orders, or wholesale quantities with volume discounts and custom specifications. The company moved to the present location four years ago after 50 years in Mount Vernon. Special sales vary from month to month, with restaurant-strength pots and pans at extra discounts each summer and other specials announced by flier to a mail-order list. No purchase is required for a sweepstakes of Henckels Cutlery worth $250, an anniversary gourmet set, with a closing date of July 31 on mailing the entries. Dishwasher-safe, black-handled gadget sets by Henckel, Marks cutlery, knife blocks (usually $12.15, now $7.99) and magnetic wall brackets for cutlery are also sold.
1981-07-26	APPEALING FARE SERVED BY THE SEA	DESPITE a rather unlikely location in the Sun Haven Motel in Napeague, halfway between Amagansett and Montauk, Le Cocobeach Cafe is one of the better restaurants to make its debut in the Hamptons this season. Come to think of it, the name is also unlikely. Cocoa Beach is more than a thousand of miles away in Florida. But in its informality, the place is definitely beachfront. The proprietor and chef is Daniel Fuchs, a native of Alsace who for many years was the executive chef at Maxwell's Plum in Manhattan. In sharp contrast with the setting at Maxwell's Plum, Le Cocobeach Cafe is sober, austere and somewhat barren, spruced up on a shoestring with white paint and marine blue trim. It's the food that shines.
1981-07-26	Dining Out; PASSABLE FARE AT DINNER THEATERS	WHEN it comes to dinner theaters, the play, not the food, is in the spotlight and is what attracts patrons in the first place. At least that is our conclusion after evenings spent at two Fairfield County dinner theaters. At the Darien Dinner Theater, dinner is served before the show and is part of the theater ticket price, making a moderate package. The setting is attractive. The large theater seats 440 and is arranged in tiers. Tables are nicely set as in a regular restaurant.
1981-07-24	Restaurants; TEX-MEX STAGE SET AND NORTH ITALIAN	SINCE it opened four years ago, El Coyote, on Broadway near Ninth Street, has become one of the livelier and more popular settings for Tex-Mex dining, especially late in the evening. Think more Tex than Mex and you will not be disappointed by this rustic, adobe and knotty-pine eatery with its comfortable booths and its young and obliging staff. A folkloric mural and accessories that suggest a border-town souvenir shop create a cheerful backdrop against which the hefty platters of satisfying, typical specialties can be enjoyed at relatively modest prices. If none of the food quite fills the void in New York City for really great Mexican fare, it is all at least freshly and honestly prepared and a good deal above average. Even the taco chips on each table are crisper and sprightlier than most, and the chili-relish sauce, salsa piquante, served with them is hotly seasoned and can be even more so on request, an accommodation possible with all other food at El Coyote, as well. Stir some of that sauce into the smooth guacamole, and it will improve that decent if slightly bland avocado dip. It also does a lot for the nachos, tortilla wedges topped with refried beans, melted cheese and jalapeno chilies, and for the chalupas, tortillas topped with cheese and guacamole. A porridgy dip of mashed black beans and cheese is also a delicious appetizer to be scooped up with the taco chips.
1981-07-19	Careful Shopper; Bally Discounting Discontinued Styles	All Bally of Switzerland discontinued styles, overruns, closeouts and samples are discounted at the manufacturer's first United States outlet, opened last month at the $5 million world corporate headquarters and computerized distribution center in New Rochelle. First quality, all-leather shoes for men and women are 25 to 50 percent off, as available, beginning at $29.99, along with markeddown handbags, attache cases, wallets, key rings, fur-lined boots and leather clothing. Most Bally merchandise is made in Switzerland and Italy, some in France and England, and the footwear is ordinarily $80 to $250 a pair. The 130-year-old concern has 21 company-owned stores; post-season returns from these shops supply the outlet.
1981-07-19	Dining Out; SEAFOOD AND SEASCAPES	NORWALK GOOD seaside views in a restaurant are no guarantee of equally gratifying food. Such is the case at Skipper's, a large restaurant facing Long Island Sound. The tranquil view cannot be faulted. The two dining levels with wraparound windows take full advantage of the shoreline and the comings and goings of the boats that shuttle back and forth to Long Island. Most dishes at Skipper's are of the sea, with just a few meat dishes for determined landlubbers. The menu is a good-sized one, and if you stick to the simplest broiled items, you will dine passably. It is the ubiquitous fried numbers that cause most of the problems. Like all too many other seafood establishments, Skipper's seems to believe that fried entrees, such as clams, oysters, and soft-shelled crabs, should be ''embalmed'' in a dense batter and then deep-fried to oblivion. Finding the oyster within its batter can be a challenge indeed.
1981-07-19	Dining Out; INVENTION IS THE PHILOSOPHY	INSTALLED in a remodeled brown clapboard house next to the railroad tracks in Chappaqua, The Ordinary has a bright, simple charm with its wide pine floorboards, hanging greenery, starched white-onburgundy linen and remarkable though nonfunctioning espresso machine. Michael Baker, one of the original owners and most recently parttime cook as well, has not yet found his culinary metier. Bocuse and the Troisgros brothers, the granddads of the new French cooking, would sigh at The Ordinary's public declaration of their philosophy. True, The Ordinary does favor light sauces, delicacy, short cooking time, market-fresh produce and, most decidedly, invention; however, this kitchen as often forgets its goal, and treacly sauces, unseasonal or heavy meats, overly salted or perversely bland dishes and leaden desserts appear. And so The Ordinary can at times be ''very'' and then again ''anything but.''
1981-07-19	FOR A PRICE, EVERYONE CAN BE CREDITWORTHY	What a deal. You deposit anywhere from $300 to $2,000 in the bank, and in return get the opportunity to earn 5 1/4 percent annual interest. Then you can borrow as much as you have in the bank, as long as you don't withdraw the deposit money. For this you pay only 18 percent interest. One other feature: a $25 annual fee. The whole package seems too bad to be true. Who in his right mind would take it? The answer is people with past bad debt problems, young people having difficulty establishing credit and just plain poor people.
1981-07-19	Dining Out; NO JAPANESE STEAK HOUSE, THIS	SINCE its opening last January, Sukeroku, a Japanese restaurant in Little Falls, has earned a word-of-mouth reputation that keeps it filled to capacity most evenings. This proves that many diners in New Jersey are interested in this particular cuisine. However, it is unfortunate that a serious restaurant such as this, which is operated primarily by Japanese, fails to take the opportunity to teach occidentals the intricacies and order of Japanese meals. For example, a Kaiseki meal can be ordered in advance. This is the perfect way for anyone unfamiliar with the traditional Japanese way of eating to begin, but only the Japanese and the initiated are aware that such meals are available.
1981-07-17	Restaurants; A COOL SHUSHI HOUSE ON A SUMMER'S DAY	REFERRING to the tropical look of the traditional Japanese bamboo and paper house, Fosco Maraini in his book ''Meeting With Japan'' observed: ''The Japanese often live in northern snows with the provisional attitude of southerners forced northward by events.'' Bernard Rudofsky, in his book ''The Kimono Mind,'' quotes the 14th-century philosopher Yoshida Kenko: ''A house should be built with the summer in view. In the winter, one can live anywhere.'' Much the same observations can be made about Japanese food, we decided as we sampled the cooling sushi, sashimi, chilled noodles and savory cold to tepid appetizers at the small and rustic Nada Sushi restaurant on 50th Street just east of Lexington Avenue during the recent heat wave. Limp with the summer heat, we enjoyed the restorative powers of soft white bean curd chilled on ice and then dipped in a blend of dried bonita flakes, seaweed, ginger and soy sauce, the cold buckwheat noodles, soba, and the wheat vermicelli, suomen, which was doused with soy sauce sparked by green wasabi horseradish and minced scallions.
1981-07-12	The Careful Shopper; Greater Than Usual Markdowns on Tano	The 30,000 mailing-list customers of Tano Inc. have been informed of its semiannual sale, with increases in the usual markdowns of 20 to 40 percent on its own shoes, handbags, attache cases and luggage, and drastic markdowns on seasonal wares from other major manufacturers. Larchmont's outlet, opened early last month, is the newest in Westchester, with others in Hartsdale, Mount Kisco, Yonkers, The Galleria in White Plains and Peekskill. A Tano shop at Mohegan Lake is planned for late summer, the 14th shop. Not all styles of Tano are carried in its own outlets, thus protecting pricing policies of other retail stores. Even so, the variety is impressive: hand-woven leathers, suedes, nylon, linen or canvas with leather, macrame with wood, woven straw with snakeskin and laminated straw with brass fittings are all on hand in handbags, feedbags, envelopes, satchels, shoulder and hobo bags in dull and shiny finishes and in framed and frameless shapes. Shoes vary from espadrilles at $24 to $29 to snakeskin evening shoes at a top price of $55 with other styles of pumps, flats, sandals and clogs, all discounted initially and with end-of-season clearance items offering the greatest cuts.
1981-07-12	Dining Out; SKILLFULLY SPICES HUNAN FARE	WESTPORT AS recently as three years ago, there were few, if any, Hunanstyle Chinese restaurants in Connecticut. Since then, at least three or four have sprung up in Fairfield County alone. This peppery and oily style of Chinese cooking has caught on, as has its near neighbor Sichuan. The newest Hunan restaurant is Hunan Garden, which opened just over two months ago in Westport. It has the same ownership as the Hunan Garden in Riverside, but is much better. In fact, it is probably the best example of this style of cooking in the area.
1981-07-12	Dining Out; A NORTH-SOUTH ITALIAN BALANCE	PERHAPS because its kitchen uses garlic with a restrained hand, La Riserva in Larchmont bills itself as a restaurant offering northern Italian cuisine. Somehow the cooking of Italy's northern regions has become fashionable and that of the south looked upon with relative contempt - refined, light prepartions associated with the north and heavy, oily, spicy dishes with the south, assumptions that have some basis but many exceptions. Despite La Riserva's claim to allegiance to the north, however, it offers a healthy representation of many of Italy's regions, and diners can enjoy a smooth, subtle tortellini with cream as well as bold peppery tomato sauce ''pizzaiola.''
1981-07-05	Dining Out; ITALIAN FARE IN ATTRACTIVE SETTING	backed chairs covered in rust-colored plush complete the attractive look. Few changes have been made on the menu, however, and the preparation seems about the same as in the past. The food is generally acceptable, but rarely offers enchantment. On weekend evenings, when the restaurant is packed and the staff is pressured, the quality of the food and service suffers. Weekday evenings are more pleasant.
1981-07-05	The Careful Shopper; A Source of Supplies For Bike Enthusiasts	For the serious cyclist, acquiring well-equipped bicycles, accessories, tools, clothing and shoes for touring can pose a problem. Just 10 miles north of White Plains on I-684 (or seven miles up Route 22), the Country Bike Center in Armonk is unusually well supplied. It also runs tours to Spain (each February, when the store is closed), to Israel (Nov. 7 to 23 this year, the fifth trip there), and perhaps again to New Zealand. Repairs are made, whenever possible, while you wait, and tuneups are completed within five days, considerably faster service than that provided by overworked down-county shops, which often store bikes for a week before working on them. Closeout bikes for adults and children in front of the shop are discounted by 30 percent and some biking shoes are 30 to 50 percent off in odd sizes for both men and women. The nylon shoes begin at $32.95 otherwise and the leather biking shoes range from $45 to $70. Panniers and covers are on hand in varying sizes and prices, and front bags begin at $26 and go to $55 with a more elaborate set of pockets. Featherweight yellow rain capes in a self-contained drawstring bag, designed for safer and drier travels, cover from the helmet on down, including hand loops, and sell for $35, medium and large only.
1981-07-05	Dining Out; AMBIANCE AND RIB-STICKING FARE	NOT very much has changed at The Tap in Bronxville since 1934. A light-handed sprucing up by the present owners, Marge Blaner, Peter Behrens and the chef, Dieter Schott, has left the period bar, cut glass, murals of Alpine scenes and comfortable old-world ambiance intact. The menu still lists some dishes that have a decidedly German cast, but they make up a small part of the menu that now favors ribsticking American food and no-nonsense fish selections. The Tap's lengthy menu is, in fact, remarkable in two ways: its prices veer to the bargain side of reasonable and the menu changes daily, not only for lunch but also for dinner. For instance, from the many items one might choose a dinner consisting of soup, broiled pork chops with apple sauce, potatoes, vegetable, salad, peach Melba and coffee for $9.95. And, in general, the food is straightforward wholesome and plentifully portioned.
1981-07-05	The Careful Shopper; Roses Are a Bargain At Westport Store	Because too much of shopping is a ritual search for necessities at affordable prices, it is a pleasure to be guided to a tiny, whimsical flower shop in Westport called Miss Plum's Particulars, the Old-Fashioned Store, that uses a hedgehog wearing an apron as its logo. Here the weekend bargain - and sometimes midweek, too - is four miniature roses for $2, locally grown Greens Farms roses quite capable of filling the car with their scent once well out of range of the cooler. Preservation of that $2 limit despite rising wholesale costs is a matter of principle for the owner, David Quigley, an English teacher for 13 years, who is now enjoying his ''reincarnation'' as a retailer. Not all varieties of fresh flowers are found so close to home. Trips to 28th Street in New York City - at 3 A.M. for the ''best of the lot'' - are mandatory on the Wednesday before major projects: wedding and tent receptions, historical society holiday celebrations in Colonial homes and creations for mantelpieces, front doors and spiral staircases. Mr. Quigley handpicks buds and blossoms at his own and friends' gardens, drying them from the rafters of the cottage when their fresh uses are past, both for later arrangements and for his own potpourri. Unprotected wildflowers also are seasoned and used, the mix of real and unreal flower displays creating a remarkable effect.
1981-06-30	SICHUAN CUISINE: ANOTHER SOURCE	IN the last year, more than a half-dozen Chinese restaurants have opened in southern Westchester, and every one has been commendable in one way or another. This reassuring record is a testimonial not only to the amplitude and authority of the cuisines of China but also to the wide distribution of culinary skills among the Chinese in America. It all derives from the Chinese passion for food, of course. Not even the French and Italians are such natural-bred, analytic, argumentative food critics as the Chinese. And seeing a group of Chinese in a restaurant makes one wonder whether the Chinese ideogram for happiness, which pictures various less appropriate things, ought not rather show a large family at dinner. Whatever the reasons for the bounty, southern Westchester has picked up its chopsticks and enjoyed it. Now Szechuan House, an offshoot of Scarsdale's long-established Szechuan Flower, has opened in an Elmsford shopping center, and we seem to have yet another fairly dependable source for the spicy, complex dishes of Sichuan Province.
1981-06-28	Dining Out; BY LAND OR LAKE, A NAUTICAL MOTIF	LA BONNE VIE on Lake Mahopac has long been discovered by those who approach its dockside from waterskis or boat. Entering the restaurant from the other direction, landmen, too, will find that the dock, suspended over the water, makes an unusual and pleasant place to have a drink or a meal while one watches swift, silent sailboats cut across the vast lake, busy gaggles of geese, and willow trees cascading into the water that gently laps the shore. Much of this panorama can be appreciated through the large window of the dining room as well, but we would save that view for other seasons and chilly evenings. Right now, outside is where the action is.
1981-06-28	Dining Out; REFRESHING SIMPLICITY IN AN OLD MILL	FARMINGTON IN the summer, many Nutmeggers' dining-out thoughts tilt toward the Sound. Yet one of the prettiest water views is inland. The Reading Room Restaurant, ensconced in an old grist mill on the Farmington River, uses its location well. Big picture windows afford diners a wide-angle view of surging waters and trout fishermen. Nature enhances the view with a spectacular sunset that casts orange and rosy rays until almost 9 P.M. It is a dining bonus. Not every one of the 18 tables has a water view. It is a pleasant little dining room, nonetheless, with a decidedly woodsy feeling in keeping with its locale: knotty-pine paneled walls, low ceilings, butcher-block tables, cushion-covered benches around half the room, bentwood chairs, track lighting overhead, and a simple blue-edged white tableware that picks up the color of the cushions. Well-planned simplicity is the keynote.
1981-06-27	Consumer Saturday; 2 LOSSES IS LIMIT FOR BANK CARDS	S USAN HANNAH's wallet, with several credit cards inside, was stolen for the second time in two years during her recent vacation. When she returned to Manhattan, the Chemical Bank refused to reissue her Visa and MasterCard cards because ''such instances create a high risk of fraudulent misuse of the cards and subsequent losses to the bank,'' a form letter from the bank stated. ''It made no difference that my credit rating was good, that the previous loss had occurred two years earlier or that the stolen cards had never been used,'' said Miss Hannah. The policy to close a credit account after a card is twice lost or stolen is widespread among New York banks, but not widely known. None of the 11 public information officials contacted at banks offering Visa or MasterCard accounts was familiar with the policy. After checking with their credit departments, spokesmen at the Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company confirmed that the policy was in effect.
1981-06-26	Restaurants; Viennese style, restful and plush.	IN the strict sense, double jeopardy refers to the possibility of a person being tried twice for the same crime. But that is the term that always comes to mind when we hear of a restaurant owner who opens a second establishment. ''Double jeopardy'' hardly seems adequate to describe the compounding of difficulties facing the owner of an already successful restaurant who must find a second competent staff and who tries to divide his attention between restaurants at two locations. Fearless on that score, and apparently for the best of reasons, Peter Grunauer, originator and owner of the four-star Vienna '79 restaurant at 320 East 79th Street, has opened Vienna Park on East 60th Street between Madison and Park Avenues on the site of the short-lived Claret's. As the name suggests, Vienna is again the theme that inspires the new kitchen, and inspired it must be, because even after a two-month warm-up period, the food offered is impressive - often excellent -and rarely less than fair. Though the Vienna Park is a good deal larger than Vienna '79 and the color scheme tends toward soft and restful shades of taupe instead of gray, the same feeling of tailored plushness prevails, with such decorative touches as graceful floral bouquets, prints of Lippizaner horses and, in one dining room, a blow-up of an antique map of Vienna.
1981-06-25	CUBA IS MOVING TO BROADEN TRADE IN BID FOR DOLLARS	It intends, for the first time under the present regime, to share with foreign corporations both the ownership and management of a luxury tourist resort on the island of Cayo Largo, off Cuba's southern coast, where a free port comparable to those in the United States Virgin Islands is to be set up. It also quietly established, about a year ago, a fast-growing commerical trading company, Commercial Muralla, which is trying to buy and sell products ranging from frozen cattle embryos to cement for cash, bypassing Cuba's usual state trading channels. And, according to reliable sources, one Cuban official told Canadian executives in March that Havana was so eager for hard currency - not available from Communist-bloc trading partners - that artificially low production figures were being reported to Moscow, so undeclared surpluses could be sold to the West for cash. Need for Access to West These developments, according to some Western diplomats in Havana, underscore Cuba's determination to put more flexibility in its own economy and to gain better access to Western products, markets and financial resources, despite the United States trade embargo, which was imposed in February 1961 in response to Cuban confiscation of United States property and growing hostilities between the two countries.
1981-06-21	Dining Out; ITALIAN CUISINE IN CHEERFUL SETTING	STAMFORD THE proliferation of quality restaurants that some thought would accompany the arrival of all the corporate headquarters in Stamford has not materialized. But relatively new and interesting restaurant choices can nevertheless be found. One of them is Vittorio Continental Cuisine on Hope Street, which is better than most Italian restaurants in the area. For one thing, it has a very small menu, which promises - and usually delivers - freshly made dishes painstakingly prepared. Further, there is little dependence on the ubiquitous tomato sauce so insistently overused in many Italian restaurants.
1981-06-21	Dining Out; JAPANESE FOOD SERVED WITH GRACE	JAPANESE restaurants serving authentic dishes, a novelty on the Island just a year or so ago, are now becoming fairly commonplace. The latest addition to the growing list is Kurofune in Commack. Kurofune has a compact, brightly attractive sushi bar flanked by small dining rooms. The sushi bar, manned by a genial chef and displaying an elaborate array of fish and condiments, is the area of the restaurant that is the most authentic in appearance. The dining rooms are sparsely, inexpensively decorated, and some Japanese art work pinned to the walls is the only attempt to relieve the plainness.

1981-06-19	Restaurants; Turtle Bay French and SoHo snuggery.	WHY does a chef who produces very good to excellent food at one restaurant suddenly descend to mediocrity at another? The relationship of owner to chef (when, of course, they are not one and the same) is among the more perplexing questions of restaurant life and one that presented itself again during recent visits to La Petite Marmite, the spacious and comfortable contemporary restaurant in the Beekman Tower Hotel on the corner of First Avenue and 49th Street. Just about six weeks ago, Pascal Dirringer, formerly at La Gauloise in Greenwich Village, took over in the kitchen, there to cook his way into partnership with Jacky Ruette who has owned La Petite Marmite since 1968. With a more ambitious and expensive menu than the one at La Gauloise, but with some of the same specialties, Mr. Dirringer's performance is uneven, ranging from fair to very good, although at La Gauloise his cooking was well worth two stars.
1981-06-14	"The Careful Shopper;
Insulated Windows Offered at Discounts"	"The end of cold weather prompts some homeowners to consider actions to reduce fuel bills next winter. One popular measure is the installation of permanently insulated windows, especially as replacements for storm windows that need putting up and taking down in exchange for screens season after season.

The Westchester WindowRama outlet is just opposite Turco's, which is in Hartsdale, but it is on the White Plains portion of Central Avenue. It specializes in Andersen ''bays and bows'' at 40 percent off list price and offers 30 percent off on narrow-line, casement, awning, double-hung, sliding windows and gliding doors with Thermopane glass. The windows go to Farmingdale, L.I., as flat units and are assembled there into the custom angle or shape needed, with at least a two-week wait for delivery."
1981-06-14	"Dining Out;
WHERE THE DECOR TAKES A BACK SEAT"	"SOMETIMES it seems that the quality of the cuisine in suburban Chinese restaurants is in inverse proportion to the plushness of the decor. Hunan, a popular family restaurant in Berkeley Heights, near Summit, is a case in point.

Although this 3-year-old restaurant is in a plain little building and its interior has no pretentions to style, Hunan's kitchen turns out a number of dishes that are very good indeed.

The no-frills decor is softened by linens on the tables and floral paintings on matchstick hangings in the downstairs dining room, but stark simplicity reigns in the large room upstairs."
1981-06-14	Dining Out; MIX OF CHINESE REGIONAL FAVORITES	MIDDLETOWN REGIONAL consistency is not a strong suit of most of Connecticut's Chinese restaurants, and diners seem to like it that way. A restaurant's name may suggest Peking, Hunan or Sichuan cooking, but it is more than likely the menu will be a melange of various regional dishes, drawing on favorites from all parts of China. The Peking House in Middletown fits this pattern. Hot Sichuan and Hunan dishes are printed in red on the menu, but also offered are Peking duck (two days' notice required), moo shu pork and a number of Cantonese dishes. In short, it provides a sampling of current favorites.
1981-06-14	Dining Out; A CRITIC'S CHOICES FOR CHINESE	CUISINE By M. H. REED CHINESE cuisine has always been a favorite with American diners. It seems to offer an infinite variety of dishes, and it is cheap. There is almost no other highly developed cuisine that can match the Chinese for economy and efficiency in its use of materials. The Chinese practice of cutting most meats into small pieces has several great advantages: it extends meat dishes and allows preparations of animal parts that might otherwise be too tough or unappealing. And the practice contributes considerably to the vast diversity of the cuisine. Chinese restaurants usually offer at least 60 dishes, and a listing of 100 isn't exceptional. Recently, Hunan-Sichuan cuisine has been in vogue and, indeed, the great majority of restaurants sampled in Westchester emphasized this regional cooking, although there are at least five or six other major cuisines in China. In the 30 or so restaurants we visited, there seemed to be a reluctance to depart from this presently popular school and, so we did find rather a conformity of offerings. In light of this tendency ad centrum, one of the qualities we looked for was originality. Credit went to those restaurants that offered some seldom-encountered dishes such as vegetable pie, fish in bean curd skin, venison or pig's ear.
1981-06-07	"Dining Out;
On the Other Side of the Delaware"	"Bucks County has the idyllic scenery that tourists usually go to Europe to find. Winding country roads edging the Delaware River or cutting through lush green hillsides give the impression that the modern-day world is far away. This area of Pennsylvania also contains some of the most interesting and attractive restaurants at which the food - good, bad or indifferent - takes second place to the atmosphere.

The Golden Pheasant Inn in Erwinna fits in perfectly with the countryside. The lovely old fieldstone inn, which dates from 1857, is caught on a tiny strip of land bordered on one side by the Delaware River and on the other by the Delaware Canal."

Business Supplies At Two Locations"	"When an office-equipment concern in White Plains began business, it used the initials of the company' s three founders, NBB. It now calls itself National Business Brands because, the owners say, so many of the catalog's 22,000 items are widely advertised products.

Most items are in stock at the retail store with a 20 percent discount on all purchases of supplies of more than $100. Additional desks, chairs, furniture and file cabinets are displayed at an NBB warehouse two miles away, where prices are 40 to 80 percent off suggested list prices."
1981-06-07	"The Careful Shopper;
Discount Offered On Butcher Blocks"	"Great North Woods Ltd., a Manhattan factory, usually sells its 25-inch-wide butcher block at three New York City stores and in Westport at $25 a lineal foot for kitchen countertop remodeling.  Beginning June 15, the first countertop sale offers a 40 percent discount only at the the Westport shop and until June 30. The new price is $15 a lineal foot, reducing the usual cost of $300 on a 12-foot counter by $120 in washable or oiled finishes.

By chance, a second item in this sale, of rock maple or oak butcher block, costs just that ''saved'' $120 instead of the usual $199. It is a popular Bar B.Q. cart with a cutting board carved into its 18-by-36-inch sliding top, an inset bin of stainless steel for ice or food and implement hooks built-in. Customers find it useful in offices, dens, kitchens and lunchrooms as well as on patios. A similar 20-by-30-inch butcher block table on casters, with slatted lower shelf, is reduced from $129 to $99."
1981-06-07	Dining Out; COZY TOUCHES, HOME COOKING	DANBURY IT is reassuring that in this age of fast foods, new restaurants devoted to fresh, home-cooked dishes continue to open and, in many instances, thrive. Such a one is Heart to Hand in Danbury. Like many of its genre, Heart to Hand is small, with a refreshingly limited menu. The restaurant began as a craft shop-and-restaurant, but the crafts have receded to mere decorative touches on shelves and walls. The restaurant is lodged in a white frame house, trimmed with bright red and with red hearts painted on front and side. Inside, three minuscule dining rooms are decorated in gingham - one in brown, the second in blue, the third in yellow and green. Paintings and handthrown stoneware pots line the walls and shelves. The net effect is homey. A blackboard menu in each room augments the small soup, sandwich and salad printed menu. Heart to Hand is open every weekday for lunch, but only Friday evenings for dinner with a menu similar to that at lunch. Each day there are two or three specials, as well as soups of the day. Sometimes the choices are more felicitous than others. For instance, one day's menu featured Swedish meatballs as one of three choices, and a meatloaf sandwich as a second.

1981-06-07	DEE HOCK'S COSMIC VISTA FOR VISA INTERNATIONAL	IN the beginning was the committee. At its head was a country banker, and although no college diploma graced his office wall, he had something better: a grasp of the wonders contained in a sliver of plastic. Credit. Traveler's checks. Debit cards. Travel and expense. Money market funds. Any exchange of value, no matter what. And as fast as you can say electronic funds transfer, Dee Ward Hock, now chief executive of Visa International, is off concocting some new use for the blue and white card. ''It started out as a little credit card, which was the stupidest marketing mistake in history,'' said Mr. Hock. ''Visa is a device for the exchange of value.'' In short, it's the next thing to money.
1981-05-31	"The Careful Shopper;
Danbury Outlet Discounts Maternity Clothing"	"Maternity Warehouse Outlet in Danbury's Commerce Plaza reduces suggested retail prices by 15 to 60 percent on slacks, shorts and jeans (4 to 44); dresses (4 to 20, with some extra large in 38 to 44), bathing suits and lingerie. Local Lamaze class participants with cards from the Childbirth and Family Development Institute get an additional 10 percent discount on nursing lingerie only. At the back of the store is a collection of wool, denim and corduroy jumpers, pants and skirts and longsleeved fashions and outerwear - all at drastically reduced prices with all sales final.

Designers Evelyn de Jong, Lester Hyatt, Cynthia Gregg, Catherine Stein and Carol Horn, all known for maternity fashions as well as before-and-after styles, are represented as well as Sasson, Ma Mere, Lady-in-Waiting and Fine Sports. Right in with the vogue for camouflage fabric is a blouse, elsewhere $27, for $21.49 as shown paired with a khaki front-pleated skirt of poly-cotton with stretch panel at the waist, marked $19, but sold here for $15.99. A floweredall-over sheer sleeveless dress with Peter Pan collar, originally $34, is $24.99."
1981-05-31	"The Careful Shopper;
Capezio Has Leotards And Dance Footwear"	"Capezio Dance-Theater Shops, to use the official name, represent a family known for dance footwear since 1887, and the retail outlets also carry men's, women's and children's dance supplies and theatrical makeup. Capezio recently reopened in White Plains with a champagne reception in a more spacious location at 420 Mamaroneck Avenue. Capezio, which also has a store in Stamford, displays the latest in leotard styles and colors and the most up-to-date character and jazz shoe fashions.

Each store always has a sale basket, and prices are $4 to $5 for discontinued leotard styles - the frame, or square neck, which is sleeveless, the short-sleeve zip neck and the double V. The markdown corner has other half-price leotards, jazz pants, jumpsuits, unitards (also called solotards) and skirts until sold out.

Merchandise is for nondancers, too, with hard-to-find bun-holders for long hair, at $3.50. White satin long-sole, flexible ballet slippers at $20 appeal both to brides and to tall prom dates with shorter escorts. Orders can be taken for white, pink and black leather slippers at $20, or for gold, silver, ice-blue or metallic leather at $25."
1981-05-31	Dining Out; STYLISH SIMPLICITY FACING THE PARK	HARTFORD WITH its many downtown renovations of recent years, Hartford deserves as many attractive restaurants as it can get. Fortunately, in Hubbard's Park it has a stylish one indeed. The restaurant, located on the ground floor of an old brick building that used to house a clothing store, derives its name from a former Governor, Richard D. Hubbard, during whose administration (1877-79) Bushnell Park was built. The restaurant faces the park, in which there is a statue of Governor Hubbard.
1981-05-30	Your Money; Selecting A Credit Card	WHAT'S the best credit card deal for the average American? The answer lies in the use made of the card. Each type - the bank card, the retail charge card, oil company card and travel-and-entertainment card - offers a specific use and thus a distinct advantage. But trying to substitute one for the other can be troublesome, if not unproductive. For purposes of the most direct comparisons, the evaluation might best be made between the two major bank cards, Visa and MasterCard, on the one hand, and the three major travel-and-entertainment cards, American Express, Diner's Club and Carte Blanche, on the other. The biggest differences and advantages are the following: - The bank cards offer revolving credit and a smaller credit line, usually from $500 to $2,000, with the limit rarely exceeded.
1981-05-30	LEARNING TO ACCEPT FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILTY	The language of finance is still new to many women, and they are just beginning to speak it with some fluency. In the past, women may have been responsible for paying household bills, but that was often as far as their financial acumen was stretched, either by family design or their own desire. Certainly many were not given to chatting with friends about Treasury notes, bonds and money market funds, as many husbands and fathers were. Now more women are reading financial publications and enrolling in courses on personal money management. As more of them enter the labor market and ascend the career ladder, they seem to be assuming responsiblity for major financial decisions - for themselves if they are single, for their families if they are married. But just how many women have progressed from tending the household budget to establishing savings and investment plans remains debatable. Some women who are experts in investments, banking and insurance contend that women are taking informed control of their income; others say they are still baffled by finance and defer to the advice of men. Impressive Strides Janet Boswell, a chartered underwriter and representative for the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, who started selling life insurance seven years ago, argues that women have made impressive strides.
1981-05-29	Restaurants; Two cuisines with Latin accents.	IF there is no consistently excellent Mexican restaurant in the city, there are at least several places that offer a few wellprepared specialties of that ethnic kitchen. For almost 30 years, El Charro on Charles Street in Greenwich Village has had a loyal coterie that has come to rely on certain dishes. The setting is friendly, convivial and rustically Mexican, the prices are low to moderate, and if you pick your way carefully among menu choices, you can leave well satisfied. The two consistent flaws that could be corrected easily are the commercial, textureless tortillas that lend an inferior quality to the dishes that include them, and the bland and slick tomato sauce basic to so many preparations. Those who like Mexican food to be fiery hot should say so at the beginning of the meal and be insistent. The ordinary dipping sauce for tostado chips is bland, but a properly incendiary one is forthcoming on request. Stir it into the guacamole, and it becomes delicious, and it also does a lot for otherwise characterless huevos rancheros - fried eggs in a mild tomato-and-pepper sauce.

Put Lift in Your Life; Get on Your Toes"	"Capezio Dance-Theater Shops represent a family known for dance footwear since 1887. They also carry men's, women's and children's dancing supplies and theatrical makeup. Deliveries permitting, there will be new leotard and shoe styles, fabrics and colors in the Stamford store in time to help celebrate, without the champagne, the move of the Westchester branch to a larger location at 420 Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains on Wednesday.

Each store has a sale basket; the price is between $4 and $5 on discontinued leotard styles. The markdown corner has other half-price leotards, jazz pants, jumpsuits, unitards and skirts."
1981-05-24	"Dining Out;
SEVEN WEEKS OLD, BUT MAKING NEWS"	"GOOD news travels fast. Jillyflower's in Harrison, open for only seven weeks, clearly is enjoying a fast-spreading reputation for good food, some of it excellent. Under the aegis of two men - thorough restaurant professionals both -Michael Denslow directing the dining room and Mark Filippo attending the stove, this attractive restaurant is already solidly booked on weekends. Ironically, dining here was better midweek, the pace less hectic, the food more securely prepared.

The expertise and judgment of this team revealed themselves in the first glance at the carefully controlled and orchestrated menu.  Printed in the white silhouette of an apple, a jillyflower, no doubt, the bill of fare presents no more than a half-dozen each of appetizers, entrees and desserts. A blackboard menu announces about three or four seasonal specials and offers thoughtful recommendations for a red and a white wine that may be had by the glass."
1981-05-24	Dining Out; ITALIAN FARE WITH EMPHASIZED DECOR	COMPARED with some honeymoon palaces in the Poconos or catering establishments on the Island, La Romantica in Copiague is almost subdued. Still, it does not let the romantic scene go to waste. The main dining room, entered from a silvery vestibule atwitter with the sound of birds, is bathed in soft light with sparkling pink insets in the ceiling and fabric roses in bud vases on the tables. Window tables, much in demand, have a view of a small lake, in the middle of which are stranded some illuminated baroque fountains and statuary, like the grounds of an Italian villa after a flood. A second dining room is so completely suffused with a rosy glow that even the fettuccine looks pink.
1981-05-24	TRADITIONAL MENU IN GLITTERY SETTING	DARIEN DARIEN'S new restaurant, Twin Faces East, advertises itself as ''a restaurant plus.'' It took two visits to discover what that ''plus'' was - a huge ballroom in the back of the restaurant. It is a commentary on the building's good acoustics that we spent our first evening in the dining room nearest the bar without being aware of the disco-rock goings-on in the rear room that leads off the same bar. Well-modulated soft music is piped into each dining room, so that the sounds in the ballroom are insulated from diners. The name, Twin Faces East, comes from the fact that the owners are twin brothers, Dick and Bob Babian, and the restaurant is in the East. Twin Faces East is a novelty for Fairfield County, evoking echoes of Miami cum Las Vegas in its lavish, glittery theatricality. There are two sizable dining rooms, both color-coordinated in pearl gray and dubonnet, with expensive-looking accouterments, mirrors, chrome light fixtures, comfortable padded modern chairs with chromed steel bases and menus that complement the colors and design of the room.
1981-05-17	"DINING OUT;
A NEW ROLE FOR AN OLD ROADHOUSE"	"THERE is a sophisticated little restaurant up in the hills of Passaic County called, of all things, St. Charlie's. The name is the whimsy of the young owners, Charles Nuzzo and his wife, Andrea Carr.

Two and a half years ago, they renovated what had been an old roadhouse on Route 23 in Oak Ridge and came up with an atmosphere that is both casual and smart.

There are two dining rooms. The larger one has rough stucco walls, dark-wood floors and country-print tablecloths, while the side room has paneling of blonde wood, botanical prints and hanging baskets."
1981-05-17	"DINIG OUT;
ON THE WATERFRONT, PORTUGUESE STYLE"	"SINCE its inception four years ago, the Auberge Maxime in North Salem has clearly become one of the most inventive and successful restaurants in the county. The chef-owner, Bernard Le Bris, has developed a classic, interesting basic menu supplemented by six duck specialties and a number of daily offerings suitable to the season.

Food preparation is an art here, all the dishes lovingly garnished. Apart from some difficulties with duck, the menu offered notable and excellent choices beginning with the appetizers; the best of the very good offerings were smoked salmon in a flaky crust, plump oysters and mussels with champagne sauce in puff pastry, Scandinavian platter of three delicately smoked fish vitalized by horseradish sauce, creamy nutmeg-scented spinach in puff pastry, flavorful escargots, meat and fish pates, perfect asparagus. In fact, of all the appetizers, the only disappointment was underripe melon, not sweet enough to offset the salinity from the fine, silky smoked ham."
1981-05-17	"The Careful Shopper;
Men's Clothing At 35-40% Off"	"Despite shifts in shopping patterns to suburban strip development, an established store can opt to remain in the same location but join a discount marketing group to keep up with the competition. Frank Martin and Sons Inc., begun in downtown Stamford as a the men's clothing store in 1892, is still in the same ownership and run by a daughter-in-law and a granddaughter. It is part of a larger merchandising group specializing in designer, conventional and traditional styles in sizes up to 50 extra long at prices always 35 or 40 percent off suggested retail prices, sometimes as high as 60 percent.

The service aspects of the family shop remain - alterations on the premises at cost and fittings for rental or purchase of formal wear downstairs."
1981-05-17	Dining Out; SENSE OF THE EXOTIC IN NEW HAVEN	NEW HAVEN INDIAN restaurants in Connecticut are almost as rare as banyan trees. This makes the discovery of the Taj Mahal in New Haven a double pleasure: first, to find one at all and, second, to discover that it knows its onions - or curries, as the case may be. The Taj Mahal is a tiny establishment - just a few tables - near the center of downtown New Haven, a block away from the Yale campus. Its low prices and largely youthful clientele suggest that students know good value when they find it. Once you step through an unprepossessing, weatherbeaten front door, you find yourself in a brightly colored world of India, with an appliqued Orissa canopy overhead, lemon-colored walls ornamented with Indian prints, cutout archways and carved wooden screens. Recordings of Indian music add to the slightly exotic atmosphere.
1981-05-16	OUTFITTING CHILDREN FOR CAMP	shirts, swimsuits, pajamas, flashlights, mess kits, blankets, etc., that children need to face the wilds of Maine or Massachusetts, you'd better start moving. Trunks are supposed to be shipped off in early June - only two weeks away. Experienced parents try to get everything done by the end of April. Parents of first-time campers who haven't checked the camp list yet may be in for a shock at the amount of gear required, the cost and the need to label everything (down to each sock and toothbrush) with the child's name. The easiest way to cope is to take the list of necessities supplied by the camp, fill in the sizes and send or bring the list to a camp outfitting store.
1981-05-15	Restaurants; From the Levant to York Ave. Gallic.	AMONG the world's great ethnic appetizer combinations, none is more sensual or diverting than Middle Eastern meze, that array of salads, spreads and dips accented with sesame, mint, scallion and yogurt, and meant to be eaten with hot and grainy pita bread. The most subtly delicate version of these hors d'oeuvres appear in Lebanon, and so it should come as no surprise to find really wonderful meze at Beirut, the lively restaurant and nightclub on 32d Street, just west of the Avenue of the Americas. The setting is typically informal and darkly mysterious, with muted red walls and pierced-brass lanterns casting lacy shadows. Sunday through Thursday, dinner is fairly slow paced and quiet, except for some recorded Middle Eastern music played at low pitch. But things really take off on Friday and Saturday nights, when there is a live band, a singer, a professional belly dancer, complete with seven veils, and best of all, customers who get up and sing and dance to Lebanese folk music. Forget about all conversation at such times and give yourself up to the ear-splitting moment, and you can have an unusual and entertaining time, even if you don't find yourself humming the lessthan-catchy tunes on the way out. Sunday afternoons and evenings, families sit around large tables, eating for hours - also colorful and a whole lot quieter.
1981-05-10	"The Careful Shopper;
From Stoneware To Cookware"	"A Norwalk reader who is a professional cook found a Westport store, Peggy Kahn's, with ''continual sales of high quality cookware and gifts.'' The shop was started eight years ago as a ''seconds'' outlet for Bennington Pottery, the Vermont stoneware, but switched one year ago to the company's ''firsts'' and added other products, many discounted 10 percent or more.

The sounds of copper and bronze Cosanti windbells ($10 to $150) may greet a shopper on a breezy day. There is also a stock of the earlier ceramic bells for from $30 to more than $40. Useful, decorative and picnic baskets, the last $16 to $75, are American-made and imported.  All Calphalon cookware is 10 percent off. Le Creuset kitchenware is slightly under list price."

1981-05-10	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Luggage Bargains In White Plains"	"Victoria Luggage, in business in the White Plains area for 32 years at successively larger locations and now owner of its own building, offers free initialing and gift-wrapping on mostly domestic wellknown brands of luggage, attache cases and personal leather goods. The luggage, briefcases, envelopes and attache cases all are discounted at 25 percent off suggested retail prices, unless otherwise marked down by greater margins as styles change or lines are discontinued.

Merchandise other than luggage is reduced 20 percent from manufacturer's suggested prices on all items of more than $2, including desk accessories, barometers, calculators, shaving kits, pen-and-pencil sets, key cases, travel clocks and elastic clothes lines, wallets and jewelry from Swank, Pierre Cardin, Hallmark, Mark Cross, Pegasus, Buxton and Prince Gardner. A mustache set of miniature brush, comb and scissors could be a gift for an usher or a graduate. A bootjack, formerly $12.50, now $10, might suit someone with no one at home to help tug them off. When in doubt, a gift certificate saves pondering."
1981-05-10	TANDOORI ENTREES IN ELEGANT SETTING	WHEN Sitar opened in Melville in 1978, it was astonishing. Imagine a large, beautiful Indian restaurant built from the ground up on Route 110 surrounded by stretches of office buildings and banks, not exactly a hub of fine dining. Yet Sitar, with its traditional clay tandoor oven, could be compared favorably with some of Manhattan's better Indian restaurants. It still can. Sitar seems to have weathered the test of time well. The dinner menu maintains its commitment to the Mogul cuisine of northern India, and the food is consistently satisfying. One never tires of the restaurant's alluring elegance. The entrance, through massive doors, leads to a polished marble reception area beyond which, up a few steps, is the serene dining room. Tables along the walls are separated by canopied alcoves of carved wood and wellspaced tables fill the center of the room. An authentic 14th-century temple carving covers the rear wall, and carved wooden mythological plaques decorate the other walls. The general level of illumination is subdued.
1981-05-10	Dining Out; A MENU WITH ORIGINALITY	GREENWICH THE space was familiar - the small two-level dining room at the Gryphon Cafe, with its oak tables, free-standing palms, hanging plants, and abstract paintings all bore a certain similarity to many of the restaurants that have opened in Connecticut in the past two years. But to our considerable surprise and pleasure the Gryphon Cafe had a menu with more than a spark of originality. There were 10 entrees on the dinner menu, but usually there are several additional daily specials. Many of the dishes have a decidedly Oriental touch -escallops of tenderloin with Sichuan black bean sauce, Indonesia lemon duck, fresh bay scallops Chinoise, satay of tenderloin Calcutta, boneless breast of chicken Mandarin - but some are more traditionally French, such as sirloin bernaise, chicken Grenobloise.
1981-05-03	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Craft Supplies At Stratford"	"Stratford Craft Supplies draws wholesale as well as retail customers from as far away as New York City. Craft groups representing all ages and skills show up month after month for supplies, with prices reduced for quantity purchases or the 13th item free.

For macrame addicts, the store has beads, including wood; rings of metal, plastic, bamboo and wood in assorted sizes; and washable, nonfading acrylic or polyester cord - no cotton. Jewelry beads and beading threads (including silver and gold lame threads for crocheted jewelry and gold, silver and white elastic) are right alongside beading pins and plastic pearls by the yard for wedding gowns. Small bags of faceted plastic beads are 79 cents for 100; the middle-size packet is $2.50 for 480 pieces; and the greatest bargain is in the 10 gross quantity, $7.05 for 1440 beads."
1981-05-03	THE SETTING ENHANCES THE FOOD	MERELY walking through the door of the Old Inlet Inn in Bellport is appealing. The restaurant is situated in a gracious white Victorian house that was built in 1890. On July 4, 1980, it was included in the National Register of Historic Places. The back of the menu is devoted to an explanation of the name Old Inlet - an area of Fire Island opposite Bellport where there was once a private beach club, the Old Inlet Club. It is odd that nothing is stated about the history of the actual premises of the restaurant, but, according to Stephanie Bigelow, the local historian, it was a residence built by a member of the Osborn family - a family that first came to Bellport in the 18th century.
1981-05-03	SATISFYING OFFERINGS IN GLASTONBURY	GLASTONBURY WITH its white-frame exterior and low ceiling, multiroom colonialstyle interior, the Blacksmith's Tavern looks as though it would be more at home in a restored village such as Old Sturbridge, rather than in its actual location on the main street of Glastonbury. The six small dining rooms have similar decor: salmon-colored tablecloths, green-patterned wallpaper, fresh flowers and hurricane glass chimneys over candles on all tables, cut-glass water goblets and baskets full of plants on the windowsills. The rooms are attractive without much sparkle of originality. The first glance at the menu suggests much the same thing. Of 18 entrees listed, most are restaurant standards: veal cordon bleu, veal Oscar, tenderloin of beef Wellington, scallopine of veal Marsala, baked stuffed shrimp.
1981-05-03	Mail-Order House Opens Its Warehouse	Lillian Vernon, the Mount Vernon gift store and mail-order business, will begin its inventory clearance Thursday evening at the Port Chester Warehouse with prices at wholesale or below, hourly additions and the Retinitis Pigmentosis Foundation receiving 10 percent of the proceeds. Be warned - last year's first clearance jammed the parking lot and surrounding streets. No credit cards; only cash or checks.

1981-05-02	Your Money; Credit Cards: A New Battle	DESPITE the proliferation of credit cards, no one has been able to usurp the American Express card's stronghold in the travel and entertainment market. Now, the two leading bank cards, MasterCard and Visa, used primarily for retail sales, are preparing an assault on the grandfather card's dominion. The American Express card has always distinguished itself from Visa and MasterCard by allowing its holders no spending limit. With the bank cards, as one analyst noted, a consumer always faced the embarrassing possibility of reaching the credit limit and being turned down for a purchase.
1981-04-28	VISA SEEKS MONEY FUNDS FOR BANKS	Visa USA is planning to offer commercial banks across the country the opportunity to offer their customers money market mutual funds, a top Visa executive said yesterday. In a letter to senior executives of the 1,200 banks that issue Visa credit cards, Charles T. Russell, president of Visa USA, said the purpose of the money market fund program was to help banks compete against financial conglomerates. The letter specifically cited the proposed acquisition of Shearson Loeb Rhoades Inc., the nation's second-largest securities firm, by the American Express Company. Many securities firms sponsor money market mutual funds, and the proposed acquisition would enable American Express, a Visa competitor, to enter the business.
1981-04-26	"Dining Out;
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS IN ARMONK"	"FIVE years ago, Flower Dragon in Armonk was a delightful and welcome addition to Northern Westchester's paucity of Chinese restaurants; in fact, it is still a gastronomical landmark of some distinction, if erratic. And although stiff competition in this cuisine thrives farther south, Flower Dragon remains almost without serious alternatives in the county's northern region. The restaurant's isolation is both lucky and unlucky for neighborhood residents - lucky to have a good Chinese restaurant within striking distance; unlucky to be obliged to pay somewhat higher prices for food that can be inconsistent in quality. After sampling about 40 dishes from the extensive menu, we must report that the hand that stir-fries the wok cannot always be relied upon.

On one of our recent visits, the kitchen gave a superb performance, fully two-star. That night, spiciness and selected ingredients provided adventures in nuance with every dish. It is regrettable, therefore, that on our five other visits the kitchen did not maintain so high a standard, and even their best dishes rarely achieved the same success."
1981-04-26	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Outdoor Gear Discounted At Fairfield Trading Post"	"Spring fever has prompted one reader to recommend a favorite source of outdoor equipment, the Fairfield Trading Post, opened in 1956. It calls itself a ''supermarket of marine and camping supplies'' with discounts of 20 to 40 percent.

If getting a boat in shape is a priority, anti-fouling copper bottom paint that lists at $49.99 sells here at $29.99, and there are 23 sizes of boat storage covers, in case this year finished off the current model. A two-man rubberized boat for getting back to shore after the boat has been tied up, usually $120, now sells for $79.99, including a separate air pump, oars and safety rope. A vinyl inflatable boat that can hold three adults sells for $36.99."
1981-04-26	DINING OUT	IS IT A RESTAURANT OR SIMPLY A DINER? By VALERIE SINCLAIR THE THREE SISTERS, which is next to the Two Guys shopping center on Route 46 in Dover, is in an area that is not known for good restaurants. But the recommendations we received from readers, and the fact that the restaurant has been around for 30 years, made it worth checking into. The Three Sisters is attractive and seems to be popular both with couples and businessmen. But although the menu is large and offers many interesting-sounding dishes, the quality of the cooking is of the standard that one would expect to find in a diner, rather than a fine restaurant.
1981-04-26	Marimekko Linens A Buy in Larchmont	Postcards have gone out to customers on a pair of sales at the newly renovated Motif Designs in Larchmont. The first is a closeout sale that drops prices on Marimekko comforters, sheets, pillowcases and towels 50 to 75 percent off suggested retail prices. The second, which begins May 28 and ends June 15, is the annual window-treatment sale at 40 percent off catalogue prices on Levelors, verticals, woodweaves, balloons and Austrian, Roman and laminated shades. Lyn Peterson, president of Motif, is co-designer of Marimekko's wallcovering collections Nos. 1 and 2, as the books are numbered so far; those coverings remain at the usual discounted prices. There are 3,000 pieces of bedding, including styles for children, cut to below the wholesale prices so that the four-year-old interior decorating shop can completely clear the stock of handscreened-in-Finland designs manufactured here by Dan River.
1981-04-24	Restaurants; Friendly trattoria, Korean informality.	WITH so many restaurateurs nowadays copying one another's dishes that ''sell,'' Trastevere gives much cause for celebration. Opened seven months ago on 83d Street just east of Second Avenue by Maurizio and Paul Lattanzi, brothers from Rome who have worked in local Italian restaurants, and their mother, Erminia, who oversees the kitchen, this tiny, rustic and friendly trattoria has quickly developed a style of its own. The Lattanzis have managed to avoid culinary cliches by using authoritative seasonings and original presentations and it makes one think that nouvelle-cuisine Italianstyle is not far off. Not for the faint-palated are the lusty accents of garlic and herbs in dishes such as the linguine with a briny, parsley flecked white clam sauce or in any of the wonderful seafood preparations adrift in a peppery, garlic-laden tomato broth. This fragrant tomato brodetto does as much for the appetizer of shiny black mussels as it does for such main courses as the mixed fish and seafood (zuppa de pesce) or the calamari Trastevere, thoughtfully underlined with thick toasted bread slices to absorb the heady sauce. Of these seafood dishes, only the zuppa de pesce, served in an undersized bowl, is somewhat difficult to maneuver.
1981-04-22	CITICORP REGISTERS 16.9% GAIN IN PERIOD	Citicorp yesterday reported a 16.9 percent rise in its net operating earnings for the first quarter of 1981, but the gain was from an unusually low level of profitability in the quarter a year earlier, when earnings declined 34 percent below the previous year's level. In answer to a shareholder's question at Citicorp's annual meeting yesterday, Walter B. Wriston, chairman, declared that the ''company is in a good state.'' Richard A. Freytag, vice president in charge of investor relations, attributed the low level of earnings to funding decisions taken in the third quarter last year, when Citicorp expected interest rates to decline. But rates rose sharply, and Citicorp had to pay far more than it had expected to finance the loans and investments it had put on its books in the third quarter. ''That's been very painful,'' Mr. Freytag said. He added that most of the short-term investments made in the third quarter had ended and that part of the problem had been solved.
1981-04-20	Advertising; Travelers Check Campaign	WHEN you see that palomino stallion on the television screen running beautifully through the surf and along a grassy plain on behalf of the new MasterCard Travelers Cheques, it will be the work of the William Esty Company. The long-time agency for MasterCard last October assigned three different creative teams to come up with the advertising for the new checks. Having been briefed by the client on broad strategy, basic positioning and the situation in the marketplace, they came back three weeks later with a bushel basket of concepts that were winnowed down to 10, which were put onto storyboards - sort of comic strip scripts for commercials. From there, five ideas survived another review.
1981-04-19	Nonfiction in Brief	CRITICAL PATH By R. Buckminster Fuller. With the assistance of Kiyoshi Kuromiya. Illustrated. 471 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $15.95. A man of science can't very well write that ''by 1985 we should be able to transmit humans around the globe by radio scanning or an equivalently unexpected means'' without risking damage to his professional reputation. But Buckminster Fuller, the 85-year-old philosopher and polymath, bravely insists on utopia in this comprehensive statement of his philosophy. Instead of envisioning the Malthusian tragedy of resource exhaustion posed by the Club of Rome and others, Mr. Fuller suggests that ''technologically we now have four billion billionaires on board Spaceship Earth.'' All of us are kept ignorant of our good fortune by political, economic and religious systems that depend for their popularity on the false premise that we can do no more than accommodate ourselves to material limits. If only we would stop fighting over crumbs, according to Mr. Fuller, and take heed of the ''design science revolution,'' which has already brought unprecedented prosperity to much of the world, the epoch of competition will finally give way to one of co-operation, and nation shall not lift up sword against nation.
1981-04-19	Dining Out; LUNCH IN NEW HAVEN... CONTD.	WITH the opening of the Yale Center for British Art and with the Yale Repertory and Long Wharf Theaters going strong, New Haven has emerged over the last two years as a focal point for day trippers from all around the state. Some months ago we reviewed a number of restaurants in the city that make pleasant and satisfactory choices for lunch. Chapel Street, especially, seems to be turning into Restaurant Row. It is a handy location for both the Yale Rep and the Yale museums.
1981-04-16	Puerto Rico Credit Laws	Puerto Rico today ordered Citibank and two local banks to discontinue by April 27 their practice of charging annual user fees for credit cards. The island consumer affairs department decreed that the annual charge by Citibank, Banco Popular and Bank of Ponce MasterCard and Visa credit cards violated Puerto Rico's interest and usury laws.
1981-04-12	"Dining Out;
FOOD AS WORTHY AS THE ATMOSPHERE"	"IT is always pleasant to return to what was once a potentially good restaurant to find that it is fulfilling that potential. In our review of Damiano's in Granite Springs more than a year ago, we lamented that it had everything a restaurant-goer could want, except good food. We can report that such is no longer the case; under the guidance of the new chef, Nicola Brunetti, the kitchen has at last become worthy of Damiano's atmosphere.

This restaurant has always been one of the handsomest in the county: soft candlelight reflected in glowing brass, thick carpeting, immaculately appointed tables each with a cheering arrangement of fresh flowers, cozy fire on chilly evenings and dining porch with woodland views for warmer seasons. Marie Damiano, the owner, has an eye for elegant detail. And most important for the restaurant, there is with the addition of the talented Signor Brunetti and the knowledgeable maitre d'hotel, Marcello Sili, and the old safe ''continental'' menu fortunately discarded, an exclusively Italian cuisine, purported to be regional but executed with what seems a Northern touch. The food at Damiano's not only is good, but also, on balance, evidences among the offerings a number of notable, three-star dishes."
1981-04-12	"The Careful Shopper;
Inventory Sale Is Sight For Sore Eyes"	"The Canal Street Plastic Supply Company in New Rochelle is hard to miss. Located south of the I-95 toll booth and painted purple and an orange-now-faded-to-salmon, it has a sign within saying ''We Don't Like the Color of Your House Either.''

In a different way this week's inventory sale is ''hard to miss'' - prices are 35 to 40 percent off suggested retail levels in the vast store that houses all manner of Lucite, Plexiglas and plastic gifts and housewares. Some items are made elsewhere and always discounted from 15 to 20 percent; some is first-quality Canal Street furniture crafted in the building and sold at outlet prices."
1981-04-12	"The Careful Shopper;
Furniture Bargains At Canal Street Plastic"	"This week only, there is a sale at 35 to 40 percent off suggested retail prices at Canal Street Plastic Supply Company in Stamford. It is also sale time at the Manhattan branch and at the New Rochelle factory (painted purple and orange-now-faded-to-salmon), south of the I-95 toll booth in Westchester.

The stock is all manner of Lucite, Plexiglas and plastic gifts and housewares, always discounted 15 to 20 percent, along with firstquality Canal Street furniture at outlet prices. Discontinued samples or seconds from Gary Strutin Ltd., a separate factory in New Rochelle that supplies the decorator trade with custom designs in Lucite, are periodically on hand at all stores, marked down considerably from the usual high cost of dining-room furniture and coffee tables."
1981-04-12	FOOD AND WINES FROM DOWN UNDER	WITH its yabbies from the Billabong, mimi birds, bundled chooks and carpetbag, merely reading the menu at the Australian Country Inn and Gardens in Northport is a vocabulary lesson. Some knowledge of Australian geography would be helpful, but translations are provided for those who do not speak the language. Except for a few unusual combinations such as steak stuffed with oysters (the carpetbag), it's familiar fare. Tasmanian shrimp cocktail with ruddy sauce is the regulation shrimp cocktail served in virtually every restaurant on the island.
1981-04-12	Dining Out; OLD BARN HOLDS PLEASANT SURPRISE	SOUTH WOODSTOCK COMING upon Bald Hill Restaurant in the wooded, somewhat underpopulated terrain of northeastern Connecticut is a little like stumbling upon a feast in the middle of the desert. Sparkling glassware, a pot of begonias on each table, comfortable rattan chairs, softly modulated lighting, nicely set tables covered with glass over red-and-green-patterned fabric, repeated in the draperies - all make the restored barn in which the restaurant is located an inviting, comfortable place to dine. The menu invites as well. It is a small one, with only four appetizers and nine entrees, but they are more interesting than the usual cordon bleu menu cliches of recent years. Most of the dishes offered are fairly uncomplicated, not demanding unusual virtuosity at the range. On the whole, we found that what the Bald Hill kitchen promises, it delivers.
1981-04-10	by Mimi Sheraton; North Italian and South Chinese.	JUST about one year old, Il Galletto on 34th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues, is a convenient and convivial North Italian restaurant worth remembering when visiting in the neighborhood. Just four blocks from Madison Square Garden, it is jammed at lunch, but only moderately crowded at dinner. The setting is simple and slightly formal, and more adequate lighting would lend a needed cheerful glow. A slight improvement in the ventilation would also be advisable, doing away with the sudden whiffs of Sterno that emanate from the cooking done in the dining room. But the most consistent flaw at Il Galletto is an unsure hand in the kitchen, resulting in seasonings that lack authority and character. There is also a tendency to put too much flour in the sauces and to overuse what tastes like corn oil.
1981-04-05	"The Careful Shopper;
Display of Fashions At Norwalk Outlet"	"Next Saturday at the Norwalk Factory Outlet Center in Connecticut, spring will be welcomed with fashion shows at noon, and 2 and 4 P.M.; on Sunday more fashions at noon and 4 P.M. There are nine discount outlets are open at the ground level; on the second floor, the Quoddy Moccasin Factory Outlet, Clothes Works and the Old Mill have opened.

Quoddy casual footwear in 300 styles, handcrafted and called ''the best of Maine,'' is sold at discounts of 25 or 30 percent off suggested retail price. The range covers moccasins, sandals, boating shoes and pile-lined and shearling-lined outerwear. Most is first quality with overruns and discontinued styles, or new styles being tried out, in great quantity. Quoddy Moccasin Factory Outlet accepts MasterCard, Visa and checks with identification. Returns or exchanges are possible with receipt. The telephone is (203) 866-2547."
1981-04-05	Dining Out; CHINESE FOOD IN A TASTEFUL SETTING; BY FLORENCE FABRICANT	UNLIKE some of the newer Chinese restaurants on the Island, Gold King, located in the premises formerly occupied by Bruce Ho's in Manhasset, has not attempted anything exciting or innovative. The menu essentially follows the lines of the typical neighborhood Chinese restaurant with a great many special and combination dinners, column A and column B selections and food that might be called Cantonese but is interpreted according to American tastes. The setting is a pleasant one. Pale beige walls are decorated with several attractive mural-like scenic paintings, the chairs are cane and light wood Breuer-style and the lighting is subdued. Service is attentive and accommodating.
1981-04-05	Dining Out; STONEHOUSE SERVES OLD-TIME DECOR	GREENWICH IN recent years, Greenwich has joined Westport as a Fairfield County town with a variety of interesting restaurants. New restaurants seem to open and thrive on a fairly regular basis. One of the recent additions is the Stonehouse, open since September. The restaurant's name is itself an apt description. The building's stone exterior was erected in 1908 and was allowed to become rundown. But a considerable amount of work - peeling off layers of paint and wallpaper - has produced one of the most elegantly simple establishments we have come across lately.
1981-03-29	"DINING OUT;
THE FROG PRINCE TAKES NEW FORM"	"WHEN The Frog Prince Proper opened in Scarsdale a scant year and a half ago to the fairy-tale motif of the straw that is spun into gold, the byword was ''transformation'' - from frog to prince, from noisy gas station to elegantly appointed restaurant, from simple, high-quality fresh raw ingredients to highly inventive dishes inspired by nouvelle French cuisine.

Although the restaurant is as attractive as it was since our enthusiastic review four months ago, more transformations have occurred - but in a general retreat from originality: the professional kitchen and dining room personnel, followers of the new French wave, have changed twice; the menu now offers fewer surprises for the adventurous palate; even the background music, once largely baroque, now consists of innocuous arrangements from the limbo of popular tunesmiths. But in all fairness, one should point out certain advantages of the new model. First of all, it is markedly less pricey, particularly on week nights, when it offers a fixed-price three-course dinner for $13.95. And for those who found the original Frog Prince too innovative, it might be comforting to discover more familiar fare listed on the menu. The restaurant's newest chef, Michael Braun, turns out some agreeable, inoffensive dishes, cautious renditions that, with a few exceptions, lacked conviction."
1981-03-29	"CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Town and Country Clothes For Women at Half-Price"	"Mabbett Mills Ltd., a retail store in Washington Depot for classic town and country clothes for women, has all winter wear reduced by half the regular price.

Donald Davies of Dublin self-belted shirtdresses - of lightweight Irish wool, most handwashable and in a wide range of solids, stripes, tweeds and checks - priced from $139 to $162 last fall and to be restocked in the $200 range next season, now sell for $68 to $81. The sizes are 4 to 16, with a few 18's."
1981-03-29	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Springtime Skiing And Tennis Goods"	"With prices going up winter after winter, one defensive measure is to buy at this year's prices with the bonus of seasonal markdowns. At the Pedigree Ski and Tennis Shop in White Plains, the reductions amount to 20 to 50 percent on selected merchandise.

Pedigree, long established as a sports shop on Quarropas Street, moved its ski business in July 1979 to the old Pix movie house on Mamaroneck Avenue, leaving the tennis merchandise at the first site.  This month, the stores merged again at the Mamaroneck Avenue location."
1981-03-29	Dining Out; ROBUST SAUCES ADAPTED FROM ITALY	THE charm of La Gondola in Williston Park is not immediately evident. What sets the small, fairly new Italian restaurant apart from so many ordinary places is the effort made with food and service. The two dining rooms are comfortable, with well-spaced tables that are properly set. It is doubtful, however, that the decorations resulted from conscious planning on someone's part. The swirling plaster applied above thin, shiny paneling, the garish lighting and the coat of orange paint on the ceiling seemed to be a haphazard attempt to add finish to the interior without incurring great expense. The setting is best ignored.
1981-03-27	Restaurants; by Mimi Sheraton; New, already packed and promising.	ALTHOUGH the two restaurants reviewed this week are newcomers, the publicity connected with their opening activities has stirred enormous interest among restaurant buffs. The nine-week-old Marylou's in Greenwich Village, and Simon's, which opened in the Lincoln Center area about six weeks ago, are playing to packed houses almost nightly, an early flush of success that apparently has caused much confusion among kitchen and dining room staffs. Those who delight in reconnoitering the latest ''hot'' restaurants will be pleased to know both of these show considerable promise and that each already rates a single star. But those who demand professional performances when paying professional prices, would do better to wait until the managements get a firmer grip on their operations. Marylou's, on Ninth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, is on the garden floor of a wide brownstone formerly occupied by the Penguin. The premises have been turned into three graceful, romantically handsome dining rooms hung with kitsch paintings. Only the intense noise when tables are full, complicated by piped-in music and insufficient ventilation, mar the effect.
1981-03-22	"The Careful Shopper;
Designers Outlet Opens Shop in Rye"	"Designers first opened in Stratford, Conn., seven years ago, calling itself ''an elegant outlet'' for discounted major designer and name-brand fashions for women. A second shop was opened in the Stamford site vacated by Franklin Simon's in 1980.

Now a third has appeared, all mirrored and glittering, in the Town of Rye in the Washington Park Plaza, catering to Westchester customers who had traveled to the original stores. Sizes range from 2 through 16, and there are also petites. Selections must be made carefully because all sales are final."
1981-03-22	"The Careful Shopper;
Footwear Store Opens At Outlet Center"	"At the Norwalk Factory Outlet Center, all the stores at the ground level except one are open. The Quoddy Moccasin Factory Outlet opened last weekend on the second level. The nearby hammering and sawing continues to provide additional space for women's clothing at Jack Winter's Clothes Works and the Old Mill, each, by the way, seeking sales help before openings the first week of next month. The center's Spring Fashion Show and Festival will be April 11-12.

Quoddy casual footwear in 300 styles for the whole family, handcrafted and called ''the best of Maine''; socks, and polishes are sold at discounts of 25 or 30 percent off the suggested prices. The range also covers sandals, boating shoes and pile-lined and shearling-lined outerwear. Most is first quality with overruns and discontinued styles or new styles being tried out."
1981-03-22	Dining Out; PLEASANT FARE AT BARGAIN PRICES	BRANFORD THE Bittersweet Cafe, a tiny, unpretentious restaurant, is one of a number of enterprises that form Bittersweet Farm, a cluster of shingle-sided buildings housing potters, woodworkers and other artisans. The rainbow is the decorating motif at Bittersweet Cafe and a rainbow soft sculpture dominates one entire wall. There are rainbow decals and paintings and at lunch even the tables have a rainbow touch with lilac-colored tablecloths and red, yellow, blue and green paper napkins. At first glance at the menu, it would seem that the house specialty is avocado. Listed are avocado cheddar beefburger, avocado stuffed with tuna salad, avocado Frenchman's Cove (seafood in a Mornay sauce, baked in an avocado), omelet filled with avocado and guacamole. In spite of this monomania, at one lunch we were advised that there were no avocados that day.
1981-03-15	"The Careful Shopper;
Working With Fabrics For Home Decorating"	"Rosemarte Inc., a year-old Stamford company at a site known for four years as Harbour Point, supplies custom orders to home decorators and stores. Rosemary Horsting, the owner, whose experience in the business began 20 years ago in Georgia, has opened the Company Store to sell surplus wares to the public. There is a Thursday-to-Saturday schedule at prices 40 percent off a department store's charge.

The hand-outlined quilting - say around a floral pattern or animal outline - is done in the factory, not sent abroad. An interior decorator advises on style or fabric selection, perhaps including a house call for measurements on orders for draperies, upholstery, slipcovers, comforters, bedspreads, bolsters, fabric shower curtains or table skirts."
1981-03-15	"The Careful Shopper;
Some Gift Sales Go Unheralded"	"The Studio for Your Gifts has no mailing list for sales because it may be just a whim on a particular day to cut prices. It may also be a special occasion, such as the celebration of the first year at the Palmer Avenue location in Larchmont, with a two-week 20 percent-off sale for selected merchandise, beginning today.

The sale includes the fabric accessories that the shop also supplies to the Morgan Library Gift Shop, Henri Bendel's, Cache-Cache, Lilly Pulitzer and Bergdorf's, made with the customer's own fabric or selected from a full assortment at the shop. Custom fabric orders cost 15 percent more because of the complexities of dealing with unusual weaves, bias cuts or porous textures. During the sale, therefore, the custom work more closely resembles the ordinary stock prices of $20 for a photo album with two fillers; umbrella stand, $17.50; looseleaf, $12.50; blotter, $10.50 in the most popular size; wastebasket, $10; legal pads, $8.50; flat tissue box, $7.50; pencil cup, $7, and address book, $6.50."
1981-03-15	Dining Out; AN EMPHASIS ON NOUVELLE CUISINE	COS COB JARDINE'S, a new restaurant in Cos Cob, advertises ''elegant waterfront dining,'' and the multi-windowed, two-tiered interior facing the Mianus River is attractive. The ground floor dining room is a stylish and comfortable combination of polished brass railings, big picture windows and dark wood-paneled walls. Large sculptural plants, strategically placed, embellish configurations that give considerable privacy. A large bar, really a step-down ''conversation pit,'' is next to, but separated from, the dining area, with sound containment that keeps the bar chatter from reverberating through the dining space. Up a winding staircase, the second floor is also pleasing, though some patrons might not appreciate the disco-type flashing lights that are really not in keeping with the rest of the decor. Jardine's is owned by the same group that owns Boodle's in Greenwich, but the menu is considerably different. Consisting of 10 appetizers and 12 entrees, it emphasizes nouvelle cuisine. Nouvelle cuisine, with a nod to oriental cooking techniques, highlights al dente vegetable preparation and the use of lighter sauces. The art of a Paul Bocuse, one of the pioneers of this style, is in audaciously combining unlikely ingredients in a tour de force that works.
1981-03-09	SENATE TO CONSIDER CREDIT CARD FEES	Amid mounting opposition, the Senate this week will consider legislation that would extend a ban on charging credit card users an extra fee when they use their cards. The legislation passed the House with little opposition several weeks ago, but questions have now arisen about who would benefit from the surcharge ban, which expired Feb. 28. Currently, merchants pay a 3 percent to 5 percent fee to the card issuer for each credit card purchase. This cost, an estimated $1.5 billion in 1980, is passed along indirectly in the price of goods to both credit card and cash customers.
1981-03-08	HOW TO GET MONEY FAST	Y OU'VE had a big dinner at an expensive restaurant. The captain delivers the bill and you discover that you didn't bring enough cash. The restaurant, alas, does not accept credit cards, so what do you do? Today, you can rush out to a nearby bank, plug your credit card into a machine and withdraw more than enough cash to cover the bill. Over the last dozen years, the leading bank credit cards - MasterCard, Visa and some others - have become remarkably flexible tools for doing a lot more than purchasing merchandise. Among other things, they have liberated the consumer from his reliance on the local bank branch or the check-cashing service of the supermarket to raise cash in a hurry.
1981-03-08	The Careful Shopper; by Jeanne Clare Feron; Clinton Tableware Expands Outlet	D. Clarkson Ltd., a manufacturing wholesaler in Clinton, has supplied major department stores in several dozen states in the last four and a half years. The factory produces tablecloths, runners, placemats and napkins designed to complement both contemporary china and earthenware in easy-care and soil-release fabrics under the name Table Accents by Deborah. The owners tried tag sales for overruns, closeouts and discontinued styles and, by 1979, were conducting annual sales prior to Christmas in an outlet store near the factory. As the product reputation has grown, mostly by word of mouth, the hours have grown to regular openings each Friday and Saturday. Beginning this June, there will be daily hours, except Sunday.
1981-03-08	The Careful Shopper; by Jeanne Clare Feron; Selection of Closeouts On Leather Goods	Gallery of Closeouts, on Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains, has discounted leather goods, soft luggage, desk accessories, jewelry and permanent-press tablecloths and placemats. There are the ubiquitous designer names on some accessories, umbrellas, belts and luggage. There are no seconds. The cost-cutting at the six-month-old shop is because it purchases closeouts, with discounts depending on the merchandise. Nothing is sold at the prices suggested by manufacturers. Jewelry is 33 to 40 percent off.
1981-03-08	Dining Out; ELEGANT TOUCHES TO PLEASE THE EYE	FAIRFIELD WHEN Fredericksburg opened a year or so ago, it proved an unusual and delightful restaurant, both in the quality of its food offerings and in the novelty of its setting. The main dining room is designed to resemble a village green with skylight overhead to suggest openair dining. Surrounding the ''green'' are colonial-style ''houses.'' Inside two of these are additional, more intimate dining rooms. A third, called the Governor's Palace, opened several months ago. The name alone suggests this might be something different from Fredericksburg's regular dining rooms. And indeed it is. Though you enter from the ''green,'' and throughout dinner can hear the live music wafting in from one end of the ''green,'' the enclosed room has a different staff, all in white gloves, and a different, more ambitious seven-course menu, price fixed at $35 a person.
1981-03-06	Restaurants; by Mimi Sheraton; Good south Italian, Broadway landmark.	IF New Yorkers are fortunate in having a rapidly growing list of excellent and fashionable restaurants featuring the elegant cuisine of northern Italy, they may be paying a price by having lost most of the simple, casual and dependable neighborhood restaurants that served the more familiar dishes of southern Italy. The simpler restaurants with their familiar if less fashionable southern fare cannot command the prices that enable owners to meet rising costs. One southern Italian restaurant that has managed to remain successful, however, is Joe's on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village. Lunch at this 40-year-old landmark is relaxed and easygoing and, though noisy at dinner, the spirit is always convivial. Some of the food served in the trim, unpretentious modern dining rooms could certainly be classified as excellent. Over-all, however, the kitchen strikes a very good, solid average, and the dining room staff is friendly, thoroughly professional and helpful.
1981-03-02	Senate to Vote on Credit Fees	The Senate is expected to act Tuesday on legislation that would continue a ban on extra charges for credit card purchases. The bill, sponsored by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, would continue a five-year ban on charging credit card customers an extra fee on each purchase.
1981-03-01	The Careful Shopper; by Jeanne Clare Feron; Kitchen Equipment And a Lot More	The Cook's Corner, a division of Food Equipment Systems Inc., is more than a retail source for kitchen gifts in Chappaqua. It is a place to revel in opportunities for careful preparation and thoughtful presentation of all those inevitable meals, and especially for group cooking. Leonard Stern, owner of Food Equipment Systems, supplies executive dining rooms and corporate kitchens from headquarters in Chappaqua, and Harmony Stern supervises the retail business, which can therefore pass along the advantages of bulk buying and the elimination of any middleman. For starters, you can pick up a restaurant range - ''heavy-duty, rugged, dependable and versatile,'' the South Bend Range Corporation brochure confidently states - mentioning also the six burners, griddle broiler and two ovens. At 25 percent off the supply house's list price, it comes to $1,800 delivered and ready for installation.
1981-03-01	Careful Shopper; by Jeanne Clare Feron; Extra Markdowns At Danbury Outlet	Shoppers have become used to the Grand Fashion Outlet in Danbury in the last 10 years. They expect to find a limited range of sportswear discounted by one-third or more at a location open only three days a week and the first Saturday of each month. Until mid-March there is an extra markdown of 20 percent on fall and winter items. Customers don't anticipate huge shipments of spring lines or cruise clothes from name designers. Instead they come for the periodically available products of the factory to the back of the building and of job lots and closeouts that arrive unheralded - sweaters for men and women, jumpers, polyester jackets and slacks.
1981-02-27	Restaurants; by Mimi Sheraton; North Italian fare and a brasserie.	NEXT to moving its location, the most trying test for a wellestablished restaurant is a change of chefs. By all indications, based on recent visits, Salta in Bocca, on Madison Avenue between 33d and 34th Streets, has weathered just such a change and during the last four months has exhibited no evidence of disruption in the kitchen's performance, a tribute to the experience and diligence of its owner, Fulvio Tramontina. Since it opened four and a half years ago, this simply decorated, pleasant north Italian restaurant with its rose-glow walls and its abundance of candy-box oil paintings has been mobbed at lunch by business people in the area. The noise and pace at that time of day are frantic and dizzying. But at night, things calm down to an easygoing hum, and on Friday and Saturday nights, when the neighborhood virtually shuts down, Salta in Bocca is an uncrowded and comfortable find, a place worth remembering for a leisurely and elegantly satisfying meal. Service is both friendly and professional, a combination that comes as something of a relief compared with the many dining rooms where the staffs are often friendly but unpolished. Here captains and waiters actually understand the food they are serving. And if anyone wants a dish that deviates a bit from the menu norm, it is readily provided.
1981-02-23	CREDIT BUYERS' FEE STIRS DEBATE	Amid protests from consumer groups and the Federal Trade Commission, Congress is to consider legislation this week that would extend a ban on charging credit card customers an extra fee when they use their cards. The ban expires Friday. Merchants now pay a 3 percent to 5 percent fee to the card issuer for each credit card purchase. This cost, which amounted to an estimated $1.5 billion in 1980, is passed along indirectly in the price of goods to both credit card and cash customers.
1981-02-23	HEAD OF BENEFICIAL UNIT	Joseph N. Scarpinato, 36, has been appointed president of the Peoples Credit Company, the subsidiary of the Beneficial Corporation that operates its Visa and MasterCard services, effective next Monday. He will succeed Dale Taylor, 34, who resigned his post at the Wilmington, Del., company.
1981-02-22	"The Careful Shopper;
Out of Salem, Mass., Comes Chinoiserie"	"With China a matter of so much interest these days, it seems only fitting that a Salem, Mass., supplier of hand-crafted and handpainted furniture with Oriental scenes and floral designs should open a regional outlet to serve heightened interest in chinoiserie furniture in the New York City area. Katherine Henick originals - each piece bears the name - have been available only through decorators' showrooms or at the factory for the last 40 years.

The Katherine Henick Furniture Outlet opened on Irvington Street in Pleasantville last November with a display of both the chinoiserie and the studio's French provincial styles at one-third off the retail price. The company's goal is to have a total of four outlets -Salem for the Boston area, Palm Beach and Atlanta to be established later on - and to eliminate the traditional sales pattern, according to Frank Paradise, who took over from Miss Henick in 1980."
1981-02-22	Dining Out; INVITING ATMOSPHERE IN FORMER CLUB	NEW HAVEN THE setting at Sherman's Taverne is so convivial that one is tempted to linger, especially on chill winter evenings. The dining room is stylish and attractive any time of year, but it is at its best at night when the crystal chandelier, imposing hearth, dark wood paneling, mirrored wall, arched stained-glass windows, and flickering candles on each table provide a romantic backdrop for dinner. The restaurant is approximately three years old, but for many years the building housed the Union League Club. The accouterments, including a grand staircase and marble pillars, give it a comfortable club look. A plaque on the ornately carved mantel states that the ''club stands on the home lot where Roger Sherman lived and where he entertained George Washington in 1789.''
1981-02-20	LIVELY STEAKHOUSE, CELEBRITY HANGOUT; by Mimi Sheraton; Lively steakhouse, celebrity hangout.	ANYONE who is bothered by noise will be especially unhappy at Auctions, an otherwise stylish and appealing little bar and steakhouse that opened three months ago at the corner of Third Avenue and 80th Street. But not everyone is disturbed by noise and there are some people who even thrive on it, judging by the three-deep crowd at the bar most evenings and the full house that convenes in the adjacent cafe-dining room. Even after so short a trial period, expansion plans are already under way. Both the name and decor of this restaurant derive from its location in the heart of auction country. Walls papered with the brilliantly colorful pages of auction house catalogues are in sparkling contrast to mirrored panels and a white ceiling. With just 36 seats so far, the small dining room is pleasantly casual, as is the service for the most part. Only occasionally is the tone marred by a waiter who is curt and contentious.
1981-02-15	"The Careful Shopper;
Coat Clearances At Dress Barn Chain"	"Dress Barn is a women's apparel chain with 34 branches, including those called Clothes Barn in New Jersey. This year at least 10 more are planned there, in Massachussetts and in Connecticut. Most of the 17 stores in this state are in Fairfield County. There are four in Westchester and one in Putnam County.

Central buying helps each to offer 20 to 50 percent off nationally advertised prices continuously, with seasonal clearances and promotions meaning additional savings. A Washington's Birthday down and polyfill coat promotion, for instance, has prices 33 percent off those previously marked. The labels are from known department store suppliers."
1981-02-15	"Dining Out;
CHOOSING DISHES FROM NAPLES NORTH"	"ONE of the first restaurants visible from the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway as one crosses into Westchester is Venezia di Notte in Yonkers. The place is certainly noticeable: its facade features a large illuminated map of Italy, the most famous cities marked by light bulbs. The enchanting name implies promise of northeastern specialties like rissoto, polenta, tripe and fish; we looked forward to our visits. But disappointments are all the keener when expectations run high, and we were disenchanted rather frequently here, not only in the few northern dishes offered but in others besides.

By being very choosy, one can, nevertheless, select a passable dinner from the 100 or so dishes on the menu. These include the usual numbers from as far south as Naples and some that are not traditional Italian dishes at all. One of the best entrees, for instance, was a towering prime filet mignon ''alla Mario Lanza,'' accompanied by an overly intense marsala sauce best left in the boat, even though it was thick with fresh sliced mushrooms. And one can be assured of fresh lobster from a tank. (Although, after much discussion with our waiter about boiling or steaming, the lobster arrived broiled.)"
1981-02-15	"The Careful Shopper;
70-to-80% Saving On Winter Apparel"	"During February, prices are cut by 70 to 80 percent nearly storewide on women's first-quality winter apparel at Gilbert Vincents in Ossining - except on belts, scarves and lingerie. Antique and contemporary jewelry is reduced 20 percent. The usual initial saving is up to 50 percent, although some merchandise begins at the manufacturer's suggested retail price.

The clearout of winter wares is an opportunity to pick up a suede bag for $19; a Beene bag for $29; Amalfi, Evins or Golo shoes from $25 to $60; a tweed jacket for $49, lined trousers $29; dungarees at $9, down from $40; or silk blouses from $19 to $29. The size range is 4 to 14."
1981-02-15	Dining Out; CHINESE, AND IT'S ALL SEAFOOD	ABOUT two months ago, Secret Sea, one of the most unusual Chinese restaurants in the New York area and quite possibly in the entire country, opened in Manhasset. It is a Chinese seafood restaurant. There are Cantonese restaurants in New York's Chinatown that are known for seafood, but none are committed to serving fish and seafood exclusively, like Secret Sea. With the exception of several vegetable dishes, the only alternatives on the menu are one beef entree and one chicken entree.
1981-02-13	BANKS AND RETAILERS REPORT HIGH LOSSES ON CONSUMER LOANS	Losses on consumer loans have increased sharply at banks, finance companies and retailers around the country. As a result, many of these institutions are cutting back on credit to individuals, an informal check with the creditors shows. Individuals in the lowerincome brackets, and those who do not own real estate that can be used as collateral, may find it especially difficult to obtain credit. James A. Matthews, vice president of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, the nation's seventhlargest bank, said that ''consumers might have to use credit more judiciously.'' It might be necessary to return to the way of living of the 1950's, he continued, when people ''had a healthy attitude toward credit.''
1981-02-08	"The Careful Shopper;
An Informal Shop Under Movie House"	"Thru the Garage Ltd. - behind and, in fact, under the State Cinema in the Springdale section of Stamford - has women's sportswear and dresses, sizes 2 to 14, discounted by 25 percent or more. The merchandise is all first quality, with low overhead and direct buying from manufacturers accounting for the cut prices, according to the owners.

A midday caller recently found the sales help at a round table sharing salmon mousse, crackers and diet drinks, with shoppers invited to indulge. Once used to the casual ambiance of the nineyear-old shop, some customers return with their own brown-bag lunches."
1981-02-08	"The Careful Shopper;
Clearance on Items From the British Isles"	"The mailing-list notices are out for Dickens of London's clearance in Mamaroneck. It is not ordinarily an off-price shop, but the markdowns during the rest of the month start at 30 percent on men's and women's first-quality apparel and accessories. Reductions go to considerably beyond 50 percent on pale stripings in silk shirtwaist dresses, down from $165 to $65, and in cotton, down from $115 to $35, by Stephens Bros. of London and made in Ireland.

The imports are mostly from the British Isles, with some from Canada. The sizes are 8 to 14, with a few 6's and 16's. Wool, cotton and silk means that ironing is required in some cases and in others that the item requires dry cleaning."
1981-02-08	Dining Out; SEAFOOD IN A PLEASANT SETTING	EPICUREAN in Great Neck is a place to keep in mind for casual seafood dinners in a pleasant setting. Actually, the wood-paneled dining room, with its softened lighting provided by glittery but effective modern chandeliers and its tables covered with spotless napery and adorned with fresh flowers, is fairly elegant. The walls are not strung with netting, as in the usual seafood restaurant. But the management does not require jackets for male patrons, jeans are permitted, and a relaxed tone prevails. The restaurant is Greek-owned, evidenced by subdued background music dominated by the theme from ''Never on Sunday,'' as well as by a few Greek specialties on the menu. For the most part, however, the food is typical of a basic seafood menu with some Italian dishes for good measure. Fresh fish, shrimp, clams, lobster tails and lobsters broiled, baked, fried and stuffed comprise the majority of selections. The cooking is generally competent, with simpler preparations preferable to elaborate ones and broiled fish dishes outshining the fried ones.
1981-02-08	Dining Out; ECLECTIC DINER OF GREEK HERITAGE	NORWALK THE word ''diner'' connotes an around-the-clock eatery, more often than not a truck stop. But anyone visiting the new Silver Star Restaurant-Diner expecting the classic long counter with a few booths is in for culture shock. The Silver Star is like no other diner we've seen. More like Hollywood-on-the-Post Road, this million-dollar creation is a melange of travertine marble, stainless steel and chrome with a few eclectic touches that reflect the Greek heritage of its operators, the Savvidis brothers - Andreas, Anastasios and Alexandros.
1981-02-07	Your Money; Saving Charges On Credit Cards	THE credit-card war in the New York area has been heating up as three banks have decided to buck the general trend and not charge an annual fee on their MasterCard and Visa credit cards. This has enhanced the consumer's ability to shop for credit-card bargains. Giving up one card for another has no effect on an individual's credit rating, bankers say. The big question for consumers is whether the saving is worth the bother of making a switch from one card-issuing bank to another. Aside from the annual fees, some banks have imposed higher interest rates than others. The effect of the interest-rate differentials would vary depending on the extent to which a consumer borrows against his cards.
1981-02-07	The Economy	The U.S. unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.4 percent last month, indicating that the economy was stronger than expected. The number of employed workers rose by 414,000, while unemployment rose by 62,000. (Page 1.) In New York City, the unemployment rate rose to 8.8 percent in January from 7.7 percent. (8.) A new glut in world oil supplies may be developing with consuming nations reducing consumption, and Iran and Iraq resuming exports. By summer, according to officials of Western governments and oil companies, more crude oil may be available than needed. The price of oil on the spot market has fallen to about $37 a barrel, about the same as that sold under contract by OPEC. Analysts in New York said recent price increases for gasoline and heating oil reflected OPEC's last round of increases and domestic decontrol. (1.)
1981-02-06	Village Spanish and exotic TriBeCa.	CONSIDERING the current rage for seafood and the equal interest in finding bargains, the popularity of Cafe Espanol on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village is easy to understand. For, though most of the selections on the Spanish and Mexican menus leave much to be desired, there are several savory and satisfying appetizers and copious seafood main courses that are exceptional buys. Add to that the snug and engaging adobe hacienda setting and the friendly, concerned and generally efficient staff, and you have the makings of a pleasant dinner, especially before or after Off Broadway theater. Start with the tequila-based margarita, which has just the right limy, salty pungency, and between sips, nibble on freshly warmed taco chips dipped into hot sauce, or the onion-scented guacamole, which can be ordered as an appetizer. Then if you restrict your choices to what the house does best, you'll go on to just about a two-star meal. The overall rating, however, is one star because all the meat dishes, and most chicken and Mexican specialties, are not good enough to be considered bargains, even at such low prices.
1981-02-04	CHAINS LIFT CREDIT RATE	Macy's New York, the state's largest retailer, yesterday said it would increase its annual interest rate on revolving credit accounts to 19.8 percent from 18 percent, or to 1.65 percent monthly from 1.5 percent. The company's 17 stores from New York City to the Albany area are said to serve more than a million charge accounts. Two other major retailers, Sears, Roebuck & Company of Chicago and Montgomery Ward, a subsidiary of the Mobil Corporation and also of Chicago, said they were increasing interest charges on revolving credit within New York State, effective April 1. Sears will raise its annual rate to 21 percent from 18 percent, or to 1.75 percent monthly from 1.5 percent, and Montgomery Ward will increase its annual rate to 21.6 percent from 18 percent, or to 1.8 percent monthly from 1.5 percent.
1981-02-01	"Dining Out;
NEW SITE, NEW CHEF, BUT SAME OVENS"	"THE HIMALAYA, an Indian restaurant once in Tinton Falls, was reviewed on these pages three years ago. Since then, it has moved to the Highlands and acquired a liquor license and a new chef.

Fortunately, the proprietor, Deem Sondhi, kept the tandoor clay ovens when he moved, and these are on view behind a glass window at the rear of the casual, booth-lined dining room.

The ovens are sunk into a tiled counter, so that only the tops are exposed. The diners can watch as Luthfur Rahnan, the turbaned chef, threads chicken, meat or seafood, which first has been marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices and red food coloring, onto the long metal rods."
1981-02-01	Dining Out; FINE SEAFOOD IN UNREFINED SETTING	HARTFORD IT isn't every restaurant in Connecticut that can claim - as the Honiss Oyster House Company does - to have served Mark Twain, Babe Ruth, Andre Previn and Steve Martin, or to have the very booth where Buffalo Bill Cody ate regularly when he was in town with his Wild West Show. The Honiss's dimly-lit basement walls are crammed with photographs of customers past. There are more than a thousand pictures in all, dating to the 1880's, when Thomas Honiss and Fred Atchinson purchased the then-40-year-old restaurant downstairs in the United States Hotel. The hotel is long gone, but the restaurant is still in the basement of what is now the Hartford Federal Savings Bank Building, and continues to serve fresh seafood - and only seafood. An 11-month-long strike that ended late last year debilitated but did not close the old Hartford standby, and it now functions pretty much as before. While the unchanged and grimy decor may comfort old-timers who resist change, it can be depressing to newcomers. Nostalgia and history would still be served if the old Cody-era wooden booths were well lighted and less tippy, the dingy walls repainted, and the exposed pipes camouflaged, not just bandaged with tape.
1981-02-01	Dining Out; A GOOD PLACE TO SAMPLE SUSHI	TAIKO, a Japanese restaurant in Rockville Centre, has the friendliest sushi bar on the Island. For anyone who is unfamiliar with sushi or shashimi and is interested in sampling these Japanese raw fish delicacies, Taiko's sushi bar would be a good place to start. The owner, Alex Ishibashi, and the head sushi chef, Yuki Yoshida, are eager to explain about sushi and to assist patrons in making selections. Unlike some sushi bars where most of the chairs are regularly occupied by Japanese, the bright, newly expanded one at Taiko attracts many non-Orientals.
1981-01-30	From haute cuisine to brasserie style.	FEW restaurants have ever earned so instant a success as Le Chantilly when it opened on East 57th Street early in 1978. Well deserving of three stars right from the start, it continued to maintain that level despite the sort of overwhelming popularity that often defeats less experienced hands. If Le Chantilly is now slightly below its original level of excellence, it still maintains an average far above many haute cuisine French restaurants in the city. The original partners still hold forth here, with Paul Dessibourg in the dining room and Roland Chenus in the kitchen. A serious loss has been Dieter Schorner, the inspired pastry chef, who moved his rolling pins and flan rings over to Le Cirque a few months ago, thus virtually wiping out one of Le Chantilly's most spectacular courses. Now pastries are decent and occasionally excellent and both chocolate and Grand Marnier souffles are superb, but ''occasionally'' is a disappointment because during Mr. Schorner's tenure there was consistent brilliance.
1981-01-25	"Dining Out;
ADDED ATTRACTION NEXT TO THE MOVIES;
Added Attraction Next to the Movies"	"ALITTLE nook next to the cinema in a shopping center is an unlikely locale for pleasant Americanized French food, but the Joie de Vivre is just such a restaurant. It is situated in Chatham's Hickory Tree Mall and has been under new ownership since June.

Ever since John and Dee Shoaf took over the restaurant, their aim has been to steer it from its previous tea-room tone into a more substantial dining spot. Although the crepes and quiches are still there, a few of the new entrees sampled were satisfying dinner fare."
1981-01-25	"The Careful Shopper;
A Clutch of Designer Bags At Shoe Horn Shop"	"Coach bags, made of glove-tanned natural cowhide in limited quantities and each numbered, are prized by shoppers seeking sturdy, capacious and long-wearing handbags. One source for them is The Shoe Horn in Mamaroneck, where all merchandise is discounted on arrival, normally up to 20 percent off the manufacturer's suggested list price, with winter clearance through February cutting the cost by a minimum of another 20 percent. Men's shoes are discounted by 15 percent, now minus 20 percent again. Women's shoes are discounted up to 30 percent, and the seasonal markdown sometimes makes the discount more than 50 percent.

The Coach bag colors are traditional fashion shades - burgundy, black, putty, tobacco, navy, red, London tan, saddle and mocha - and sale prices range from more than $30 to more than $100."
1981-01-25	"Dining Out;
A SMALL PLACE FOR THE TRIED AND TRUE"	"SQUEEZED almost from view in a corner of the Station Shopping Mall in Tuckahoe, Mamma Assunta is a homey place popular with neighborhood diners who come for their tried-and-true favorites. The main dining room has only about a dozen tables; a few others in a screened-off private room take care of the overflow. In a restaurant this small, a single waiter can handle all the orders except at the most critical moments, and so Mamma Assunta's waiter, Giovanni Bucci, once of the Republic of San Marino, exerts by his extremely efficient presence a primary influence on the tone of the place. He makes it seem very Italian, in the style of establishments in towns off the main tourist routes, small palces that are nevertheless very proud of being ristorantes rather than mere tavernas.

But if Mamma Assunta is small, its menu is positively encyclopedic - more than 100 dishes without counting sandwiches, specials and what not. Although the skills of the chef, Elio DiRosa, once of the Abruzzi, have been developed over many years, and he is backed up by a sauce-making father and a managerial brother, no normal kitchen can make all those things well. There are a certain number of duds in the repertory, but there is no doubt that you can have a good dinner here."
1981-01-25	"The Careful Shopper;
Top Drawer Fashion- s In Westport"	"Top Drawer in easternmost Westport buys direct from top-notch designers of women's fashions in sizes 2 to 14, leaves the labels in, and immediately reduces the prices by 20 to 30 percent.

In February there are even greater savings - up to 50 percent off - on winter styles that must be cleared before spring. Choose carefully, however, because most merchandise cannot be returned or exchanged. Special orders are taken at full discounts."
1981-01-25	Dining Out; MORE PLACES FOR SUNDAY BRUNCHING	MAKEUP: THIS RUNS A BIT LONG - PLEASE DON'T CUT; WE'LL GET EXTRA SPACE. By PATRICIA BROOKS A GOOD cure for the ''Januaries'' is a bit of self-indulgence, and for the cook in the family that can happily take the form of Sunday brunch away from home. Some weeks ago we reviewed a potpourri of Fairfield County brunch stops. Today we offer a roundup of some lovely brunches a bit further afield. While Fairfield County brunches tend to follow a repetitive pattern of a limited menu of mostly egg dishes, some of the out-of-county restaurants featuring brunch tend toward heartier, buffet-style menus. If you follow the invitation to seconds, this could well be the only meal you will want the entire day.
1981-01-23	Nouvelle cuisine in a setting of surprises.	GREENE STREET in SoHo is a Chinese puzzle of surprises, offering a series of unexpected delights that slowly reveal themselves. The first surprise comes upon discovering that this restaurant has been in existence for a year in the middle of an otherwise dark and deserted block. Once inside, there is the pleasant shock of beauty - soaring arched brick walls, a profusion of potted trees, a big airy mural across one wall and a catwalk balcony where drinks are served. Wicker chairs on tiered platforms create an atmosphere reminiscent of an outdoor cafe in a town square, all centered around a stage on which jazz and classical musicians perform. The menu brings another surprise, for in such a setting, one hardly expects to find sophisticated attempts at nouvelle cuisine. But they abound here and many are turned out with considerable success. Further surprises come in the views of the restaurant from its varied angles. And if you walk around the balcony, there is the added diversion of an adjoining art gallery. In it at present is an exhibition of paintings and drawings by Clayton Campbell; food buffs should pay close attention to the pencil drawing, ''Hungry Ghosts,'' depicting famous eaters from Diamond Jim Brady to James Beard.
1981-01-18	"Dining Out;
A NEW TASTE OF THE OLD FRENCH"	"THERE are serious eaters around who believe that the best French restaurants of the past two decades have created a (some would even say the) golden age of cuisine. They point not only to the explicit triumphs of the new French cooking but also to the less-dramatic effects of the contemporary style upon quite traditional kitchens.  For every nouvelle cuisine establishment in the New York City area, there must be a half dozen others that have adopted several of the fashionable badges of the nouvelle style: lightly cooked skinny-cut vegetables, sauces thickened without flour, elegant arrangement with bright color contrasts, novel ingredients like kiwi fruit. Moreover, even though these restaurants may chose most of their dishes from those in the Larousse Gastronomique, they chose the ones less traveled by, and their menus do not bore.

Le Carre de Choux, a graceful, spankingly neat, white-walled little patch of a restaurant recently opened in Larchmont, is just such a place. Run by a clever Englishwoman named Alison Wilkinson, who has written a book on hors d'oeuvres, it offered, on our visits, French cooking that managed to be classic without being trite, listing dishes such as eggplant fritters that are perfectly Old French but are seldom offered by other establishments. The promising kitchen showed a certain unevenness, but the highs and lows averaged out to a satisfying two-star rating."
1981-01-18	Dining Out; SATISFYING STEAKHOUSE FARE	THE New Yorker Restaurant in Rockville Centre is Scotty Passarelli's third steakhouse on the Island. He originated Scotty's in Rockville Centre and owned the Corner House in Huntington after selling Scotty's in 1977. The New Yorker opened last May, and Mr. Passarelli, a very congenial host, said that returning to Rockville Centre was like coming home. As a moderately priced steakhouse, the New Yorker is better than average. The problem lies with the ambitious menu, which lists considerably more than typical steakhouse fare. If you limit selections to grilled meat, poultry and seafood, dinner at the New Yorker is likely to be highly satisfying. But once the chef is called upon to prepare a sauce or try his hand at seasoning Italian and Continental specialties, the quality slips.
1981-01-16	RESTAURANTS: A PROMISING CROP SPROUTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD	IF a proliferation of new restaurants can be considered one of a neighborhood's vital life signs, then Chelsea is taking nourishment in an encouraging way. Like truffles growing darkly and secretly under the fertile soil of Perigord forests, new and interesting eating places have been quietly sprouting along the graceful old streets and avenues of this revitalized section of the city. Anyone venturing around Chelsea to admire its gracious brownstones and gardens, to shop for antiques or to seek out its nighttime diversions, can find rest and personal restoration in a variety of settings. Typical of the Chelsea area are refurbished bars and grills of landmark caliber, with tiled floors, heavily embossed tin ceilings, fancy glass and dark wood paneling. Only a few of the interiors depart from this felicitous formula. At almost all, expect to find service that is polite and full of good-will but decidedly short on professionalism. Most of the dining-room staffs are young hopefuls in other fields, waiting on tables until their names are in lights or until their other goals are reached.
1981-01-12	THRIFT UNITS CAUTIOUS ON EXPANSION PLANS	Except for offering NOW accounts, the nation's 4,400 savings and loan associations are not rushing into the new world of banking that opened to them on Jan. 1. Thrift executives are wary of the pitfalls in nonmortgage consumer lending, even though they are now allowed to make such loans, and they are especially worried about the large losses possible in the credit-card business, which has also become available to them. Most show little, if any, enthusiasm about getting into the trust business. ''These new powers have been offered when the industry is in a state of crisis, when at least a third of the institutions are losing money,'' said Jonathan Gray, an analyst for the New York securities firm of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''They are not eager to jump into fields where even the old-timers are having a lot of trouble making profits.''
1981-01-11	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Women's Outerwear At Norwalk Outlet"	"JUST COATS LTD. is a true outlet for an American women's outerwear manufacturer. Low markups from the wholesale costs result in prices 20 to 50 percent below price tags elsewhere. A sale on Chinese down coats at $99, formerly $149, means holiday gift money goes even farther now. Although the manufacturer has been in business for 50 years, the retail business started just three years ago in Norwalk and later expanded to Danbury and Orange. Another shop will open in Springfield, Mass., in September.

A dress coat of 100 percent wool melton by Forstmann is a designer copy, double-breasted, in black only with velvet collar, ordinarily $250 with the designer label in. The copy is sold to stores for retailing at $179, but is $129 at Just Coats in regular sizes 6 through 16."
1981-01-11	"Dining Out;
TWO REASONS FOR AN INN'S POPULARITY"	"WHEN a restaurateur is very much there and caring, not only does it make the patrons feel pampered, but it also affects the attitude and performance of the staff. Steve Leanheart, the genial owner of Steve's Wortendyke Inn in Midland Park, near Wyckoff, is just such an attentive host.

Although the food sampled on our visits was not consistently first rate, especially in relation to the rather steep prices, the service and ambiance were. That surely accounts for most of the restaurant's popularity."
1981-01-11	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
After New Year's, Happy Markdown!"	"Just after New Year's, most prices were reduced by as much as 20 percent at Scarborough Fair, a Bronxville gift shop and tea room, with markdowns on holiday merchandise up to 40 percent. The reductions remain in effect throughout the month on some household and kitchen wares and on some jewelry and toys. The charges on consignment items and on home-cooked and home-baked foods, however, will not change.

At first glance cluttered, the shop has individual areas that, to the visitor, soon take on orderliness. Just before Christmas, visitors who had brought along a lively 16-month-old were welcomed and served, and they conquered their own initial apprehension at the presence of a toddler amid breakables. The Scarborough Fair staff remained calm, too, serving hot broccoli soup, quiche and an assortment of desserts with tea."
1981-01-09	by Mimi Sheraton; A Viennese nouvelle cuisine.	ALTHOUGH it seems quite natural that a negative review can damage a restaurant, it may be surprising to learn that a rave sometimes does a kind of damage all its own. Whether because of greed or inexperience, a restaurateur who gets a three-star or four-star rating, may pack the house beyond the capacities and temperaments of its kitchen and dining-room staff. The inevitable result of such action is poor food and rude or careless service, and a spate of justified complaints. It is gratifying, therefore, to discover that Vienna '79, which received a three-star rating last March, not only has been able to cope with success, but also has improved to the point where it well deserves a four-star rating. This despite the fact that the original chef left early in the fall to be replaced by the former sous-chef, Thomas Ferlesch, who is 24 years old. Full credit for this success belongs to Peter Grunauer, the proprietor, a dedicated cook and student of cuisine. Were he not, a change of chefs could turn this into a brand new restaurant. But Mr. Grunauer's consistent standards and knowledge of the cuisine has bridged the gap between staff changes, and his almost constant presence has kept cooks and waiters working smoothly and professionally.
1981-01-04	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
A Talbots Sale On Clothing"	"The Talbots traditionally marks down some of its first quality current women's clothing, and some men's wear by 50 percent on the first Monday of each January and July. This year the sale will run tomorrow from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., and will continue Tuesday from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.

Selected women's ready-to-wear and sportswear will be sale priced at all branches, including five in Connecticut, and in the main auditorium at the White Plains County Center in Westchester. Checks are acceptable, including those on out-of-state banks, but no credit cards. All sales are final."
1981-01-04	"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER;
Putting On A Pretty Face"	"Regal Beautician Products Inc. began in Larchmont as a wholesale supplier 35 years ago. Over the last 10 years, a retail shop has been added and now accounts for 20 percent of the business.

The bulk of the demand is for shampoos, conditioners, sprays, dyes and dryers for the hair, and skin-@ and nail-care products, most of them discounted at 20 percent, with larger discounts for greater quantities of some items.

The perfumes for men and women, mainly a convenience for retail customers. are reduced by at least 10 percent and include Charlie, Chaz, Jontue, Intimate, Colorado Sage, Denim, Tabac, Polo, Chaps, Gucci, Halston, John Weitz and Bill Blass. A Charlie set, usually $13, is $8.67. Charlie cologne, usually $9 for three and a half ounces, is $7.20."
1981-01-04	"DINING OUT;
INJECTING FAITH IN HOBOKEN'S FUTURE"	"APPROPRIATELY, the first review of 1981 features a relatively new restaurant that is proof of Hoboken's regeneration. Restaurateurs rarely invest in an area unless it has a pretty solid future.

Nine months ago, Michael Peters and his wife, Mary Beth, bought a typical corner bar called The Brass Rail and turned the large upstairs room into a brasserie-style restaurant.

Diners who are looking for the artificial atmosphere that some restaurants effect will be disappointed in The Brass Rail because the dining room has the honest simplicity of many European restaurants of this type. It has dark wainscotting, a high pressed-tin ceiling, white lace curtains and, on the tables, white cloths and napkins, plus small vases of fresh flowers."
1981-01-04	CONTINENTAL DINING IN GENIAL SETTING	HAMDEN ON looks alone, Shawn's might be awarded best-of-show. Much attention has been given to the two comfortable dining rooms and the spacious, separate bar in this house on Whitney Avenue. A copperycolored, pressed tin ceiling, rich dark wood paneling, graceful elongated mirrors lining one paneled wall, gaslights and etched glass wall sconces and a plethora of palms suggest a turn-of-century style that is natural and warmly inviting. If the decor is understated, so is the food - sometimes a bit too much so. Most dishes are competently prepared and served, portions are plentiful and the total dining experience is pleasing if not memorable.
1981-01-04	BISTRO FOOD, NICELY PREPARED	LE PETIT PARIS in West Babylon takes French cooking seriously. The menu does not offer fettuccine, clams casino or steak Diane to satisfy diners with Continental or northern Italian tastes who might wander in, the way some so-called French restaurants on the Island do. Although Le Petit Paris does not reflect any of the changes that French cooking has undergone in the last decade - with the stylish emphasis on undercooking, cream and butter rather than flour as thickeners and a trend toward somewhat exotic ingredients - it has pulled its straightforward, fairly classic little act together nicely. The emphasis is on bistro food, carefully prepared.
1981-01-02	by Mimi Sheraton; From Afghanistan and south of border.	''DO you realize we are eating in the only Afghan restaurant in New York?'' a man asked his friend at the two-month-old Pamir. ''I doubt that,'' the other man said. ''I can't believe there is only one of anything in this city.'' Such pride in New York is well-founded, because Pamir, on Second Avenue, between 74th and 75th Streets, is indeed the second Afghan restaurant in town, the first being the one-star Little Afghanistan, which opened a year ago on West 43d Street. Two restaurants may not indicate a trend, but there must be enough evidence of a sympathetic clientele to inspire a second investment in the presentation of the exotic, entertaining and satisfying cuisine of Afghanistan.
1980-12-29	Chemical Bank Credit Rate Up	The Chemical Bank announced that the annual percentage rate on its revolving credit accounts would be a uniform 18 percent starting in March, and that a $15 annual membership fee would be imposed on the bank's credit card accounts effective Feb. 1. A Chemical Bank spokesman said the 18 percent annual rate would cover the bank's MasterCard and Visa accounts, and its privilege checking and American Express gold card accounts. Previously, the rate for credit card purchases was 18 percent on the first $500 of credit, and 12 percent thereafter.

1980-12-28	SUSHI AND TEMPURA JOIN STEAK	SHIRO OF jAPAN in Carle Place has become two restaurants. The main dining room remains the Japanese steakhouse, with large grill tables at which a chef prepares a simple menu for up to eight assembled diners. Two months ago, an area to the rear was converted to a more traditional Japanese restaurant with sushi and tempura bars as well as table seating. It obviously reflects an increasing interest on the Island in authentic Japanese food, especially fish dishes. This split personality complicates an evaluation of the restaurant as much as it complicates dining. The steakhouse deserves barely a star, the sushi-tempura area close to two. But a single star overall is justified, especially since only fish is served in the sushitempura section, limiting the choice of dishes more severely than in many authentic-style Japanese restaurants.

1980-12-26	Restaurants; Sushi delights and East Side Italian. Takezushi Vivolo	SHORT of a starvation cure, the best antidote to the rich excess of holiday meals has to be a diet of sushi, those lean and delicate Japanese intricacies composed of gently vinegared rice, bits of raw fish and shellfish, icy, fresh cucumbers, pickled vegetables and nori, a black-green, dried seaweed that is as brightly restorative as a sea breeze. Canape-size sushi, dipped in winy, fermented soy sauce and fired with pickled ginger and wasabi, an incendiary green horseradish paste, provide rarefied gastronomic diversion. Like all sushi restaurants, the two Takezushi outposts - the original on 48th Street and its six-month-old offshoot on the corner of the Avenue of the Americas and 45th Street - prepare a full array of sashimi, the sparklingly dewy raw fish slices. The most dedicated aficionados of this informal and entertaining eating discipline, shun house assortments, varied and excellent though they may be, preferring to pick the particular types of sushi and sashimi that interest them.
1980-12-22	WEEKEND'S SALES LEVEL IS WEAK	The year's biggest shopping weekend turned out to be a disappointing cap to the year's Christmas buying season for metropolitan retailers, despite bumper-to-bumper traffic inching into shopping centers, long lines at cash registers and a flurry of advanced price reductions. Concern over inflation, employment, the economy and high interest rates this year has made consumers cautious and worried. Many said that they were scurrying from store to store for the best value even though they were buying less than a year ago. Visits to downtown stores and to three major suburban malls, as well as interviews with merchants and shoppers, indicated that the public has sharply reined in its holiday buying.

This is actually a twofold problem, for a restaurant has to decide on one of two things. Should it appeal to those few diners who already are cognizant of Japanese food and offer dishes that might seem strange to the uninitiated? Or should it try for mass appeal by serving food that is easily identifiable to the Western palate.

During the winter - and particularly in the holiday season - Sunday brunch seems especially festive. It is also a pleasant and easy way to entertain weekend visitors. Because many places offer special brunch prices, lower by far than their dinner prices, ''brunching'' can be a way to treat one's bank account with care while satisfying the desire to eat out. The following is a potpourri of Fairfield County places visited recently. Formal and fancy, informal and fanciful, sedate and serenaded - these restaurants are among a number that offer a wide range of choices for pleasant Sunday brunches. They are listed in alphabetical order by town.

Cross-country skiers at Ward Pound Ridge often combine outdoor exertion with indoor buying. Cash gifts can be turned into purchases here and there is no parking problem, though weekends are busiest.

1980-12-21	METAMORPHOSIS OF A THAI RESTAURANT	LE CAFE is an odd little place in New Rochelle that began life as a French restaurant (hence the name), hired a Hungarian cook (hence its goulash, chicken paprikash and veal Hungarian) and has in recent months, under the guidance of Narong Arjarasumpun, its Thai owner, introduced the only Thai cooking we know of in the county. It has a pleasant, nicely lighted dining room with silver-striped wallpaper and a dozen or so portraits of Thais in traditional costumes. When it first opened, it received favorable notice in this column for both its French and Hungarian food. The Hungarian chef has long departed, and neither cuisine is as well represented now, but the kitchen turns out some passable examples of Thai cooking that diners who happen to be in the area may find interesting. The soup of the evening, for example, is sometimes Thai fish soup, a thick, peasanty rice gruel flavored with whitefish. It disappoints those who expect a broth stocked with a wide variety of seafood, like zuppa di pesce. But as a Thai equivalent of fish chowder, it can, if ordered spicy, be quite satisfying.

1980-12-20	PITFALLS OF BUYING ON CREDIT	T IS the season to incur debt, and when the gift bills come due after New Year's many consumers will suffer a credit hangover of epic proportions, some experts fear. Last year, recalled Luther Gatling, director of the Community Service Society's credit counseling office, ''It was like someone pulled a curtain and shouted 'Stage front!' and everyone rushed forward with debt problems.'' For one thing, borrowers will begin to feel the bite of sharply higher interest rates permitted New York State banks under a deregulation measure that lifts longtime usury ceilings. Although credit card balances and other revolving credit lines like overdraft checking will continue to be charged at existing interest rates until at least late January, the tariff is expected then to rise substantially - Citibank has already announced a 19.8 percent rate plus a new $15 a year fee for Visa and MasterCard. Chase Manhattan will also impose the fee for its Visa card but will keep its rate down to 18 percent. Installment loan rates, meanwhile, have already risen from a previous range of 11 to 13 percent annually to 17 to 19 percent and climbing.

1980-12-19	Delicious, solid, countrified Swiss.	CHRISTMAS being a season of homecomings and renewed friendships, it seems completely appropriate now to have rediscovered the Chalet Suisse, a 27-year-old charmer that still glows with warmth and hospitality. The setting is operetta Swiss chalet, complete with dark wood beams, rough plaster walls, black wrought iron and waitresses in folkloric costumes, a combination that would be considered corny if newly created, but altogether felicitous as a longstanding tradition. Considering the sort of offhand treatment most restaurant staffs accord customers these days, it is almost nourishment enough to be in a place where the owner and all the waitresses really seem to care whether guests are satisfied or would like anything else, whether silverware has been polished before it is laid out on the table and where one never feels rushed even at peak lunch and pre-theater dinner hours. Dining after 7:30 P.M. is the most leisurely experience of all here and only occasionally does service become a bit slow - usually for large parties at busy times.

Like Citibank, Chase said it would introduce a $15 annual fee on its credit cards. Chase offers only the Visa card, but Citibank offers both Visa and MasterCard. Chase now charges the present legal limits of 18 percent on the first $500 owed for purchases, 12 percent for any amount over that, and 12 percent on cash advances against the card, but New York State's usury ceilings on consumer laws end Jan. 1.
1980-12-18	THURSDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1980; The Economy	President-elect Reagan is considering imposing an economic emergency when he takes office, according to James A. Baker 3d, the incoming chief of staff for the White House. He said that Mr. Reagan possibly would send the first budget cuts for 1981 to Congress on his Inauguration Day. (Page A1.) Oil prices could rise to $50 a barrel by spring, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ahmed Zaki Yamani, warned. While oil analysts called Sheik Yamani's remarks not relevant to the softening spot market for crude oil, they said prices could rise substantially by summer because of the drawdown in world oil stocks following the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war.

Notification of the changes has been mailed to the approximately 5.8 million individuals across the country who hold Citibank credit cards, about 1.2 million of them in New York State. The move, reported initially by banking sources, was confirmed yesterday by Dee M. Calligar, vice president and general counsel of the bank's credit card division.

1980-12-14	GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS HERE, TOO	SIPPING a drink in the snug bar on a blustery evening while a fire crackles in the old brick hearth, one can sense that The Old '76 House is a haven with a long and interesting history. The earliest records for this charming building of pink sandstone - it is in the Rockland County community of Tappan, N.Y., just across the state line -date from 1753, when it served as a tavern. It also is known as Andre's Prison because Maj. John Andre, the British spy who was in cahoots with Benedict Arnold, was imprisoned here before his execution in 1780. And, naturally, someone named George Washington was here, too. The oil lamps on white-clothed tables, old framed prints and knickknacks on the walls, as well as the homey waitress service, all add to the welcoming ambiance.
1980-12-14	COZILY CONVIVIAL IN GLASTONBURY	GLASTONBURY IN Glastonbury, The Parson's Daughter may well be the prettiest restaurant in town. Situated in a well-maintained old frame building on a corner, it has two small dining rooms on two floors. The ambiance in both is low key, cozy and convivial. On the ground floor, the dining room windows are framed by printed draperies, and lowbeamed ceilings add intimacy to eating at the few, comfortably-spaced tables. Rough-hewn posts, old photographs and prints, wall sconces (electrified), give a ho mey feeling to the place. During our visits a large window along one street-level wall contained pumpkins in a festive harvest displ ay. The tables are set with the same attention to detail. Pressed-glass water and wine glasses, handsome royal blue tablecloths and napkins, and stainless cutlery resembling old pewter add to the agreeable surroundings. By day that comfort translates into a bright and cheerful atmosphere - what in pre-E.R.A. days might have been called a ladies' luncheon place. At night with low lights and kerosene lamps flickering on each table, the mood is decidedly romantic, seemingly inviting intimate dinner for two. Surprisingly, given this ambiance, most of the tables are for four, not for two.

1980-12-12	by Mimi Sheraton; Midtown offshoot an d Chelsea outpost.	CONSIDERING the dearth of good, stylish restaurants close to the garment center, the theater district and Madison Square Garden, a more propititous location could not have been found for the second rendition of Woods. Opened just seven weeks ago on 37th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, this high and handsome modern restaurant has already become a lunchtime oasis and it is rapidly gaining a following for dinner as well. The menu offers the same sort of sparkling fresh, young-spirited and original dishes as the twoand-a-half-year-old Madison Avenue original, but the newcomer is far more comfortable and felicitous. Persistent and head-splitting noise has been the drawback at the uptown location, but that flaw has been avoided at the new outpost, where high ceilings and a series of hanging, arched, channel-quilted fabric panels work e fficiently as sound baffles. For the rest, the dining room i s trimly and boldly tailored, and strips of mirrors overthe tops of t he banquettes enliven the view for those seated facing in. Just a fe w tables for two are awkwardly placed, and there are still some sl owdowns in service at peak hours.

By either name, the Chinese capital is credited with the creation of Peking duck, a miraculous combination of golden, lacquer-bright skin, moistly tender meat, icy scallions and cucumbers - all mellowed with a velvety Hoisin sauce and folded into a hot, paper-thin crepe to be eaten out of the hand. Based on a fresh-killed duck that is pumped with air to loosen skin from meat, the preparation for this creation includes dousings of boiling water and hanging the duck for 24 hours to allow fat to drain off and the skin to achieve a parchment glaze. The skin is then rubbed with maltose (sometimes honey) and the bird is roasted in a hot oven.

It offers a moderate-length menu of 17 plain American main dishes, 9 appetizers and a varying number of desserts. The kitchen prepares good food, by and large, welcome to those in the neighborhood. The main attraction here is steak, offered in a half-dozen different cuts. All that we tried were acceptable. None was what we mean by prime steak - that is, finely webbed, or ''marbled,'' with delicate fatty tissues that baste the meat internally as it broils and are the chief source of succulent flavor in beef. But many of them may well be prime according to current grading rules, which have extended the meaning of prime to include less-marbled steaks formerly labeled choice. The change in laws has satisfied the meat producers, who argued that there was not enough prime beef. Now, magically, there is. If a few diners are not as satisfied as they might be, well, no one said that semantics was the best sauce.

THE Italian steakhouse is a New York creation, a stylistic triumph that has long been envied and which now is being copied from coast to coast. Appealing primarily to trenchermen of the old school, menus in these restaurants feature classic steakhouse fare such as shellfish cocktails, the sirloin steaks elsewhere identified as New York strips, chops, Brobdi ngnagian lobsters m ost classically broiled,fried onion rings, creamed spinach, t omato-and-raw-onion s alad, potatoes (baked, hash browns or cottage fries) and, for de ssert, the trademark New York cheesecake - lofty and vanilla scented, combining graininess with creaminess in magically subtle proportions . But lusty an array as that might be, it is only half the story, for such menus receive further enrichment by way of a limited but solid repertory of Italian dishes, all cooked-to-order specialties that fit into the high-tone short-order format of the basic steakhouse kitchen. Clams, which can be had raw on the half-shell, are also offered baked oreganata style, under a mantle of garlicky breadcrumbs or grilled with flecks of bacon, casino-style, or simmered with garlic and herbs in a tomato broth in the manner of Posilippo. Antipasto choices, such as peppers and anchovies or prosciutto and melon, seem appropriate before the simple grilled main courses, and to establish a firm underpinning for the unadorned fare, there are simple, traditional pastas - linguine with red or white clam sauce or simply with garlic and oil, fettuccine Alfredo or spaghetti in a marinara sauce.

Homemade soup co mes in a large crock with freshly baked whole-wheat, oatmeal or ca rrot bread and sweet butter.

1980-11-16	DINING OUT Trying to Live Up to Haute Tradition	THERE are several good restaurants in the area that show a strong Swiss influence and considering the minor place Swiss cuisine holds in the American consciousness, several is a surprisingly large number.
1980-11-16	Laminated Furniture At the Mica-Mart	Mica-Mar began 13 years ago in Yonkers as a manufacturer of laminated-plastic tables, beds, storage units, desks and dressers with a glossy catalogue for decorators and design stores. Now there is an outlet, the Mica-Mart, in the basement of the factory, and instead of the annual clearance sale, there are timed markdowns. The entrance is steep, down a long truck ramp to the basement, but the prices are not - generally 25 percent above wholesale for current styles, with other models marked down by 25 or 50 percent. One cocktail table has solid, slanted sides and looks like the base of a pyramid. It has a finish called Stonehenge, a burl-like plastic, Ted Hirsch, the owner, said. Once $292, it is $146.
1980-11-16	RIOTTO AND POLENTA JOIN THE MENU	WHEN a restaurant calls itself northern Italian, it usually means that the prices are higher, the setting may be more elegant and the food is Continental. But at Il Paradiso, recently opened in Greenvale, there is serious attention paid to the food of the northern provinces of Italy. The menu lists specialties such as risotto, the broth-enriched short grain rice dish, and polenta made from cornmeal. The air-dried beef of Lombardy, bresaola, is available as an appetizer, and potato dumplings called gnocchi are featured from time to time. Most of the pasta dishes are made with fresh egg noodles rather than spaghetti or macaroni. O n one occasion, the special of the day was fegato alla Veneziana, ca lves' liver Venetian style, sliced thin, with tender onions in a w hite wine sauce. It is unusual to find this dish as wellprepared as i t was at Il Paradiso.
1980-11-16	TRYING TO LIVE UP TO HAUTE TRADITION	THERE are several good restaurants in the area that show a strong Swiss influence -and considering the minor place Swiss cuisine holds in the American consciousness, several is a surprisingly large number. Among them, Plumbush in Cold Spring has been the most distinguished, one of a tiny band of three-star restaurants. But within the last year, there seems to have bee n a falling-off in both its food and service. Now, although Plumbush still produces some verygood food, it no longer stands clearly above all the other Swiss-influenced establishments. Ans Benderer, who looks after the kitchen, and Gieri Albin, in charge of the dining rooms and the splendid bar, went to Cold Spring three years ago from Connecticut's Stonehenge. They took over a sprawling old house, preserving the individuality of the sitting rooms and parlors, many with fireplaces, some oak-paneled and one with bold cabbage-rose wallpaper. What they created was one of the county's pleasantest places to dine.
1980-11-16	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER; Easy and Easiest For Holiday Baking Laminated Furniture At the Mica-Mart	MAKERS will find ways to save energy, time and money among the frozen products at the Oronoque Orchards retail store in Stratford. There, two fluted, rolled, oven-ready crusts in disposable pans, plus a third crust for topping, are $1.05, or $1.15 for deep-dish pies, a considerable saving from the $1.33 and $1.39 charged elsewhere. Roll-your-o wn pastry is 85 cents a pound and two-pound blocks are $1.70; a box of 50 nine-inch crusts sells for $18.40 ($19.40 for deep-dish she lls) and six-inch shells, 90 to a box, are $28.80. Most of the dozen varieties are also sold frozen and unbaked at $2.95 each. Three sets of ovens allow production of 300 pies an hour, with concentration on apple, apple crumb, pumpkin, mince and pecan varieties. This will add up to 20,000 pies sold between the 24th and the 27th at 1 P.M., when the doors close for Thanksgiving. Most nineinch fruit pies are $2.95; blueberry is $3.60 and pecan $3.95.

1980-11-14	Restaurants; French nouvelle and classic cuisine. The Odeon Aubergine	TWO very different French restaurants opened recently at opposite ends of town. One is classic French, the other nouvelle cuisine. They have in common a good kitchen, an efficient and professional staff and attractive surroundings. The warehouse district of Lower Manhattan is not the place one would expect to find French food, or indeed any first-class cooking, but the Odeon, a former cafeteria on West Broadway at Thomas Street, serves fine nouvelle cuisine. It is owned by a former waiter, Keith McNally, who is venturing into restaurant management for the first time. The warehouse-lined streets are no longer totally dark and empty at night. The gaunt buildings are rapidly being converted to lofts, restaurants and shops.
1980-11-14	by Moira Hodgson; French nouvelle and classic cuisine.	BREAKFAST counts. Especially for people who eat it at a restaurant, whether for business or pleasure. There is a great variety around New York, from croissants to grits, from the Upper East Side to Chinatown. And in some circles weekday breakfasts count a great deal. At the higher levels of business, financial and political life, starting the day with informal meetings at 8 A.M. in certain hotel dining rooms or restaurants has become routine. When asked where the influential people who lunch in the Grill Room at the Four Seasons eat breakfast, Michael Korda, editor in chief of Simon & Schuster and author of ''Power,'' said he assumed they ate at home, but Morton Janklow, the lawyer-agent, replied, ''The Regency.''
1980-11-12	EATING OUT IN STYLE	A new Martin Brothers Menswear store opened last week at the White Plains Mall. It is the fourth in the county, because two Buddy Mitchell Army-Navy stores, at the mall and in Yonkers, came under Martin's ownership in January. The new store, next to the existing one on the mall's second floor, offers as an opening special 20 to 40 percent off recommended retail prices. There are sportcoats, outerwear, rainwear, designer jeans, sweaters and shirts. Alterations are free.

For many people, the question of where to eat inevitably comes up. Fortunately, New Haven now has a number of satisfying answers. New Haven is one of the best cities in the state for ethnic foods - Basel's for Greek food and Leon's, 500 Blake Street or Delmonaco's for an Italian adventure are all good, reasonable choices. But within the last year or so three new non-ethnic restaurants have opened in town and deserve some attention.

1980-11-02	DINING OUT Three Recent New Haven Additions	LA SILHOUETTE is a recent addition to the growing list of fine restaurants in Roslyn. It replaces the attractive but short-lived Fontana's. The restaurant is an imaginatively recycled automobile dealership that has been given a soft warm look with a deep-rose color scheme that compliments the exposed brickwork and polished woodwork. An unbroken flow of pale drapes has replaced somewhat fussy lace curtains. It is one of the loveliest restaurants on the Island. The tables are well spaced and elegantly set, but the chairs have not been designed for total comfort. La Silhouette is a smoothly run establishment that draws on professional talents. If the owner and one of the captains look familiar, it is because they have been associated with other North Shore restaurants.
1980-11-02	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER; Factory Outlets All in a Row Quality Sportswear At Sizable Discounts	How to Receive Mail and Money While Away From Home One of the most important needs of a traveler is to maintain a link with home. Few people who are far from home want to be cut off to the extent that they cannot at least receive occasional letters. And when emergencies occur, travelers should know where and how to get money quickly.
1980-11-02	by Jeanne Clare Feron; Quality Sportswear At Sizable Discounts	Eleanor Solta has a simple premise for the woman with more taste than time to shop for wardrobe supplements: buy less and buy better - for fit, for quality and for the look that is preferred. Her discounted specialties at Solta's Sportique are first-quality sportswear and understated yet elegant dresses, and cruise wear is already in stock to satisfy those whose fall wardrobes are complete. There is a November sale for extra wardrobe components in sizes 4 to 16, with some shortwaisted styles. After 14 years of experience in merchandising, Miss Solta chooses to scout Manhattan sources two days a week to assemble ageless coordinates for her clientele, often seeking to match a special item for a particular customer. The word is passed from friend to friend about her establishment, where one can shop in comparative privacy with the help of the owner or her two assistants. There is a minimum discount of 20 percent, more for bigger items, and markdowns that move to half price in the sale corner.

It has merited such a rating for some time, as is clear from the roundup of Westchester brunches that appeared in this column last spring, where it appeared at the head of the list, trailed by several two-star restaurants. Nevertheless, we had a terrible dish of grilled oysters with marjoram and lavender as an appetizer there the other evening. Who, we considered darkly, had brought this lavender out of the closet, where it belongs, to accompany these lovely oysters?
1980-10-26	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER; Gracious Gifts Amid History Crystal and More At Georg Jensen The Contemporary In Furnishings	It may seem an unlikely setting for a gift shop - it was Horace Greeley's home while he campaigned for the Presidency in 1872 against Ulysses S. Grant - but the 11-room house in Chappaqua lends a special ambience to a search for gracious gifts. Silver by Gorham, Kirk, Towle and Reed & Barton is on sale at company-suggested markdowns of 50 percent. In fact, all silver but Tiffany is on sale until year's end. There are markdowns on china by Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Lenox, Minton, Wedgwood, Arabia and Denby until Nov. 15. The sales are announced first to mailing-list customers.

It is also indoor and outdoor sportswear for the family at discounts of 20 to 50 percent. Its recent move across Route 124 in the Scotts Corners area of Pound Ridge to the new Trinity Corners Shopping Center offers that mix of merchandise in expanded quarters. Limited amounts of summer wear and hooded raincoats are on sale at two-for-the-price-of-one, hard by a basketful of leather ski mitten samples on sale at $4.50. There are unusual buys in overruns and samples in sweaters, blouses and tennis clothes, with all designer labels removed. First-quality jeans, the kinds with unremovable labels, are in the $20 range, costing no more than $30, even when other retailers carry them at $40. Women's sizes are 6 to 16, with a few 18's.

The plants come from a company-owned nursery in Florida, reducing middleman costs and therefore prices on the 35 indoor varieties in stock. They include seven types of ficus Benjamina, a weeping fig, ordinarily $39 or $49 for a six-foot tree, but are only $18.95 here, with a smaller variety of ficus at $15.95 and a bush ficus for $9.95. Other popular items are bamboo palms and Kenthia palms at half-price, or $44.95, and Dracaena marginata plants at $19.95, or two for $37.

Inside, the Tyrolean charm is replaced by heavy-handed decoration that makes it seem like Hollywood's idea of a Continental restaurant. Thickly rusticated stucco walls are trimmed with beams and ornamental balustrades of dark wood. An assortment of banal, highly detailed oil paintings in carved frames fills the empty spaces. There is a tinkling fountain near the entrance and a freestanding stone fireplace dividing the dining room. Some tables are tucked into deep, semicircular tufted burgundy booths. Others are surrounded by capacious leather armchairs that swivel in executive comfort.

1980-10-19	WITH A FLORISH AND LITTLE ELSE OUT	MORTIMER'S, a popular Upper East Side establishment at Lexington Avenue and 75th Street, draws the crowd that summers in East Hampton or Newport. The atmosphere is clubby and slightly formal. Under close scrutiny from patrons at the bar, self-assured young men, in designer suits or gold-buttoned blazers, and decorative women eat fashionably, well and relatively inexpensively. At night the restaurant lights are dim, but not so dim as to banish its customers to total obscurity. The decor is minimal and consists of brick walls, black beams, mirrors and potted palms. To accommodate its swelling clientele, Mortimer's has recently opened an adjacent 'standby' dining room, where, although the action of seeing and being seen is less lively, it is pleasant and considerably quieter than the main room, which has a small bar and a gold-framed oil painting of a parrot on one wall.
1980-10-17	Restaurants; Mortimer's Bagatelle	FOR many years, Arturo's in Bellerose, just a couple of blocks from the Nassau County line, has been one of the Island's more reliable fine Italian restaurants. It offers hearty home-style cooking plus some of the more delicately rich specialties usually identified as ''northern Italian.'' Above all, it is a professional operation with a well-trained hierarchy of dining room personnel, carefully appointed tables and a good wine list. A few recent visits, however, showed that while Arturo's has not altered the basics, there are changes, none for the better. The preparation of certain dishes was surprisingly lackluster, and the service fluctuated between attentive and perfunctory. Therefore, this assessment is less favorable than others have been in the past.

The change of seasons means a change of clothing, of which there is a large variety within the several-block area known as Hartz Mountain. Some of the better finds in men's and women's wear are listed herein.
1980-10-12	ONE SOLUTION FOR CHEESE LOVERS	FOR nearly a year now, The Cheese Eaterie in Ardsley has been a fairly dependable source for cheese and fancy foods. For five months, it has been offering a lunch of cheeses, soups, sandwiches, quiches and salads in a pleasant contemporary back room. Now it has dressed the room attractively in beige and brown and has begun to provide full-scale, expensive dinners of interesting food, with a good pinch of nouvelle cuisine in most of its dishes. The idea of a cheese-shop-cum-dining room has an instant appeal: it offers a perfectly natural solution to the polymorphous desires of cheese lovers, a not inconsiderable portion of the population; and besides, the renown of cheesemonger Androuet's Parisian restaurant established on that pattern has spread throughout the world. The idea is particularly appealing here in Westchester, where cheese seems to have fallen into a peculiarly low estate in the culinary hierarchy. We have always approved of Clifton Fadiman's remark that there is no such thing as a bad cheese, but local restaurants have certainly demonstrated to our full dissatisfaction that there is often such a thing as a mediocre one.

Still others apparently find buyers quickly at $650 or more.

The lounge, with its dramatic cathedral ceiling and mirrored walls, features a cafe menu of quiches, crepes and sandwiches priced from $2.50 to $4.25.

What we found, both at Benji's in Darien and at The Spinning Wheel in Redding, was a sense of deja review.

A debit card differs from a charge card in that when an individual uses a debit card the charges are deducted directly from the holder's checking account. In contrast, purchases or cash advances made on a credit card are in the form of credit by the bank to the card holder.

The goal of the program is to achieve more competitive economics and better sales productivity through lower payroll and operating costs, said Edward S. Donnell, chairman and chief executive officer of the Chicago-based chain. A major part of the strategy is the conversion of 110 stores, or about one-quarter of the total, into discount units.

1980-09-14	WHERE PASTA IS FUN,ALSO DELICIOUS	DERBY PROOF that dining out needn't be an ordeal or even an occasion but can be fun is offered in abundance at DeLuca's Pasta, a two-year-old restaurant here. DeLuca's is plain, old-fashioned fun, and a meal there is not only an entertainment - if the pasta plant is in operation - but delicious dining as well. This light, airy restaurant is not a sublime culinary experience. DeLuca's knows its limits, and within those limits its performance is masterly. The limits are homemade pasta, prepared a number of ways, all tasty and nourishing. The only real problem with dining here is that it could be a weight-watcher's nightmare. There are no meat, poultry or fish dishes per se on the menu. In addition to the pasta dishes, there is a reasonably satisfying pizza, with any of nine supplementary toppings, and calzones, or peasant bread.
1980-09-14	Convivial Cluster In New Rochelle	A cluster of discount stores has been developed near Remin's on North Avenue in New Rochelle, and they are proving popular despite a parking problem. But that is being solved; extra spaces are available after 3 P.M. in a nearby school playground and, on Saturdays, in lots at Iona College. The French Connection Discount Boutique Inc. is part of a chain that began with imports but has become mostly American, with a mix of designers' and its own labels. Silk dresses seen elsewhere at $108 are $59 and $69. Designer jeans at half the retail price have fabric irregularities clearly indicated. Long-sleeve silk blouses are $34.99 instead of the usually advertised $75. Designer skirts are similarly marked down. The pattern is 50 percent off, with seasonal sales beyond that. There is no credit, no refunds and no exchanges.

Its setting, through a white picket fence and along a brick walk to the front door, has a picture book quality. Of the three small dining rooms, the largest, to the right of the door, is the most endearingly quaint. The room has a low-beam ceiling, wide floorboards, wainscoting, walls adorned with baskets and prints and tables surrounded by Windsor chairs. Beyond this room is a tiny garden party nook of a dining area boasting three tables and done in lace with white filigree metal chairs. To the left of the door the most formal room has plush high-backed blue chairs and skirted tables. The bar, with an unused staircase serving as the wine cellar, is in this room.

1980-09-07	by Jeanne Clare Feron; A 32-Page Catalogue Of Energy Savers	Those seeking changes in their living patterns in response to the energy crisis - whether because they are concerned about conservation in principle or for economic self-preservation -have a variety of sources to go to for information, and then a certain number of checkpoints to complete at home. The options are sometimes confusing, but gradually choices can be made that seem to promise progress. Robert DeLigter of New Rochelle has put together Energy Savers, a 32-page mail-order catalogue detailing what he regards as ''items that will actually pay for themselves in one to six months'' and which he says have been recommended in books and articles. The products, he adds, are in one catalogue; the consumers are given more facts and figures than they can get from the usual sales clerk; and the company can ship the orders out the same day they are received. A check with Donald R. Price, director, Office of Energy Programs at Cornell University, confirmed that the catalogue ''serves a good and important need.'' He added that although items vary in terms of savings, ''in general it is a reasonable listing'' and ''none seem to be gimmicky or a true waste of money.''
1980-08-31	MORE TO THE FOOD THAN MEETS THE EYE	IN Tarrytown there is a small restaurant called Lebanon that serves some terrific Middle Eastern dishes, but it seems to be patronized chiefly by people who come to see the dancing girls. A few blocks away are several well-known establishments that are regularly visited by freezer trucks; they have plenty of customers who do not seem to notice the difference between fresh and frozen food. The contrast in the public reception of these restaurants is dispiriting. We were put on to Lebanon by a couple of adventurous teen-agers. The atmosphere is very Levantine: Three narrow rooms like a blue and gold grotto, with picture carpets on the walls showing pliant dancers performing for recumbent sultans, khedives or emirs. We dined early to avoid the entertainment on one visit and our party was the only one there.

We had to conclude that Pepino's was a fine place to eat if one was a ''regular.'' The building is pleasantly Mediterranean in feeling, with brick and white stucco walls, wrought-iron ''fences'' separating dining areas, bits of greenery and a little fountain. The menu is a medley, with some southern and some northern Italian dishes. There are 21 entrees: seven veal, three chicken and 11 seafood dishes. There are also seven pasta combinations, including ravioli, cannelloni, lasagna and fettucine Alfredo.

1980-08-25	AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTERS AFFILIATE	A SENSE of spacious and gracious dining prevails at Hienkel's, a welcome new arrival on the generally sparse restaurant scene here. A large and pleasing bar is to the left of the entrance hall. The highceilinged dining room on the right has one fieldstone wall, with the others of finely finished limed southern pine. Hanging plants cascade from a skylight in the center. Gaslights flicker from wall sconces. White bentwood chairs, tables covered with white cloth and pink napkins provide a cool summer look to the dining area. One wonders, though, how such apparent expense can be economically justified by a dining room that serves only 38 people at a time. Yet the management seems to know exactly what it is doing. Service is unusually accommodating and on the whole well-trained. And the menus show some originality with a blend of current popular choices and a few surprises. There is an international flavor to the choices - six or more Italian entrees, the same number of French ones, and a few in adapted international style. Chicken cashew, for instance, is a somewhat Americanized version of a dish that uses a number of Chinese ingredients and cooking style. The same could be said of Chinese Hawaiian duck.

Even at those places that specialize in Sichuan and Hunan cooking, egg rolls, spare ribs, chow mein, egg drop soup and pepper steak are listed on the menu by popular demand. But the Cantonese menu at Diamond's goes beyond these items to include a number of dim sum-style appetizers, chicken or seafood bathed in black beans and ginger or richly seasoned with dark hoisin sauce. The restaurant consists of a pair of geodesic domes, the smaller one serving as the bar and joined to the larger one by a narrow corridor. The triangular modules used to construct the domes create faceted, diamond-patterned surfaces on the walls and ceilings, hence the name of the restaurant. The high-ceilinged dining room is furnished with comfortable upholstered banquettes and tables set at right angles to each other. The restaurant is orange and white inside and out, agreeably ultramodern and quite improbable for a Chinese restaurant.

It is astonishing that a new chef could step right in and prepare the range of dishes listed on it, including two pates, baby salmon, red snapper en papillote, whole chicken en casserole, elaborately sauced veal scaloppine, three kinds of duck, sweet souffles and enough desserts to fill a threetiered cart. But whoever is in charge of the kitchen is incapable of meeting the challenge. Dining at Villa Pierre has become a series of pretentious, overcooked and clumsily sauced disappointments.

The decor improves considerably inside the dining room, which forms an elongated U-shape loop around a tiny atrium, this negative first impression instantly changes. Rounded arches, hanging plants, courtyard trees and widely spaced tables contribute to an airy Mediterranean ambience. A small display of expensive hothouse anthuriums on each table and a large uniformed staff suggest managerial caring that bodes well for the evening meal ahead. Unfortunately, a uniform does not make the man, and an expensive floral arrangement does not make a dinner. Service, despite all the trappings, was indifferent, indolent, and exasperating, and not just on one occasion.

Called Seascape, it emphasizes marine fare. It occupies the premises of a former restaurant, Port Salud, on the second floor of a small house, with a rustic-looking cocktail bar on the first floor. If you approach from the parking lot in the rear, you can enter the restaurant directly. While the interior is somewhat dark, there is a cheerful, inviting open-air dining terrace on the hillside just beyond, out of sight of traffic along Riverside Avenue.
1980-08-10	DINING OUT PASTA AND FISHIN A STUINNING SETTING	CAPRICCIO in Brewster is stunningly set on a spit of land overlooking the Great West Branch Reservoir, among the rippling hills of Westchester and Putnam Counties' lake district. It is an ideal setting for an early evening dinner. Two of the dining rooms have been arranged on different levels so that those seated in the interior of the restaurant can see as well as those next to the window walls the long views of lake water and sky framed by mature oaks, maples and pines. The food is not as brilliant as the countryside, but much of it is good nevertheless. Capriccio is an Italian restaurant with a few Continental turns, and it prepares some of its dishes, particularly those of northern Italian origin, with a competence that makes it possible to have a very good dinner here.

Since it has become Hisae's, there is an atmosphere of renewed vigor and enthusiasm about Gil Clark's that makes dining very enjoyable. The interior has been simply painted white and tables are covered in assorted blue and white printed fabrics, suggesting but not overdoing the nautical theme.

Unlike the Island and New York State in general, Fargo and South Dakota have no usury laws limiting bank interest rates or preventing fees for use of credit cards. For some of New York's biggest bankers, that would be like nirvana, judging by the howls they raised recently when the State Legislature failed to act on a plan to ease banking restrictions. So irate are those bankers that at least three of New York's biggest banks, with many branches in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, are investigating the possibilities of moving all or some of their credit card operations to Fargo or to states with statutes that are more advantageous to banks.

1980-07-27	DINING OUT SERVICE FLOUNDERS AT SEAFOOD SPOT	WESTPORT IF you hanker to participate in a slapstick comedy while enjoying a seafood dinner, your wish could come true at Westport's newest restaurant, the Elm House. Everything that could have gone wrong there did for us recently. We ordered Scotch broth and were served Scotch salmon. We were among the first diners, yet were told after the appetizers had been served that the fried oysters we had ordered were all gone. This was after the waitress had announced that the seafood was delivered fresh every day. ''How come the oysters are gone already?'' we asked. ''Well, not everything comes in every day,'' was the reply. Our waitress stretched across the table to pour each glass of wine, sloshing it casually on the table as she reached from glass to glass. Orders of Brim and coffee were confused, as were refills. Another day, at a lunch for two, appetizers were served at different times. Entrees, too, were served five minutes apart.

In short, all the reconstructed village dining cliches. The restaurant in question, happily, is not like that at all but is far more innovative than the name suggests. (The name seems to be both a spinoff of the parent company, Frederick's, a caterer next door, and a suggestion of a colonial village.) Fredericksburg's decor is modified colonial, but the menu is not. You enter a simulated garden or ''village green,'' with real ficus trees dotted here and there throughout a large circular area under a skylight. At one side of the circle is a gazebo in which a harpist is ensconced each evening, providing gentle background music for diners.

Waterfront settings are still the most appealing in this popular resort area on the South Fork of Long Island, but a number of old inns, tastefully restored and furnished, provide engaging alternatives.

LE PLAISIR, which serves French nouvelle cuisine with a Japanese influence, is only a year and a half old, but it has already established itself as one of New York's most exciting restaurants. The chef, Masataka Kaboyashi, formerly with the Palace, is a culinary artist, who turns out edible paintings and is given to flights of fancy worthy of the French Surrealists. Le Plaisir is no place for solemn dining. Food is not served there; it is presented. Butter comes molded like those bars of soap in the shape of baby chickens that you played with in the bath as a child. The pearly bubble on top of your trout turns out to be marrow; a minuscule Art Nouveau leaf of bibb lettuce is blanched and spread bright green across a salmon quenelle; jellied consomme, topped with miniature poached quail eggs, conceals a generous portion of foie gras with a whole truffle nestled inside. The dishes generally live up to their looks. Stephen Spector and Peter Josten, the proprietors, operate a farm on Long Island from which they supply the restaurant with game. Veal, lamb and beef are of excellent quality, fish is fresh and properly cooked, and the vegetables are treated with equal care.
1980-07-13	SICILIAN STYLE WITH LUSTY SEASONING	THE generally accepted notion that a new restaurant requires a period of ''breaking in'' was dramatically confirmed after several visits to J.P.

The restaurant had an ambitious Sichuan-Hunan menu from the beginning, but the cooking has improved amazingly over the course of several weeks. Only by virtue of the fact that we experienced the same slow, spotty and occasionally forgetful service could we be sure we were in the same restaurant. Now that the kitchen has been whipped into shape, it's time to work on the dining room.

The five-acre lot is a place to dawdle in, seeing bits of masonry from old buildings, architectural remnants from stately homes, and stained glass windows from churches and synagogues. Home barbers can find suitable antique chairs for $150 (adult size) or $200 (child size). There are weathered Liberty ship hatch covers outside, and polished cocktail or dining tables of refinished versions inside. A capacious orange leatherette chair with back, arms and base of curved animal tusks, the last of a dozen of that sort, sells for $600. Three Finnish-made synagogue chandeliers, eight and a half feet in diameter, cost $1,500 each.

The village in question, Chester, is rather low-key itself, sandwiched between Routes 9 and 9A near Essex and East Haddam. Low-key doesn't mean low-grade. On the contrary, behind the blue frame facade on the village's only commercial street lies a relatively sophisticated establishment. The small dining room, which seats no more than 40, is painted white and the cloths and napkins are also white, with just a few reproductions on the walls, an oriental rug on the floor and tiny vases of fresh garden flowers on the tables for color. The room is especially inviting in summer, when the screened sets of French doors open to let river breezes pass through.

1980-07-06	Smoking Out A Real Fish Story	When Mayor Koch of New York took a supply of salmon cured in salted water, known on his block as lox, to Seattle for a mayors' conference, it was a fine example of ''carrying coals to Newcastle,'' for much of the breakfast delicacy available in his Big Apple originates in the waters of Washington. The Northwest is the source, too, of salmon for Homarus Inc., the Mount Kisco smokehouse that lures even New York City people up to the Golden Apple of Westchester on Saturdays for retail sales at wholesale prices of a quite different product, salmon pressed between marble slabs and dry-cured by smoking the way it is done in Scotland. It achieves a less-salty taste and a stunning price, $8.50 a pound, with the slicing to be done at home.

1980-07-04	RETAILERS AND BANKS HAIL LIFTING OF CREDIT CONTROLS	The nation's major retailers and largest banks said yesterday that they welcomed the phasing out of the Federal Reserve Board's credit controls because they hoped the move would stimulate Americans to step up buying on credit. Citibank, New York's largest bank and the second largest in the nation after the Bank of America, said it would ''phase out'' the restrictions it had imposed in the wake of the March 14 implementation of credit controls.

The New York division of Gimbel Brothers began accepting the American Express card last week at the Broadway and 33d Street store and the East Side store at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue. Gimbels, one of the New York area's largest retailers, will also ''hook into a bank computer authorization system'' to test wider use of the American Express card, a store spokesman said yesterday.

Try-ons of specific shirts are not allowed - just size samples - but other things can be examined for fit. There are irregulars and seconds as well as quality shirts, with more full-cut shirts than tapered styles. There are discounts of 40 to 60 percent on a variety of clothing: men's jeans by name designers, all-wool tropical and wool-andpolyester-blend suits; Viyella men's shirts; cotton lisle knit shirts; name-brand jogging jackets and an array of sweaters for men and women from the best-known manufacturers in cashmere, merino, shetland and lamb's wool, imported from Scotland and England. There are also socks, ties and belts. Other women's clothing includes dresses, blazers, skirts, blouses, jeans and slacks.

1980-06-29	DINING OUT FRENCH REVIVAL OF A FORMER GLORY	SOME restaurants are getting better. The Bird and Bottle Inn went into a long decline, a kind of after-dinner doze, after its initial success in the 1940's. Then Tom Noonan took over in 1973, and it has been slowly improving ever since. Two years ago it was already a commendable restaurant, and now, with lively touches of the new French cooking quickening its style and a greater than usual discipline in preparing its traditional dishes, The Bird and Bottle provides a very good dinner in the splendid setting of what was evidently once an 18th-century up-county tavern. Set on broad lawns among grandiose sugar maples, it is an archetypal Colonial house with dining rooms of the sort that envious decorators never manage to imitate well. The magnificent beams barely clear the heads of the tall young generations, who duck gracefully on the way to their tables. And with its quavering candles, soft yellow lights from the sconces, the place looks like something out of ''Barry Lyndon.''

Two dining rooms with low ceilings, stuccoed walls and dark, roughhewn beams and supports have a cozy, provincial look that is enhanced by printed curtains and framed paintings of genre scenes. There is nothing provincial about the elaborate, elegant table settings, however, or about the food.
1980-06-29	DINING OUT A TASTE OF INDIA IN NORWALK	NORWALK INDIAN restaurants seem to be a rare commodity in Connecticut (we know of only three), and in the spirit of ethnic food diversity we like to see them thrive. That is why we have given Anand of India longer than usual to work out the problems that all new restaurants face. When Anand opened seven months ago in the large building on Route 1 vacated by the Red Onion, we were less than impressed with the quality, quantity and prices of its many offerings. Prices seemed high for slim portions, and the quality of individual dishes fluctuated from fairly good to reheated disappointments. Happily, that is not the end of the story. The restaurant has persevered, and several recent visits disclosed improvements. Portions are still modest, but the prices remain the same, and in these inflationary times this means that the cost per item no longer seems outrageous.

1980-06-29	THE CAREFUL SHOPPER; Shirts and Sweaters At Decker's Spilling the Beans On Coffee Blends In Norwalk A Clothing Sale In a Family Setting	MAKOTA NODA has come from Kyoto to Central Avenue in Yonkers to work at his trade of teppan cook. A teppan is one of those table-size griddles one eats at in Japanese steakhouses. It lends itself to a certain amount of theater along with the cooking, and teppan cooks become almost the only culinary personalities known to people who are not in the restaurant trades. Mr. Noda, who usually performs these days at Edo Plaza, has developed a certain following for the elegance and brilliance of his slicing (more restrained than the teppan showoffs, he resembles a lightning painter creating the shrimp before him rather than someone discarding heads, tails and veins). Now he has decided to use his reputation on his own: he has opened Noda's, a restaurant under the management of his wife, at which he works one or two days a week.

Entree prices at Chez Serge are $14 to $19.50 and appetizers range from $2 for a salad to $4.75. After one recovers from the near-cardiac arrest that occurs when reading the blackboard on the wall (there is no printed menu), one can settle back for a good, if not exceptional, meal. It should be stated up front that portions are large; in fact, more realistic portions might help bring the prices into line.

The Helen Whiting Factory Outlet for Famous Brands in Pleasantville still offers prices 20 to 50 percent below retail on designer wear as well as its Ultrasport tennis and golf clothing, although the outlet's store in Pelham Manor, perhaps more familiar to those in the southern part of the county, closed in January. Shoppers make their selections to the hum of nearby sewing machines, and commercial-size rolls of fabric are visible, lending an awareness of the manufacturing process.

It also has the best steaks, fried onions and cottage fries not only in East Hampton but, with the possible exception of the Palm in Manhattan, in the entire tristate area. Newly installed this season in East Hampton's historic Huntting Inn, the Palm effectively maintains its reputation for superb, deeply satisfying hunks of red meat and amazing crustaceans. There is more to the Palm than steaks and lobsters, however. This is particularly evident in the East Hampton Palm, where, unlike the Palm in Manhattan, printed menus have been provided. Since the list of choices is obtained without persistently interrogating the waiter, one might be tempted to sample some other items like chicken, fish or veal. Very little of the menu's sizable inventory is in the same class as the steaks and lobster.
1980-06-22	Superb Steaks and Lobsters, but...	GUILFORD IN the summertime a diner's fancy often turns to thoughts of the shore. Long a favorite of those who succumb to such siren songs is the Little Stone House, which faces the wharf and harbor here. The setting is a pretty one, and the sea breezes are usually cool and inviting. Would that the food were better! It is possible that the Little Stone House is a victim of its own popularity. Several large rooms are often packed with diners, who seem willing to put up with slow service and generally pedestrian food served on plastic mats (which get rather gummy on occasion) at steep prices. One supposes that the sense of eating fresh seafood on the shore overwhelms or suspends critical judgment.

The pair of tailored brown, beige and white dining rooms on the main floor of an unprepossessing white house just off Route 110 are furnished with attractively set tables and contemporary cane chairs. Flowers and a few framed prints soften the look. Another small room with a bar is up a narrow flight of stairs. Although the cuisine and its presentation are rather formal, and the restaurant has a smart look, the crowd tends to be somewhat casual. Jackets are not the unanimous style for men.

Rather dimly lighted, it is laid out in two small plain dining rooms with a separate barroom as though designed to have the intimacy of a pub - which in fact the premises once housed. It is a neighborhood place whose management greets many of the diners by name, and the regulars, familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the kitchen, seem to order pretty much what they want and how they want it. We found some items on the regular menu (made up almost exclusively of Italian, and generally of southern Italian, dishes) that needed no alterations. They had the happy versatility of being able to function both as appetizers and, in larger portions, as entrees: the mussels (zuppa di mussels, the menu says), fat, fresh and luscious, heaped in a bowlful of sea-scented broth accented with basil; and the calamari, tender rings of squid bathed in a well-proportioned light marinara sauce.

1980-06-15	BY JEANNE CLARE BENTON; Armchair Shoppers: An Occasion to Rise	Some people who like to choose their own hours for making selections often use mail-order catalogues. Others prefer to visit a company's store to reassure themselves about the merchandise. The first anniversary sale Saturday and Sunday of a $200,000 inventory at the Lillian Vernon Distribution Center may lure those armchair shoppers to Port Chester and divert those more familiar with the Mount Vernon retail store to the scene of a saving of one-third to two-thirds off catalogue prices on overstocks, discontinued merchandise, and manufacturers' errors, according to a company representative. The company has notified many of its customers to get there on Friday between 4:30 and 8 P.M. for a private preview sale. Lillian Vernon's store in Mount Vernon will be closed next Saturday during the clearance of gifts, cookware, housewares, desk needs, Christmas decorations and men's accessories. A 20-piece service for four of Ironstone dinnerware, originally $39.98 in the catalog, will be $18; black-handled cutlery by Supreme, a five-piece stainlesssteel flatware set once $24.98, will be $10. A lucite-and-stainless flatware five-piece setting, formerly $10.98, will be $5; assorted imported soaps are 25 cents a piece; imported stationery with 20 sheets and envelopes, $3; and Bert and Harry or Sesame Street hand towels will be $1.98.

1980-06-08	DINING OUT CUISINE FROM EAST AND WEST	BRANFORD VIETNAMESE cooking has been a long time making its way to Connecticut, but it has arrived at Chez Bach, which faces the village green here. Chez Bach combines two worlds in its title and on its premises, with samplings of both Vietnamese and French cuisine. It isn't as unlikely a combination as it may seem at first, considering the long time the French spent in Indochina. Actually, there are other echoes here as well, for Chez Bach occupies the premises - and seems not to have much changed the decor - of a former Italian restaurant. The gold-flecked wallpaper and black plastic booths and chairs have a familiar look.
1980-06-05	BUSINESS Digest; Washington The Economy Markets International Companies Today's Columns	The President's oil-import fee was overwhelmingly rejected by Congress in a stunning rebuke to both Mr. Carter and the Congressional Democratic leadership. The House vote was 376 to 30 and the Senate's 73 to 16, despite a last-minute phone campaign by President Carter. The lopsided vote made a Congressional override of the President's promised veto almost certain. The fee was to have been passed along as a 10-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline prices. (Page A1.) The Carter Administration may have to ask Congress to delay another increase in dairy price supports that are slated for October, if milk production continues at its current record pace, Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland said. He acknowledged it would be a politically dangerous move in an election year, but added that even the dairy industry was worried about the program's $1 billion cost. (D1.)

The decision affirmed a June 1978 ruling by a state Supreme Court in a class-action suit brought by three Nassau County residents. The case had been affirmed by the Appellate Division last August. Yesterday's action constituted a final decision in the case and will mean reimbursements of up to $10 a customer, plus 6 percent annual accrued interest.

One of New Haven's better choices is Delmonaco's, which manages to please both the eye and the palate. This is certainly one of the prettiest restaurants we have visited lately.

Presale sales are held here regularly, too, with notification by mail. Church's handmade women's shoes are sold in the front shop alone, and not at any other branch in America. There are five styles at the moment, priced from $29.95 to $79.95, with 20 others to come later this year. There are 100 styles for men in sizes 6 through 13, AA to EEE.
