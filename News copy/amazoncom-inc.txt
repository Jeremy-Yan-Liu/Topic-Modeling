2012-05-30	Books Under Glass: The Many Faces Of E-Readers	IN some ways, the only reason to stick with dead tree books these days is nostalgia. E-readers are more fully featured and much more impressive than ever, and they have fallen far below the $100 price tag because of improved technologies. If you are still content to read the latest Stephen King novel in its full five-pounds-of-paper glory, get ready to rethink your habits. First, a little about e-reader technologies. If you are looking for long battery life and great legibility, there are E Ink devices. E Ink screens contain millions of tiny, inklike ''spots'' that turn on and off just like the screen of an LCD, or liquid-crystal display. E Ink devices also show many shades of gray. And they have excellent battery life -- lasting sometimes as long as two months on standby. One problem? Except for one model, the Nook Simple Touch, they cannot be read in the dark.

2012-05-19	Do You Want the Good News First?	Seattle I'VE spent the last week traveling to two of America's greatest innovation hubs -- Silicon Valley and Seattle -- and the trip left me feeling a combination of exhilaration and dread. The excitement comes from not only seeing the stunning amount of innovation emerging from the ground up, but from seeing the new tools coming on stream that are, as Amazon.com's founder, Jeff Bezos, put it to me, ''eliminating all the gatekeepers'' -- making it easier and cheaper than ever to publish your own book, start your own company and chase your own dream. Never have individuals been more empowered, and we're still just at the start of this trend.

The retailer's refusal to collect sales tax in many states is a persistent grievance. Independent booksellers have even been forced into the novel position of hoping that their onetime foe, Barnes & Noble, survives so that it can serve as a bulwark against Amazon. Publishers, if anything, are more fearful than booksellers. From Amazon's point of view, it does not want to destroy the book business but simply to reinvent it. (Amazon declined to comment.)

But at the top and interspersed all the way through are novels written by living if somewhat obscure authors. Romances, mostly, often with a Christian theme."

2012-01-09	Amazon Expected To Start Offering Data Analytics	Amazon.com, through its Web services business, stores vast amounts of data for companies worldwide. Does it want to start analyzing it too? Specialists in data science say the company has become increasingly interested in the business models of firms that make and sell pattern-finding algorithms for extremely large data sets. They theorize that Amazon wants to move beyond its cloud services businesses -- which rents data storage and raw computing power -- and add to these offerings analysis software that can be rented, and possibly modified, to suit a company's needs.
2012-01-09	Selling Kindles Back to Amazon	For a couple of months now, Amazon has practically begged you to buy a Kindle Fire. Maybe you did. And maybe you are insanely happy that you can now spend hours on the couch playing Angry Birds rather than reading some boring old book, which is all you could do on your old Kindle. Sure, you could give that rejected Kindle to an aging relative who is faithful to the old ways of literacy. Now you have another option: sell it to Amazon for real money, or at least a near-equivalent -- an Amazon gift card.

2011-12-20	Amazon Makes the Fire Less Balky	The Kindle Fire, Amazon's color touchscreen tablet, is flying off the virtual shelves, the company says. Its price tag is $200 - and that's all many consumers think they need to know.
2011-12-19	The Kindle Fire And a Debate On Tablets	My article in The New York Times on Monday citing high levels of dissatisfaction with Amazon's new tablet generated a torrential response, much of it from people who said they loved their Kindle Fires. The wilder commentators suggested that the whole article somehow came from Apple, which, in their view, was trying to get people to hock grandma's jewels to buy $500 iPads. None of those conspiracy theorists explained why so many original users of the Fire put mixed to negative reviews on Amazon's own site. The uproar underlined yet again how people have deep-seated but contradictory feelings about their devices. In one sense, they demand a lot; in another, they are very forgiving. No one would put up with a new car that did not drive well, but people expect technology to be balky, at least in the beginning. One commentator, Victor from Texas, captured this charity in one sentence: ''Though I am not thrilled with this initial version of Fire, I have no intention of returning it since it works well for me.''

2011-12-15	Small Businesses And Amazon	For years - since its inception - Amazon has been at implicit war with local brick-and-mortar stores. Last week, the implicit seemingly became explicit when Amazon began a promotion that encouraged customers to check out prices at local retailers and use a specially designed ''Price Check'' smartphone app to report what they found back to Amazon. Customers who then purchased the same item from Amazon received a 5 percent discount, up to $5. (The deal was available only from Friday night through Saturday, and only for certain kinds of products.) For its initiative, Amazon has been greeted with a barrage of rotten tomatoes, from the press and from small businesses and their sympathizers. (Gawker, for one, described it as ''a Christmas attack on local shops'' and a ''cheap, sad thing.'') On Thursday, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, the top Republican on the Small Business Committee, joined the fray. ''Incentivizing consumers to spy on local shops is a bridge too far,'' she said in a statement. ''During the busiest shopping season of the year, we should remember that our local restaurants, bookshops and hardware stores are the economic engines in our communities.'' Ms. Snowe urged Amazon to cancel the promotion.

2006-04-24	Everyone's an Editor as Wiki Fever Spreads to Shopping Sites	MILLIONS of people have lent their wisdom -- or their perceived wisdom, at least -- to Wikipedia's online articles, helping to make it one of the more talked-about Web sites in recent years. Now Amazon.com and the people who built the online advertising pioneer DoubleClick are hoping millions more will wax authoritative about toasters, fondue pots and lawn mowers. ShopWiki.com, developed by two DoubleClick founders, officially introduced its site last week after several months of testing, while Amazon pulled the ''beta'' tag off its own wiki offering earlier this month (Amazon's ProductWikis -- or invitations to write them -- are found on product pages below customer reviews). Both take a page from Wikipedia, where online denizens may write on any subject and also overwrite anyone else's comments if they think they can do better, or if they are just feeling ornery.
2006-03-20	Amazon Says Technology, Not Ideology, Skewed Results	Amazon.com last week modified its search engine after an abortion rights organization complained that search results appeared skewed toward anti-abortion books. Until a few days ago, a search of Amazon's catalog of books using the word ''abortion'' turned up pages with the question, ''Did you mean adoption?'' at the top, followed by a list of books related to abortion.
2006-03-19	Book, How Do I Love Thee? Let Me Count the Words	WHO would compare ''The Story of Babar'' to the prize-winning novel ''Everything Is Illuminated''? Who would call James Joyce's ''Ulysses,'' the bane of many an undergrad, a work for a seventh grader? With the aid of software at Amazon.com known as Text Stats, anyone can make such comparisons, which are based on the crudest sort of computer analysis of a book: how many big words there are, and how long the sentences run.
2006-03-10	Amazon Considering Downloads	Amazon.com is in talks with three Hollywood studios about starting a service that would allow consumers to download movies and TV shows for a fee and burn them onto DVD's, according to three people briefed on the discussions. If the advanced negotiations are successfully concluded, Amazon's service would position itself in the media world alongside rivals like Apple Computer's iTunes as a place where people go not just to order goods to be sent by mail, but to instantly enjoy digital wares as well.
2006-03-03	Toys 'R' Us Wins Ruling in Amazon Dispute	Toys ''R'' Us won a lawsuit yesterday against Amazon.com that will allow the toy seller to set up its own Web site and end an agreement to sell products on Amazon's site. Judge Margaret Mary McVeigh of New Jersey Superior Court ruled that Amazon breached a contract from 2000 that called for Toys ''R'' Us to pay $50 million in annual fees to be Amazon's exclusive online toy merchant. Toys ''R'' Us sued Amazon in 2004, claiming Amazon had allowed third parties to sell toys on its site.
2006-03-02	Senate Bill to Address Fears of Blocked Access to Net	Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, will introduce new legislation today that would prohibit Internet network operators from charging companies for faster delivery of their content to consumers or favoring some content providers over others. The bill is meant to ease growing fears that open Internet access may be blocked or compromised by the Bell phone carriers and cable operators, which may create tiers of service for delivering content to consumers, much the way the post office charges more for overnight mail delivery than for regular delivery.
2006-02-18	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about plans by Amazon.com to offer a digital music player to challenge the iPod misstated the number of iPods sold last year by Apple Computer. It was 32 million; 14 million was the figure for the fourth quarter.
2006-02-17	Amazon Will Take On iPod With Its Own Music Player	Amazon.com is preparing to take on Apple Computer in digital music by introducing its own portable music player that would be linked to an online music service, according to several music industry executives involved with negotiations with Amazon. Unlike Apple, which sells songs for 99 cents each, Amazon will offer a service that charges a monthly or annual fee to customers, who will have the right to fill up their music players with as many songs as they like, the executives said. When they stop paying the fee, the music on the player will be disabled.

2006-02-12	You Hate Me, You Really Hate Me	I've never had trouble understanding the appeal of book clubs. Though of course some are coed or all-male, most have a distinctly female tone that seamlessly blends the quotidian and the literary; they're one of the few places where you might hear cellulite and Tolstoy mentioned in the same conversation. Also, they often involve the consumption of white wine. As far as I'm concerned, these are all selling points. And yet when I began visiting book clubs after my first novel, ''Prep,'' was published, I found that my experiences were not the estrogen-suffused love fests I'd envisioned.
2006-02-03	Amazon's Profit Fell 43% in Its 4th Quarter	Amazon, the giant online retailer, reported late Thursday that its profit declined 43 percent during the holiday quarter, in large part because of a reduced tax benefit. Without special items, the company reported revenue that was slightly lower than expected, along with much higher expenses.
2006-01-19	Heeere's Bill Maher, Live on Amazon	Not content with selling everything from books to exercise equipment online, the Web retailer Amazon.com is starting its own weekly talk show, presented over the Internet with the comedian Bill Maher as host. The half-hour show, called ''Amazon Fishbowl,'' will have a format familiar to any late-night television viewer, with a monologue by Mr. Maher, followed by an interview with an author, a conversation with a filmmaker and a performance by a musician or musical group.
2005-12-27	A Chance To Meet The Author Online	Shoppers looking to pick up Meg Wolitzer's latest novel, ''The Position,'' on Amazon.com last week found the usual readers' comments and excerpts from reviews. They also found something unexpected: posts on the subject of literature from Ms. Wolitzer herself. The entries were part of a new program called Amazon Connect, begun late last month to enhance the connections between authors and their fans -- and to sell more books -- with author blogs and extended personal profile pages on the company's online bookstore site. So far, Amazon has recruited a group of about a dozen authors, including novelists, writers of child care manuals and experts on subjects as diverse as real estate investing, science, fishing and the lyrics of the Grateful Dead.
2005-12-22	Treating Guests To a Cloud Of Comfort	THREE years ago we moved smack into the middle of what passes for a downtown in Northern California on the theory that it was preferable to have the teenagers set up headquarters at our house, where we could spy on them easily, rather than slink over to someone else's. The theory proved correct, insofar as it went. Attracted by our proximity to the local movie theater, the pizza parlor and many top-notch baristas, my daughters and their friends generally can be found draped across my furniture.
2005-11-21	Railing at Sony BMG, Disguised as a Review	IN a limited experiment launched earlier this month, the online retailer Amazon.com began allowing about half of its registered customers to post and view ''tags'' on products -- essentially words or short phrases that act like virtual post-it notes. This was designed to help shoppers mark items for later consideration (''gift for mom,'' for example), or to classify products by some personal metric (''exercise music,'' perhaps, or ''wedding tunes''). Of course, a survey of recent tags -- which, unless they are specifically made private, are designed to be viewed by the public -- reveals that snarky Internet shoppers have quickly turned Amazon.com's tagging system into digital graffiti.
2005-11-14	One Well-Read Home Has Some New Pets: 1,082 Penguins	Rushing to evacuate her home as a forest fire lapped at the edges of this high-desert town in May 2000, Kathryn Gursky took with her just one book, a British edition of ''The World of Pooh,'' by A. A. Milne, bought when she and her husband were vacationing in Dorset some 11 years earlier. When she returned to Los Alamos after the fire, Ms. Gursky, a 49-year-old former librarian, found that the rest of her 2,300-volume personal library had burned, along with her house and everything in it.
2005-11-13	Mysteries of the Amazon	My search through the wish lists on Amazon.com yielded five results. I could immediately rule out the Jeff of Athens, Ohio. ''Jeff r'' seemed too capricious with the shift key to be the right person, and his taste in DVD's (''The Cannonball Run''? ''Aces: Iron Eagle III''?) seemed all wrong. But the third Jeff had filled out his ''Unique Facts'' section: ''New to the city,'' he'd written -- just as he'd mentioned at the party where I met him. ''Likes: baseball, indie films, radio comedy.'' This definitely was the Jeff that I knew. Well, knew a little. And liked. Maybe like liked: he did, after all, want the ''Freaks and Geeks'' boxed set.
2005-11-04	Want 'War and Peace' Online? How About 20 Pages at a Time?	In a race to become the iTunes of the publishing world, Amazon.com and Google are both developing systems to allow consumers to purchase online access to any page, section or chapter of a book. These programs would combine their already available systems of searching books online with a commercial component that could revolutionize the way that people read books. The idea is to do for books what Apple has done for music, allowing readers to buy and download parts of individual books for their own use through their computers rather than trek to a store or receive them by mail. Consumers could purchase a single recipe from a cookbook, for example, or a chapter on rebuilding a car engine from a repair manual.
2005-10-26	Harry Potter Gave Amazon Only So Much	Amazon.com, the online retail company, reported yesterday that its profit declined in the third quarter, partly as a result of a legal settlement, while sales of the latest Harry Potter book helped increase revenue by 27 percent. The company's net income fell some 44 percent in the period, to $30 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with $54.1 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 27 percent, to $1.86 billion, from $1.46 billion a year earlier, and were largely in line with forecasts. Excluding the effects of the legal settlement of $40 million, earnings would have been $50 million, or 12 cents a share, the company said, 2 cents more than analysts forecast.
2005-10-10	Amazon in Cross-Fire Of Battling Reviewers	Some people make a living passionately trying to persuade Americans that they are tricked into paying income taxes. Just as zealous are self-styled consumer advocates, who seek to warn the unwary about what they see as illegal tax-evasion schemes pitched by anti-tax protestors. Last week Amazon.com was drawn into the fray when it was persuaded, at least briefly, to censor comments cautioning readers about a book on taxes.
2005-09-01	A Baby Step Toward Wi-Fi Photos	EVERY now and then, someone combines two technologies into a single new product, and the result is a triumphant new category that changes the industry. Clock + radio. Cellphone + camera. Music player + hard drive. But of all possible combinations these days, few are more screamingly obvious than wireless + camera. Already, millions of people snap photos with their cellphones, then gleefully e-mail them or post them on Web sites. But why should you be satisfied with the crummy, low-resolution, bleached-out photos from cellphones? Why shouldn't you be able to have the same kind of fun with really good photos, from really good cameras?
2005-07-28	Reading Between the Lines of Used Book Sales	THE Internet is a bargain hunter's paradise. Ebay is an easy example, but there are many places for deals on used goods, including Amazon.com. While Amazon is best known for selling new products, an estimated 23 percent of its sales are from used goods, many of them secondhand books. Used bookstores have been around for centuries, but the Internet has allowed such markets to become larger and more efficient. And that has upset a number of publishers and authors.
2005-07-27	Rise in Sales At Amazon Lifts Shares	Amazon.com, the online retail giant, reported yesterday that its profit had declined 32 percent in the second quarter, mainly because of income tax expenses. Sales rose sharply, though, and its shares jumped in after-hours trading. Net income for the company, based in Seattle, was $52 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with $76 million, or 18 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2004. The report included $56 million in income tax expenses associated with the transfer abroad of operating assets from the United States; the company had $5 million in such expenses a year ago.
2005-07-24	Amazonian	When Amazon.com released its Musicians Hall of Fame this month, ranking the Top 25-selling CD's in the site's 10-year history, a few of the results might have been surprising -- Enya at No. 8? -- but all the names on the list were recognizable stars. Except one: No. 5, Eva Cassidy. Cassidy, right, was an angelic-voiced but little-known singer whose death from cancer at 33, in 1996, inspired a phenomenal demand for her renditions of songbook standards, jazz and gospel, leading to six posthumous albums culled from unreleased recordings. She's not necessarily out of place on Amazon's list, which skews wildly toward white pop-rock (the only solo black artist is Ray Charles at No. 23) and hardly reflects album sales beyond Amazon. But ahead of Bob Dylan (No. 9), Bruce Springsteen (No. 12) and Elvis (No. 25)? The explanation probably lies in the rise of the Internet as a tastemaker, and the explosive growth of online commerce that Amazon itself pioneered. The independent Blix Street label began releasing Cassidy's recordings in 1998, the year Amazon added music to its inventory. A word-of-mouth campaign, fueled by chat rooms and fan sites, began to seep into the news media, and by December 2000 two Cassidy albums had pushed a top-selling Beatles compilation down to No. 3 at Amazon, with three other Cassidy albums at Nos. 4, 5 and 7. Just how many CD's she has sold on Amazon to reach No. 5 is unknown; the company does not release sales information other than comparative rankings. But thanks to Amazon consumers, Eva Cassidy is enjoying an unlikely, and lucrative, sort of immortality. JOEL TOPCIK
2005-07-18	Potter Book Sets Record In First Day	Scholastic Inc. said yesterday that an estimated 6.9 million copies of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' were sold in the United States in the first 24 hours the book was on sale, smashing the one-day sales record of 5 million set two years ago by the previous installment in the popular series. But retailers also began to lower their prices almost immediately and in one case offered earlier customers partial refunds, signaling that millions of copies remain available in bookstores, warehouses and used-book outlets.
2005-07-10	A Retail Revolution Turns 10	THE image in Mark R. Anderson's head was that of an airplane struggling to gain altitude. Mr. Anderson, one of the technology world's more highly regarded pundits, watched a speck of a company called Amazon.com grow from a three-person start-up in a converted garage into a publicly traded corporation that came to symbolize both the best and the worst of the dot-com era. Mr. Anderson publishes The Strategic News Service, an influential newsletter read by the likes of Bill Gates and Michael Dell, and prides himself on being able to predict the future. But he acknowledged that he had been dubious of Amazon and its charismatic chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, and for a time had believed Amazon was more likely to crash than to attain cruising altitude.
2005-06-30	Harry Potter and the Preordering of the Prince	THE last time a new Harry Potter book was published, strict rules of conduct were established in my household. With a single copy to share, my two oldest daughters devised a plan to read it simultaneously. Each girl got the book for a five-hour period, after which she had to mark her place and relinquish it -- without pinching or hair pulling -- to her sister. For three days reading proceeded around the clock, at intervals enforced by stopwatch.
2005-06-23	On the Go With Music And Now, Video	Cowon Systems has long been making portable music players that include features like built-in voice recorders and radios. The Cowon iAudio X5 adds the ability to show videos. Just as songs must be compressed into space-saving formats like MP3, videos played on the iAudio X5 involve some technical compromise. Before downloading, videos must be converted into compressed MPEG-4 files using software supplied by Cowon. To further conserve the iAudio's hard-drive space, the software converts its visual entertainment to 15-frames-a-second playback, half the standard rate in North America.
2005-06-02	In for a Penny, Buy by the Pound	MY family consumes books the way monkeys go through bananas. With five of us devouring them and discarding the depleted skins wherever they might fall, novels litter the house. ''The Catcher in the Rye'' and ''Lord of the Flies,'' staples for teenagers, are abandoned on the kitchen table. ''Little Women'' and ''Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle'' have turned the staircase into an obstacle course. Saul Bellow's early novels? They're filed on a chair in the upstairs hall.
2005-05-05	Now, iButtons for the iPod; Soon, iCuff Links and iTie?	As any owner of the original Sony Walkman will tell you, there's something uniquely satisfying about the feel of real buttons. This feeling of fingertip control seems to be the guiding inspiration behind a new iPod accessory called the iTop Button Relocator.
2005-05-03	Corrections	Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the long-term strategy at Amazon.com misstated the decline in the share price on Friday. It was 0.5 percent, not 5 percent.
2005-05-02	At Amazon.com, Growth Comes Ahead of Profit	Bad news is relative if you're an investor in the online retail giant Amazon.com. Last Tuesday, Amazon reported its quarterly earnings after the close of the markets. In its three previous reports, Amazon presented its numbers to Wall Street and then watched its stock tumble between 12 percent and 15 percent over the next 24 hours.
2005-04-27	Amazon's Net Income Falls Despite a 24% Revenue Rise	Amazon.com, the online retailer, said yesterday that its net income fell in the first quarter despite a 24 percent rise in revenue, as costs from technology investments and shipping promotions offset higher sales. The company's profit fell to $78 million, or 18 cents a share, in the first quarter, from $111 million, or 26 cents a share, a year ago. The figures for the latest quarter include $56 million income tax expense.
2005-04-24	How to Be Your Own Publisher	When Amy Fisher finished writing her memoir about shooting her lover's wife, she told her agent not to send the manuscript to New York publishers. Instead, Fisher, who made headlines in 1992 as the 17-year-old ''Long Island Lolita,'' turned to iUniverse in Lincoln, Neb. The company charges authors several hundred dollars to convert a manuscript into a book and make it available for sale online. Fisher's ''If I Knew Then,'' which came out in September, is probably the first sure-fire success to start out under the imprint of a so-called self-publishing company. (Other self-published books, notably ''The Celestine Prophecy'' and ''The Christmas Box,'' became best sellers, but their success was a surprise to the publishing industry.)
2005-04-21	Arts, Briefly	The Pope and the Wizard Harry Potter was toppled by the new pope yesterday from his perch atop the German book charts, Reuters reported. After the German cardinal Joseph Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI, his books jumped to the top four places in the German Amazon.com rankings, and three more of his titles, none of them previously in the top 100, turned up in the top 10. His latest book, ''Values in Times of Upheaval,'' above, published only a week ago, was sold out. Reuters also reported that in the United States, eight of the pope's works made it to the Top 20 on the Amazon chart, but advance orders for J.K. Rowling's ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,'' due in July, were strong enough to keep it in Amazon.com's top spot. ''Salt of the Earth,'' a transcript of a long interview given by Cardinal Ratzinger nearly a decade ago, was his leading title in Germany, and also in the United States, where it held No.7 on Amazon. Sting Springs a Surprise Students in a music composition class at the University of Illinois at Chicago got a surprise the other day when a former schoolteacher, whose name happens to be Sting, offered the day's lessons, Reuters reported. Told only that their class was to be filmed for a promotional video for the university, the students burst into cheers when Sting and his band entered through a side door on Monday -- with MTV cameras in tow. He began by playing ''Message in a Bottle,'' one of his hits when he led the rock trio the Police to fame in the 1970's and 80's. He also took questions from the students and discussed influences on his music and composition techniques. ''A blank page terrifies me -- that's why I tour so much,'' he said. ''The more I figure out about music, the more I realize I haven't a clue.'' Before finishing by inviting the students to join him and his band by jamming on his hit ''Every Breath You Take,'' he told them to keep playing music to nourish the soul. The class was filmed for ''Stand In,'' to be seen on Monday on mtvU, an MTV college channel available to 6.4 million students on 700 campuses. Jumping to Conclusions The Chicago Symphony Orchestra cautioned yesterday against reading too much into the conductor Riccardo Muti's statement this week that it had made him an offer. The orchestra, whose music director, Daniel Barenboim, is to leave next year, said in a statement that Mr. Muti, who resigned this month after 19 years at La Scala, had been asked to conduct ''after an absence from our podium of 30 years.'' It added, ''Currently, however, there is no news to report regarding the C.S.O.'s music director search.'' Segal Awards Presented The soprano Anna Christy, below, and the filmmaker Jim McKay were given $5,000 each yesterday in ceremonies at the Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center, where the 2005 Martin E. Segal Awards were presented. The awards, established by the center's board when Mr. Segal retired as chairman in 1986, are given annually to nominees by 2 of its 12 resident arts constituents. Ms. Christy was selected by the New York City Opera, where she recently played Cunégonde in ''Candide''; Mr. McKay was put forward by the Film Society of Lincoln Center.
2005-04-11	Amazon.com, already a proven bookseller, expands into publishing original work with the purchase of BookSurge.	SURE, Amazon.com can sell books. But can it make them? The company itself raised that question, among others, last week when it purchased BookSurge, a book printing business based in Charleston, S.C., that specializes in so-called on-demand printing. BookSurge, which was privately held, is among a handful of companies spawned during the dot-com boom that rely on Internet technology to print a few books at a time, or even one at a time.
2005-03-24	Sizing Up a New Species: Camera-Binoculars	WHY do bird-watchers get up so early? Yeah, yeah -- that's when the birds are the most active, sure. But there may be another reason: if the bird-watchers in your family are the only ones in the field by 5 a.m., who could doubt their claim to have seen the elusive bittern, siskin, shrike or blue-footed booby?
2005-03-21	Gifts.com doesn't know your Aunt Sally. But the company is betting its search engine can recommend a nice present for her.	MARK the date: IAC/InterActiveCorp, the Internet company that became a conglomerate thanks to Barry Diller's open wallet, has actually created a Web business of its own. The company plans today to introduce Gifts.com, a site for helping gift buyers remember and shop for important occasions. InterActiveCorp's entry into this category could spawn a round of new competition among shopping sites and retailers like Amazon.com, which until now have offered a universe of good presents but little help to prospective buyers who want to winnow their choices.
2005-03-10	For Egg-Dying Legions, The Possibilities Abound	NEITHER my brothers nor I grew up to be famous chemists, an outcome that would have surprised anyone who saw us gathered around the kitchen table in the 1970's, preparing to dye Easter eggs. Let others brew weak pastel colors in chipped teacups. The four of us had beakers, test tubes, measuring spoons, Q-tips and eyedroppers lined up in a neat row on the Formica as we prepared for activation. Safety glasses were donned as the first premeasured dose of white vinegar dribbled from the end of a pipette. In the air was a heavy smell of sulfur, which my brothers said came from the eggs.
2005-03-01	CIRCUIT CITY SEVERS TIES TO AMAZON.COM	The electronics retail chain Circuit City Stores said yesterday that it was halting merchandise sales through Amazon.com to focus on its own Web store. Circuit City wants to concentrate on increasing sales at its Internet site rather than continue a three-and-a-half-year relationship with Amazon.com, Bill Cimino, a Circuit City spokesman, said. Separately, the company said that its chief operating officer, John W. Froman, was resigning after 18 years, effective today. The departure of Mr. Froman, 51, comes two weeks after Circuit City got a $3.25 billion takeover offer from Highfields Capital Management, a Boston hedge fund, and promoted its chief merchandising officer, Philip Schoonover, to president. Mr. Cimino said that Circuit City, which is based in Richmond, Va., would announce Mr. Froman's successor shortly.
2005-02-17	Slaking Your Printer's Exotic Thirst	IT struck me recently that buying printers is a lot like buying hamsters. Both are so cute when you get them, not to mention cheap, and the whole family oohs and aahs about the fun times that lie ahead. Only later, when it is time to clean the cage -- or in the case of the printers, to change the ink -- do you realize what a hellish choice you have made. Consider last Sunday night, for example. At 10 p.m., my daughter dropped a bombshell: a high school science report had to be printed. Although the problem at first seemed surmountable -- we own three printers, all with both black and color ink cartridges -- a crisis developed.
2005-02-10	ONLINE DIARY	Eavesdrop and Tell Morgan Friedman's ''Aha!'' moment came at a cafe in Williamsburg, Va., where he overheard a man talking on a cellphone with his girlfriend. Mr. Friedman recounted how the man seemed to become agitated: ''He said to her, 'So you ask me how I'm doing, then I tell you, and then you always bring it back to you.' I thought, that was so funny I need to post this somewhere.''
2005-02-09	Analyzing Sales Of Wolfe's New Book	Few books that spend 12 consecutive weeks on the best-seller list could be called a disappointment. But it appears that ''I Am Charlotte Simmons,'' the latest opus by Tom Wolfe, could be falling into that category. According to Nielsen BookScan, the media-tracking company, ''I Am Charlotte Simmons'' has sold fewer than 250,000 copies from its release in November through the end of January. Even after accounting for BookScan's acknowledgment that it typically measures about 70 percent of total hardcover sales, that would indicate that the book was selling at a slower pace than Mr. Wolfe's two previous novels.
2005-02-06	Is Online Retailing a Victim of Its Own Success?	ONLINE retailers have benefited from some very conspicuous consumption, on their Web sites and especially on Wall Street. Shares of companies in the sector rose nearly 80 percent last year, among the best performances in the entire stock market. But investors seem to have developed a strong case of buyer's remorse. Many companies in the sector are trading lower since the start of this year, including two of the leaders, Amazon.com, down 19.3 percent, and eBay, off 40 percent. The stock of Shopping.com, a site that lets shoppers compare prices from different merchants, is down 33 percent.
2005-02-03	It's Maybe a Bubble, but a Selective One	Is the Internet bubble half empty or half full? With Google's stock on a roll, rising more than 7 percent yesterday to close at $205.96 and prompting some analysts to predict it will hit $290 or more in the coming months, it can seem like the late 1990's again on Wall Street. Shares in Google have been trading for less than six months, but they have risen 142 percent and the company has a market value of $56.2 billion, equal to that of Starbucks, Nike and Southwest Airlines -- combined.
2005-02-03	Price-Comparison Sites Do the Legwork	WE need either a new television set or a new bed. Our bed is a child magnet. It attracts as many as six girls at a time to loll around and watch reruns of ''Friends'' while they talk on cellphones to even more girls who, presumably, need to know in real time how the plot is progressing.
2005-02-03	Amazon.com Earnings Disappoint Investors	Amazon.com, the online retailer, said yesterday that its sales rose 31 percent in the fourth quarter, helped by a tax benefit, but its earnings disappointed investors growing concerned about increased competition and rising expenses. Amazon.com, based in Seattle, reported net income of $346.7 million in the quarter, or 82 cents a share, including a $244 million gain from a tax benefit. The company had a profit of $73.2 million, or 17 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2003.
2005-01-31	Search Sites Play a Game of Constant Catch-Up	Last Monday, Google representatives called analysts and reporters to trumpet a new service that searches the transcripts of television broadcasts. Yahoo, Google's rival, got wind of the announcement and within hours, its publicity machine had bolted into action to say it had a similar service in the works. Perhaps the fiercest competition on the Internet these days is among sites offering new ways to search through more information. Yahoo and Microsoft each have hundreds of engineers trying to challenge Google's leadership, and dozens of minor players are trying to find ways of getting their services noticed. A9, Amazon.com's search service, recently sent vans with digital cameras onto the streets of some cities to take pictures of businesses. The photos were later displayed alongside telephone numbers in A9's phone directory.
2005-01-27	For Local Searchers, Amazon Adds Photos to Yellow Pages	Amazon.com, the online retail giant, plans to introduce a local search service today that can display photos of neighborhood businesses. With the service, Amazon joins Yahoo, Google and many other companies in offering the electronic equivalent of the yellow pages. But the Amazon service, developed by its search-focused subsidiary A9, adds a novel twist: 20 million photos of buildings in 10 major United States cities, with more on the way.
2005-01-24	MediaTalk; Amazon's Ratings Count After All	Rush Limbaugh and Al Franken may have something in common, after all. In Amazon.com's vast customer review database, their books get as many raves as pans. And according to the research of Mikhail Gronas, an assistant professor at Dartmouth, that sells books. Professor Gronas, who teaches Russian literature, used customer reviews on Amazon in order to study how tastes inform what people read. ''Most studies of taste are based on surveys,'' Professor Gronas said. ''With the Amazon.com reviews, you have a huge bank of material that is voluntary.''
2005-01-18	Add to Your Shopping Cart: A Trip to the Edge of Space	Jeff Bezos sells books and practically everything else through Amazon.com, the company that made him a multibillionare. Will space be his next commercial frontier? Mr. Bezos, 41, announced last week that he would build an ''aerospace testing and operations center'' for his space company, Blue Origin, near tiny Van Horn, Tex., on 165,000 acres that he has bought.
2005-01-12	Book Club Takes Steps To Get Out Of Trouble	The Book-of-the-Month Club, a publishing tastemaker for generations of Americans that has seen its membership plunge in recent years, has begun an overhaul that includes the elimination of the panel of literary judges that each month choose the club's prestigious main selection. The popularity of Internet booksellers and the ubiquity of heavily discounted hardcover books at warehouse clubs and mass-market retailers have combined to make the Book-of-the-Month Club -- and other general-interest book clubs -- far less important in the selling of books in the United States. Though they are still very popular in Europe, the only American book clubs that have shown much growth in recent years are specialized clubs with niche subjects like history or medicine or ones that focus on groups like gay readers or African-Americans.
2004-12-30	Customer Service: The Hunt for a Human	TRY to reach customer service at Amazon.com to fix a problem with an order and you will encounter one of the most prominent and frustrating aspects of the Internet era: a world devoid of humans. Not only is there no telephone number on Amazon's Web site, but the company makes a point of not including one. Instead, customers are asked to fill out an online form and wait for a response. ''It's incredibly annoying,'' said Ellen Hobbs of Austin, Tex., whose frustration has led her to publish Amazon.com's customer support number at her own Web site (clicheideas.com/amazon.htm). ''They haven't invested the kind of money in helping you solve problems as they have in selling you things.'' In December alone, some 1,100 people visited Ms. Hobbs's site.
2004-12-29	Digital Goes Mainstream	If books come to mind when you think of Amazon.com, think again. The online retailer reported this week that its sales of consumer electronics surpassed book sales for the first time during the Thanksgiving weekend to become the top sales category on the site.
2004-12-28	Retail in Review: More Bah Than Sis-Boom	As customers crammed stores the day after Christmas, waving their gift cards and seeking the latest markdowns, analysts were there, too -- watching. They offered their latest judgment of the Christmas shopping season yesterday: good, but not great. The analysts, however, were talking mainly about the traditional bricks-and-mortar retail companies. Amazon.com said yesterday that it had set a one-day record during the holiday season of 2.8 million orders (although it did not say which day), adding strength to the strategies of many retailers to beef up or start online stores.
2004-12-13	Holiday slowdowns and crashes at Kmart.com, Amazon.com and others highlight the Web's persistent growing pains.	SOME of the biggest online shopping destinations, including Amazon.com, Kmart and others, have had critical breakdowns during the holiday shopping rush, effectively turning away thousands of customers and doing potentially significant harm to revenues. Early last week, many Amazon customers were unable to access the site at all, turned away at the home page by recurring error messages.
2004-12-07	With So Many Choices, No Wonder You Need Help	SEVERAL years ago, my husband decided to give me a watch for my birthday. To make sure I got one I really liked, he took me to a watch store so I could pick out my favorite. Big mistake.
2004-11-29	Shopping sites offer new features for high-speed users and get surprisingly few complaints from dial-up users.	FOR online merchants and customers alike, the first guilt-free holiday shopping season has arrived. Thanks to the breakneck growth of residential cable modem and D.S.L. services, this is the first year when most Internet users do not have to rely on their workplace for high-speed connections. Instead of hiding the Amazon checkout page when the boss approaches, more shoppers are logging on after work and sparing their nerves.
2004-11-25	Camcorders Finally Find Hard Drives	AS technophiles sit down for Thanksgiving dinner, one thing they can be grateful for is the passing of the magnetic-tape era. The days of storing computer data, music collections and Hollywood movies on spools of tape will soon be completely gone. Sure, tape served its place-holding purpose in technology's march toward hard drives, CD's and DVD's. But when you consider the man-years lost to the Stone Age practice of rewinding and fast-forwarding, tape seems about as modern as Pilgrim hats.
2004-11-25	EBay Sellers Do the Holiday Sprint	YOU think the holidays are hectic? Talk to an eBay Power Seller about the next few weeks, and the realization will dawn: You don't know hectic. These people are turning their living rooms into inventory centers, diving into Dumpsters for spare boxes, stuffing cars and closets with packing peanuts, checking for e-mail every free minute and racing to the post office nearly every afternoon. That's on top of the shopping, decorating, party planning and holiday stress that afflicts everyone else.
2004-11-22	Internet Retailers Reaching Out to Mailbox Surfers	EBay has long been among the Web's most popular destinations. So why is it now making house calls? Last week, millions of people in the United States opened their mailboxes to find a catalog from eBay, a 32-page glossy publication that, fortunately for postal carriers, included just a handful of the 29 million items currently for sale on the site.
2004-10-25	Amazon.com hasn't yet entered the DVD rental business, but prices are tumbling even at the prospect.	AMAZON changed the face of e-commerce categories like music and videos simply by entering those markets. Now the DVD rental industry is shifting course on just the rumor that Amazon will offer a competing service. And although some investors have not been thrilled at that prospect, more consumers will probably be pleased enough to join the market. Netflix, the leading online DVD service, recently dropped its prices 18 percent, to $18 a month for unlimited rentals, after its chief executive said he learned that Amazon would soon offer a competing service. (Amazon refused to confirm the rumor last week.) Blockbuster quickly followed suit, cutting its price to $17.50 from $20.
2004-10-22	Amazon's Profit Triples, Driven by Free Shipping	Amazon.com said yesterday that its profit more than tripled during the third quarter, spurred by an offer of free shipping and a surge in international sales. But the company's guidance for next year failed to top Wall Street's estimates, and its shares fell in after-hours trading. The company's income was $54.1 million, or 13 cents a share, during the third quarter, up from year-earlier net income of $15.6 million, or 4 cents a share. On average, analysts expected Amazon to post a profit of 14 cents a share, or 18 cents a share excluding charges, on sales of $1.47 billion, according to Thomson First Call.
2004-10-22	Earnings Soar, and Share Price Follows	Google Inc.'s already soaring stock price rocketed even higher on Thursday after reporting strong growth in its first quarter as a public company, prompting skeptics to again caution against Googlemania getting out of control. Google, the Internet search engine provider, reported that its profit and revenue more than doubled in the first quarter after its initial public offering. The results led its shares, which had closed up $8.89, or 6.33 percent, at $149.38, to continue skyward, jumping another 8.25 percent, to $161.70, in after-hours trading. The price was nearly double the initial offering of $85 a share in mid-August.
2004-10-21	Portable Players at Rest Find Life Beyond Earbuds	SOME people have whole walls of their home dedicated to music: a tower of disc players, amplifiers and equalizers, wired to at least two but maybe even seven speakers, along with a subwoofer. You may not be like that. Maybe you spend most of your time out and about, listening to music on your MP3 player in your car or through a pair of increasingly tattered headphones. Maybe you just want to come home, plug your pocket player into something and listen.
2004-10-11	The People Have Spoken, And Rice Takes Offense	Lestat, the vampire narrator of Anne Rice's most recent book, ''Blood Canticle,'' begins the novel with a harangue against its readers. ''What the hell happened when I gave you 'Memnoch the Devil?''' he asks crossly, referring to an earlier novel by Ms. Rice that some readers, to put it mildly, did not like. ''You complained!'' Many people did not care much for ''Blood Canticle'' (Knopf) either, as Ms. Rice found to her mounting horror when she began scrolling through dozens of virulently negative reviews of the book on Amazon.com.
2004-10-08	New Google Service May Strain Old Ties in Bookselling	Google Print, the new search engine that allows consumers to search the content of books online, could help touch off an important shift in the balance of power between companies that produce books and those that sell them, publishing executives said here on Thursday. Google announced the introduction of the service at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the industry's most important annual meeting, where publishers, authors and their agents convene to buy and sell the rights to publish books in countries worldwide.

2004-09-23	A Guide for Your Big-Ticket Safari	WHEN I started writing this column five years ago, nobody knew how the Internet would change the way we shop. Back then people believed in magic. Nearly every week I tried a wacky new high-concept approach to shopping. At one grocery site, now defunct, I submitted bids for milk and eggs. Another time, when foot-powered scooters were the rage, I bought two from a long-gone haggling site where software-powered ''salesmen'' with names like Vinnie negotiated the prices. Once I got a salad spinner as a giveaway from yet another extinct site where shoppers could form bulk buying groups to make purchases at wholesale prices.
2004-09-15	Amazon to Take Searches On Web to a New Depth	Amazon.com, the e-commerce giant, plans to take aim at the Internet search king Google with an advanced technology that the company says will take searches beyond mere retrieval of Web pages to let users more fully manage the information they find. A9.com, a start-up owned by Amazon, said in a briefing here on Tuesday that it planned to make the new version of its search service, named A9.com, available Tuesday evening. The service will offer users the ability to store and edit bookmarks on an A9.com central server computer, keep track of each link clicked on previous visits to a Web page, and even make personal ''diary'' notes on those pages for viewing on subsequent visits.
2004-08-03	The Review of Reviews	The beginning of the end came last February, when anonymous book reviews on Amazon.com's Canadian site were posted with reviewers' real names. For some, it was an embarrassing unmasking. Several authors had raved about their own books. A number of reviewers had tried to skew the Amazon system, supporting friends or attacking enemies with anonymous or pseudonymous reviews. What kept this from being merely laughable is the scale of Amazon's business and the role customers' reviews play in its social and financial economy. Like eBay, Amazon.com is a community, and trust is one of its most important commodities. Just visit Amazon's discussion boards if you don't believe it. That's why Amazon recently stopped accepting anonymous customer reviews, replacing them with a program called Real Names. Reviewers who use their own names will have a Real Name badge posted next to their reviews. (Pen Names are permitted, but they're less acceptable.) According to its Web site, Amazon believes that ''a community in which people use their Real Names will ultimately have higher-quality content.''
2004-07-24	AMAZON.COM SHARES HAVE BIGGEST DECLINE IN TWO YEARS	Shares of Amazon.com Inc., the Internet retailer, fell 13 percent, their biggest decline in more than two years, after the company reported that second-quarter profit and sales were less than analysts' estimates. Amazon.com said yesterday that profit, excluding certain costs, was one cent less than the 19-cent average estimate. Revenue of $1.39 billion was also lower than analysts expected. The chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, faced difficult year-ago sales comparisons, when Amazon.com sold 1.4 million copies of the fifth installment of the ''Harry Potter'' children's book series. The company, based in Seattle, posted net income of $76.5 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $43.3 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 26 percent, to $1.39 billion from $1.01 billion a year earlier, the lowest rise in two years.
2004-07-23	Amazon Reports a Profit But Misses Expectations	Amazon.com said yesterday that it swung to a profit in the second quarter, but its shares dropped sharply in after-hours trading because the results missed analysts' expectations. The company, based in Seattle, reported net income of $76.5 million, or 18 cents a share, missing analysts' forecasts of 19 cents. That is in contrast to a loss of $43.3 million, or 11 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
2004-07-20	So Many Field Guides You Need A Guide	As the world rushes at 100 megabytes per second into a digitized, fragmented future that sometimes seems downright hostile to rational thought, a ray of hope has emerged. I have found, on my desk, evidence that reason, or at least something vaguely 19th century, may rise again. I am talking about the field guide.
2004-07-12	E-Commerce Report; As online sales soar for used books, the publishing industry's fears may sound hauntingly familiar to the music industry.	IS Amazon.com becoming the Napster of the book business? The analogy may not be far off, say some observers of the used-book industry. Publishers, particularly textbook publishers, have long countered used-book sales by churning out new editions every couple of years. But the Web, particularly sites like Amazon and eBay, have given millions of consumers an easy way to find cheap books -- often for under $1 -- without paying royalty fees to publishers or authors.
2004-07-06	You've Got Mail (and Court Says Others Can Read It)	When everything is working right, an e-mail message appears to zip instantaneously from the sender to the recipient's inbox. But in reality, most messages make several momentary stops as they are processed by various computers en route to their destination. Those short stops may make no difference to the users, but they make an enormous difference to the privacy that e-mail is accorded under federal law.
2004-05-25	Toys 'R' Us Sues Amazon.com Over Exclusive Sales Agreement	Toys ''R'' Us has accused Amazon.com of breaking the contract that gave Toys ''R'' Us the right to be the exclusive toy and game seller on Amazon's site. The charges were made in a lawsuit filed Friday in state court in Passaic County, N.J., where Toys ''R'' Us is based.
2004-04-23	Sales Abroad Help Amazon Post a Profit In 1st Quarter	Amazon.com reported first-quarter earnings of $111 million on Thursday, its first profit in a nonholiday quarter, led by lower prices and surging international sales. But shares of Amazon, the big Internet retailer, fell after hours as investors expressed skepticism that the company's low-price strategy would lead to sustained growth and long-term profit.
2004-04-22	Economic Scene; Selection ranks above price among the benefits of shopping online.	WHAT is so great about Internet commerce? To many economists, the answer is simple: lower prices. With a world of suppliers available at the click of a mouse, buyers can easily find out who has the best deals. Online commerce looks something like the blackboard model of perfect competition.

2004-03-05	Cold Spring Journal; A Sequel for an Endangered Bookstore?	In this storybook village dotted with antique shops and gingerbread-trimmed cottages, residents and tourists have been mourning the imminent demise of yet another independent bookstore. With its wide-planked floors painted a pale gray and in-depth offerings in history and political science, Salmagundi Books is a favorite place to browse after taking in the Hudson River scenery at the foot of Main Street, a cerebral crossroads for writers and artists in the area. Perhaps more important, it is also the last general-interest bookstore in Putnam County.
2004-02-19	Amazon's Book Reviews Invite Mischief	To the Editor: Re ''Amazon Glitch Unmasks War of Reviewers'' (front page, Feb. 14):
2004-02-19	Amazon's Book Reviews Invite Mischief	To the Editor: ''Amazon Glitch Unmasks War of Reviewers'' (front page, Feb. 14) has finally revealed the laissez-faire practices of Amazon.com's reviewing system. The article deals mostly with fiction, however. But in the world of nonfiction, any competing author can post a review, negative or positive, and lie about the content or veracity of a reference book. This has turned the review sections into bizarre, vitriolic chat rooms, which may entertain but ultimately do not help the customer make a good purchase.
2004-02-19	Amazon's Book Reviews Invite Mischief	To the Editor: Amazon.com could greatly reduce the number of misleading book reviews (front page, Feb. 14) if it accepted reviews only from people who actually bought the book.
2004-02-19	Amazon's Book Reviews Invite Mischief	To the Editor: ''Amazon Glitch Unmasks War of Reviewers'' (front page, Feb. 14) portrays the community of literary writers as a nest of immature, insecure vipers who wait for the dark of night to scrawl anonymous graffiti on one another's work. Since 1996, I've bought hundreds of books from Amazon.com. The first 10 or 20 reader reviews I read included one or two credible ones. Most of the others contained errors in grammar, syntax or spelling, or otherwise revealed that the reviewer was far from fully familiar with the context in which the book should be judged.
2004-02-14	Amazon Glitch Unmasks War Of Reviewers	Close observers of Amazon.com noticed something peculiar this week: the company's Canadian site had suddenly revealed the identities of thousands of people who had anonymously posted book reviews on the United States site under signatures like ''a reader from New York.'' The weeklong glitch, which Amazon fixed after outed reviewers complained, provided a rare glimpse at how writers and readers are wielding the online reviews as a tool to promote or pan a book -- when they think no one is watching.
2004-01-28	Amazon Reports First Full-Year Profit	Sales that were better than expected, buoyed by a falling dollar that helped lift results overseas, led Amazon.com to earn $73 million in the fourth quarter, giving the company its first full-year profit. But shares of Amazon, the once-struggling online retailer that has secured a position as one of the best-known brand names on the Internet, fell sharply in after-hours trading yesterday as investors worried that the company's price-cutting strategy would erode its long-term profit potential.
2004-01-25	Chance to Give Via Amazon	You can buy books on Amazon.com, along with action figures or digital cameras. And now, you can buy into the presidential race as well. Amazon.com, the online mega-merchant, is taking retail politics to a new level, allowing shoppers to contribute to candidates with a credit card and the click of a mouse.
2003-12-22	E-Commerce Report; The returns are early, but the new categories of 'stores' on Amazon.com are showing signs of promise.	AS in other recent holiday seasons, Amazon.com Inc. this year has successfully peddled the staples -- books, music and videos -- of online gift shoppers. But how about those alligator tenderloins, Callaway drivers and Mikimoto pearls? Amazon.com is wrapping up its first holiday season in which it has featured such goods and others in distinct ''stores,'' or categories. Since September it has opened four stores: gourmet food, sporting goods, jewelry and watches, and (just last week) health and personal care. Retailers who are participating in the new stores and analysts who have watched them closely said Amazon.com's sales in those categories had shown promise. ''We're hearing that sales are good, not great,'' said Carrie A. Johnson, an analyst with Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm. ''But they're good enough, and that's the key for retailers who've spent a lot of time integrating with Amazon.''
2003-12-18	Google Experiment Provides Internet With Book Excerpts	Google, the Internet search engine, has begun an experiment with book publishers in which the contents of the first chapters of books, reviews or other bibliographic information is indexed and made available to Web surfers. Although the experiment, called Google Print, was begun quietly earlier this month, the company described its test on Wednesday in general terms after Google users began noticing the content in their information searches. Google executives were quick to point out that the company now considers the service to be a test, or ''beta,'' version, and it is not generating revenue from either the search information or from ads or other related information that appear on the retrieved pages.
2003-12-03	The Search for the Perfect Gift: Just a Click, Not a Drive, Away	When someone types ''Christmas light sets'' into the Web search engine Google, the second listing, after a government recall notice, is the site for Aubuchon Hardware, a family-run chain of New England hardware stores. As a result, Aubuchon is now selling more light sets in California than in Massachusetts, its home state. The best-selling item last week on Amazon.com's new specialty meat department was the ''élevages magret duck breast'' from Fossil Farms, a wild game farm in Lakeville, Pa. The duck beat out the top sirloin offered on the site by Omaha Steaks, the giant mail-order butcher.
2003-11-06	In Amazon's Text Search, a Field Day for Book Browsers	DAVID SMITH, a product manager in Seattle, knows of the hubbub surrounding Amazon.com's new feature, Search Inside the Book. The service, introduced two weeks ago, allows people to do keyword searches within the text of books before buying them. Predictions about the future of books have been swirling in the air ever since. Will people stop buying books, since they are now able to view and print the pages they want without paying for them? Will they buy more books, because they will be better able to find what they need? What will happen to that time-honored tradition of standing for hours in the library or bookstore, thumbing through page after page?
2003-10-28	Google Studies Creation of Book Database	Google.com has begun talks with book publishers to compile a searchable database of the contents of thousands of volumes, a publishing executive briefed on the project said yesterday. A spokesman for Google, David Krane, declined to comment.
2003-10-27	Amazon Offer Worries Authors	The online retailer Amazon.com has introduced a feature that lets users search for specific words or phrases in a database of the texts of 120,000 books, drawing skepticism from an authors' group. The feature, called Search Inside the Book, lets anyone see a few pages of each book in which the phrase appears. Registered users can see up to 20 pages of a book at a time.

2003-10-22	Helped by Pricing Strategy, Amazon.com Reports Profit	Amazon.com yesterday reported its first profit outside of the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday season, as its strategy to reignite growth with lower prices continues to pay off. Amazon, which some investors wrote off as being on the brink of insolvency a few years ago, is now generating cash at a steady clip. Its low prices and increasing selection of goods from other merchants have accelerated its growth in North America. Its sales are still growing rapidly in Europe and Japan, but the pace of growth is slowing overseas, largely as a result of increased price- cutting and offers of free shipping in many countries.
2003-10-20	Passing the Word	Reasonably priced secure downloads. Compensation for writers and artists. Peaceful alliances between publishers and online distributors. A utopian vision for the music industry? Perhaps. But that approach, which appears to be the goal of Apple Computer's iTunes music store and others like it, is already a reality for delivering audio books and other spoken word offerings over the Internet, as created by Audible, a small company in Wayne, N.J.
2003-09-29	E-Commerce Report; As Amazon moves into sporting goods, online retailers wonder whether to see it as a competitor or a partner.	THE giant of e-commerce is dipping its toe into another new market, and, as usual, the ripple effects are considerable. Amazon, of course, is the giant. And its official entry into the $1.5 billion online sporting goods market last week capped a yearlong effort to add a group of products that have posed difficult challenges for offline merchandisers but have proved well suited to online commerce. Now, the e-commerce companies that have been finding success in sporting goods are watching to see whether Amazon emerges as competitor, a partner or both.
2003-09-23	Technology Briefing | Internet: Amazon.com Adds Sports Products	Amazon.com Inc. has signed up more than 90 companies, including Foot Locker Inc., to help it expand into sporting goods, a growing sales category for online merchants. Amazon.com, which began testing sales of sports items a month ago, is offering equipment, clothing and other items for more than 50 sports. The company will receive a commission for operating the store and processing orders for its partners, who will provide inventory, handle shipments and customer service, a company spokeswoman, Kristin Schaefer, said. Amazon.com said it might add more sporting-goods partners and merchandise to the site, which now has about 95 retailers like SportsLine.com Inc., and the Sports ''R'' Us unit of Toys ''R'' Us. Shares of Amazon.com dropped 11 cents, to $47.47. Shares of SportsLine.com rose 32 cents, or 18 percent, to $2.10. Amazon.com has been increasing offerings by teaming with traditional and other Web retailers to sell items through the site. Last year it opened an apparel and shoe store, signing up partners that included Gap Inc. The company is offering a $10 certificate to people who spend at least $50 at the sporting-goods shop.
2003-09-11	ONLINE DIARY	Gender Genie Does your writing style indicate whether you are male or female? In a development reported in The New York Times Magazine and elsewhere, Israeli researchers recently created an algorithm that can predict the sex of an author from a writing sample. After the news coverage, some cheeky members of an online book discussion site, BookBlog, turned the algorithm into a Web application called Gender Genie (www.bookblog.net/gender/genie.html) that allows anyone to punch in some prose and receive a verdict. That's when the fun started. Since Aug. 15, Gender Genie has analyzed 250,000 documents submitted by 125,000 people, according to Mary Delli Santi, who runs the site. But although the researchers achieved an 80 percent accuracy rate, Gender Genie correctly guessed an author's sex only about half the time.
2003-09-11	Economic Scene; When it comes to books, Internet selling has not led to uniformly low prices.	LIKE every author I know, I'm obsessed with the Amazon ranking of my new book. Several times a day, I check the number on the book's Amazon.com page to see how its sales compare with sales of every other book. Best-seller lists rank just the top 10 or 20 books. Amazon ranks more than two million -- every book it sells. Authors love the rankings at Amazon and its competitor, BarnesandNoble.com (also known as BN.com), because they give us real-time information on how well a book is selling. Aside from satisfying anxious curiosity, the rankings provide immediate feedback on the effect of reviews and media appearances.
2003-09-08	E-Commerce Report; Growing concern about fraud is pushing the online world into action. The task looms large, though.	CONSUMERS are losing trust in the Internet, and online companies are taking note. The Information Technology Association of America, a trade group, said last week that it would help create the Coalition on Online Identity Theft, composed of Internet retailers and security companies allied against what has become a significant problem both online and off. Word of the group's formation came eight weeks after the announcement of another industry association, the Merchant Risk Council, which was formed to combat online credit card fraud.
2003-08-27	Technology Briefing | Internet: Amazon Sues To Stop Online Spoofers	Amazon.com Inc., the Internet retailer, said yesterday that it had filed lawsuits to stop a handful of online marketers from illegally using its name. Amazon said it would seek millions of dollars in punitive damages from ''spoofers,'' whose e-mail messages falsely identify the sender. The suits were filed in seven federal district courts in the United States and in the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario.
2003-08-23	AMAZON CHIEF SELLS SHARES IN COMPANY AS STOCK RISES	The chief executive of Amazon.com Inc., Jeffrey P. Bezos, has sold more of his shares in the company, bringing his sales this month to $34.8 million as the stock traded at the highest level in 35 months. Mr. Bezos sold 50,000 shares Thursday, adding to the 800,000 he sold earlier this month, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He reduced his holdings in the company to 106.1 million shares, or about 26.7 percent of the outstanding stock. Mr. Bezos receives an annual salary of about $82,000. He derives most of his wealth from stock in the company and sells at regular intervals under a plan adopted to shield him from accusations of illegal insider trading. Amazon.com is based in Seattle.
2003-08-13	Technology Briefing | Internet: Amazon Extends Sales Pact With Target	Amazon, the world's biggest Internet retailer, yesterday extended its five-year Internet-sales agreement with the Target Corporation, a discount retailer, until August 2008. Under the agreement, Amazon provides order fulfillment and customer service for the Target store at Amazon.com, as well as for Target's online properties, the company said in a statement. Shares of Amazon rose 92 cents, to $39.85. Target shares rose 85 cents, to $40.
2003-07-23	Amazon Cuts Its Loss as Sales Increase	Amazon.com, citing a sharp increase in sales, said yesterday that it cut its loss in half for the second quarter. The company, the largest general retailer on the Internet, said its strategy of discount prices and free shipping was the largest contributor to its growth. Sales increased by 37 percent, to $1.1 billion, benefiting from the euro's rise, which increased the dollar value of its European sales by $55 million. If exchange rates had been the same as a year ago, Amazon's sales would have increased by 30 percent.
2003-07-21	Amazon Plan Would Allow Searching Texts Of Many Books	Executives at Amazon.com are negotiating with several of the largest book publishers about an ambitious and expensive plan to assemble a searchable online archive with the texts of tens of thousands of books of nonfiction, according to several publishing executives involved. Amazon plans to limit how much of any given book a user can read, and it is telling publishers that the plan will help sell more books while better serving its own online customers.
2003-07-12	AMERICA ONLINE DROPS SOME LINKS TO AMAZON.COM	America Online has started a service to sell videos and compact discs online, ending part of its relationship with Amazon.com Inc. America Online is selling the products directly on its entertainment Web site and is removing some links to Amazon.com's online store, Bill Wilson, senior vice president of AOL Entertainment, said. America Online, a unit of AOL Time Warner, also expects to offer music downloads on its own site by year-end, he said. AOL, which has 26 million subscribers to its Internet access service, has been trying to build its entertainment site's audience by offering exclusive recordings, interviews and other unique material, Mr. Wilson said. America Online and Amazon.com have worked together on marketing since 1997.

2003-05-12	New Economy; New efforts are being made to keep online merchants from collecting personal information from children.	After three years' experience with a federal law meant to protect children's privacy online, privacy-rights groups are trying to expand the number and kinds of commercial Web sites that must comply. A dozen of the groups have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission accusing Amazon.com of soliciting toy reviews from children without making sure their parents had approved their disclosure of personal information. The complaint, filed last month, says that the Toy Store section of Amazon.com, a joint venture with the retailer Toys ''R'' Us, includes reviews of products that were written by children who indicated they were under age 13 and who provided their names, e-mail addresses and, in some cases, their street addresses.
2003-05-01	Making Intelligence A Bit Less Artificial	WHEN Mike Kellogg of Chicago shops at Amazon.com, he can view a list of recommended products that match his taste in music with uncanny precision. The store knows he loves Wilco, a folksy rock band, and offers him CD's with a similar sound. When Anne Heilemann of Iowa City visits Amazon, she is immediately reminded how clueless the recommendations can be. A few months ago she bought a book about flower girls for a friend's 7-year-old daughter, who will be in her wedding this month. Now Amazon offers her more flower-girl books (one is more than enough, Ms. Heilemann said), and assumes that she must also need a book about bargains on baby products.
2003-04-28	Compressed Data; Amazon Site's Child Reviewers Spur Privacy Charge	A privacy complaint filed last week with the Federal Trade Commission argues that contrary to law, some reviewers for the online retailer Amazon.com are children. The complaint, by the Electronic Privacy Information Center and 11 other groups, contended that Amazon violated online privacy laws by posting children's personal information, including home addresses.
2003-04-25	Amazon.com's Loss Shrinks As Free Shipping Lifts Sales	Amazon.com, the Internet retailer, said yesterday that its first-quarter loss narrowed after sales jumped 28 percent, spurred by free shipping and discounts. Its shares climbed 12 percent in late trading. The net loss shrank to $10.1 million, or 3 cents a share, from $23.2 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales rose to $1.08 billion, more than analysts had expected, and Amazon.com increased its revenue forecast for the year.
2003-04-04	Technology Briefing | Deals: Amazon And Google Begin Ad Venture	John Doerr's concept of a keiretsu, or alliance, of Internet companies may have taken some hits, as many of Mr. Doerr's investments have failed, but the concept is not dead. Yesterday, for example, Google, the search engine, said that it would sell advertising for Amazon.com's vast Web store. Terms were not disclosed. Mr. Doerr, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sits on the board of both Amazon and Google. Owen Van Natta, Amazon's vice president for business development, said the arrangement was solely to help users find the products and information they were looking for. For example yesterday, Amazon's page that sold the Bruce Springsteen album ''The Rising'' had a section marked ''customers interested in Bruce Springsteen may also be interested in.'' It had an advertisement, sold by Google, for a Web site selling concert tickets. Companies not in the alliance cannot use this as a back door onto Amazon's site. EBay and Buy.com, both Amazon rivals, buy ads that appear on the Springsteen pages of Google, but are blocked from appearing on Amazon. Saul Hansell(NYT)
2003-02-17	E-Commerce Report; The Battle Over Collecting Taxes for Online Sales Turns Acrimonious	The online tax debate has suddenly become loud and bitter, with Wal-Mart Stores and Amazon.com as the leading antagonists. But the recent activity over Internet sales taxes may have only minimal impact on consumers and tax collectors, many retail executives and industry analysts say. That is because many of the biggest traditional merchants, including Sears, Roebuck; Gap; and Circuit City Stores, have long been collecting sales taxes from their online customers. And the biggest online tax resistors -- Amazon, eBay and Dell Computer -- seem unlikely to start collecting sales taxes any time soon.
2003-02-10	Amazon decides to go for a powerful form of advertising: lower prices and word of mouth.	AMAZON.COM may be most associated with reading, but in many ways its favorite subject is math. The online store's hulking headquarters, looming over Seattle on a foggy hill, is filled with spreadsheet-toting analysts calculating everything from where to put the ''buy'' button on its Web pages to how to adjust its shipping systems in case of a snowstorm over Chicago. Now Amazon has turned its quantitative prowess on one of the most vexing questions in marketing: Is television advertising worth the expense? Amazon's answer is no. And it has canceled plans for any television or general-purpose print advertising this year. The company is so sure of its decision that it has dismantled its five-member advertising department, assigning the employees to other roles.
2003-01-24	Amazon Beats Expectations Of Analysts In 4th Quarter	In one of the toughest retail markets in years, sales at Amazon.com increased 28 percent, to $1.43 billion, in the fourth quarter of last year. And the online store, which had lost money in the first three quarters of 2002, posted a quarterly profit of $2.7 million. Amazon's profits, excluding some accounting charges, substantially exceeded analysts' expectations, even as its sales growth accelerated. A year ago, Amazon had slowed its growth to focus on increasing its efficiency and stemming its losses.

2003-01-16	For SAC's Wizard, Uncomfortable Attention	Steven A. Cohen may be the most successful -- and wealthiest -- hedge fund manager that no one outside Wall Street knows. But the disclosure yesterday that a stock trader at SAC Capital Advisors, Mr. Cohen's fund, is being investigated by securities regulators for possible insider trading may put Mr. Cohen and SAC under a spotlight that by all accounts he would rather avoid.
2003-01-15	Wall St. Analyst and Husband Under Scrutiny	Holly B. Becker, one of Wall Street's most powerful Internet stock analysts, and her husband have been notified by securities regulators that they may face enforcement action over possible insider trading based on her firm's research. The regulatory inquiry, which began almost two years ago, centers on whether information from Ms. Becker's firm, Lehman Brothers, was made available to her husband, Michael J. Zimmerman, a stock trader at SAC Capital Advisors, a hedge fund with offices in Connecticut and New York, according to people involved in the inquiry. Investigators are trying to determine whether he knew about research reports by Lehman analysts before they were released to clients and whether he profited by trading in those securities.
2002-12-29	Coming Up Roses In a Downcast Year	THE year 2002 will surely go down as one of the worst in business history. Scandal rocked corporate suites and Washington offices, jobs evaporated, the American economy muddled along and Europe and Latin America reeled. Rogues at companies like WorldCom and Enron were bad enough, but even superstar executives like Jack Welch contributed to the staining of corporate America.
2002-12-14	A Retailing Mix: On Internet, in Print and in Store	In 1999, as online sales were beginning to take off, Lands' End decided that it could mail fewer catalogs and encourage customers to shop on the Internet. Sales lagged, and by the next year it was mailing as many catalogs as ever. By this year, the Internet will represent 30 percent of Lands' End's holiday sales, up from 25 percent last year. And the company, now owned by Sears, Roebuck, is still going to mail 270 million catalogs. Many customers, it turns out, buy from each at different times and for different reasons.
2002-11-26	Bertelsmann to Let Amazon.com Run CDNow	CDNow, the pioneering online music store that is now owned by Bertelsmann, has agreed to cede much of its operation to Amazon.com. Amazon will operate CDNow's Web site and it will ship most of the merchandise from Amazon warehouses, according to executives close to both companies. Amazon already runs the online stores for two other onetime rivals, Borders.com and VirginMega.com. Typically, Amazon pays a percentage of the sales price to companies for which it operates stores, but the details of the CDNow deal were not disclosed.
2002-11-18	Compressed Data; The Gap Appears on Amazon, but Without Reviews	With great fanfare, Amazon.com introduced its apparel department a few weeks ago. For the first time, consumers could use Amazon's shopping tools, like customer reviews, at dozens of retailers, like the Gap. Except there are no reviews, it turns out, of Gap product.
2002-11-08	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Loudeye And Amazon Reach Deal On Music Samples	The Loudeye Corporation, a company based in Seattle that develops Webcasting technology, announced an agreement with Amazon.com yesterday to provide music samples on Amazon's popular retail site. Loudeye replaces Muze, which had previously provided music samples for Amazon. Loudeye says that it now provides music samples for a majority of online retail music sites and that last year it served more than 620 million samples. The company has deals with all five major recording companies and offers music samples from over 250,000 CD's. Last week, the company reported revenue of $3.6 million for the third quarter, a 45 percent increase over the period last year. It also trimmed its net loss to $4.1 million, compared with a $12 million loss in the quarter a year earlier. Shares in the company jumped on news of the Amazon.com agreement, gaining 12 cents, to 49 cents. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
2002-11-01	Amazon.com Previews a New Apparel Site, Snags and All	Amazon.com switched on a preview of its widely anticipated apparel department yesterday, announcing it in an e-mail message to many of its best customers. The site included clothing and footwear from 400 retailers and manufacturers including Gap, Nordstrom, Eddie Bauer, Foot Locker, Guess and Phillips-Van Heusen. The apparel department was available to anyone through the Internet site, www.amazon.com/ruby.
2002-10-25	Amazon's Loss in Quarter Shows a Sharp Decrease	With sales buoyed by its offer of free shipping, Amazon.com announced yesterday that it had sharply decreased its loss in the third quarter. Amazon lost $35 million, compared with a loss of $170 million a year ago. The company posted sales of $851 million, up 33 percent from a year ago. Last year, however, the company estimated that it had lost $25 million to $35 million as a result of disruptions after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
2002-09-27	New Software Quietly Diverts Sales Commissions	Some popular online services are using a new kind of software to divert sales commissions that would otherwise be paid to small online merchants by big sites like Amazon and eToys. Critics call the software parasite-ware and stealware. But the sites that use the software, which is made by nearly 20 companies and used by dozens, say that it is perfectly legal, because their users agree to the diversion.
2002-09-03	Bertelsmann Snips Away On the Internet	A month after it dismissed its technology-minded chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff, the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann is harshly pruning his Internet ventures. Bertelsmann plans to shut down or sell BOL.com, its main online book-selling service, and has held exploratory talks with its chief rival, Amazon.com, people close to the deliberations said today.
2002-08-27	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Amazon Changes Shipping Plan	Amazon.com yesterday cut by half the amount shoppers must spend to have merchandise shipped free as the company, the world's largest Internet retailer, seeks to lift sales and gain new customers. Shoppers who buy $25 or more of certain products can get free shipping under a test program, Amazon.com said in a statement. In June, Amazon reduced the minimum purchase required for free shipping to $49 from $99. The lowering of shipping costs is an attempt to turn browsers into buyers and persuade existing customers to order more, the company said. Amazon also expanded discounts in April, offering a 30 percent price reduction on any book with a publisher's list price of more than $15. It previously offered the discount on books of more than $20. ''It's probably a sign that they're having a good quarter,'' said Darren Chervitz, research director for Jacob Asset Management in New York. Customers who select free shipping must accept delivery schedules as much as five days longer than Amazon.com's regular services. Shares of Amazon fell 24 cents, to $14.93.
2002-08-14	Companies Certify Data Today; Some Seem Quite Confused	Top executives at nearly half the companies required to do so have certified their financial statements ahead of today's deadline. But many companies remained confused last night about their responsibilities and potential penalties. Most companies are expected to file the statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have been reviewing their figures and consulting with their lawyers for weeks. After such a review, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced a modest earnings restatement yesterday.
2002-08-13	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Target To Use Amazon Retail Services	The Target Corporation and Amazon.com deepened what was already a close online relationship yesterday when they announced that Target's three store chains -- Mervyn's, Marshall Field's and Target -- were now using Amazon's online retail services. Mervyn's and Marshall Field's online customers are redirected to the Target.com site. Once there, customers may buy merchandise from each of the stores within the Target chain and may also purchase books, music and videos from Amazon. While Target continues to handle shipping and warehousing for Mervyn's and Marshall Field's online orders, Amazon operates the site on behalf of all the stores, using technology similar to that offered on Amazon.com. Amazon executes all shipping and handling for products from the Target brand store. The specific terms of the deal, which was initially announced in September and is now going into effect, were not disclosed, but Amazon will earn sales commissions and a flat annual fee. Amazon has had a Target store within the Amazon.com Web site since October. Bob Tedeschi (NYT)
2002-08-01	THE MARKETS: Market Place; G.E. Joining Move Toward New Way To Count Options	General Electric, the nation's biggest company by stock market value, yesterday joined a small but growing group of companies that are changing how they account for stock options. G.E. went even further by saying that top executives would no longer be allowed to take profits immediately after cashing in options. Responding to criticism that options-heavy pay packages have given executives enormous incentives to create short-term profits, G.E. said it would require its top officers to hold, for at least a year, some of the shares they get after exercising options. It also said those officers would have to hold substantial stock positions as long as they work at the company.
2002-07-24	Citing Its Price Strategy, Amazon Pares Loss	Amazon.com posted slightly better-than-expected financial results yesterday, as its operations continued to stabilize. Amazon, the largest online retailer, lost $94 million in the second quarter, compared with a loss of $168 million a year earlier. The company, whose sales stagnated last year, increased revenue by 21 percent, to $806 million, a little more than expected. It attributed the increase to its price-cutting strategy -- discounting books that cost more than $15 and offering free shipping on orders of at least $49.
2002-07-22	E-Commerce Report; The 25 top e-tailers, and the various approaches they use -- from catalogs to hand-holding -- to increase their sales.	THE Internet research firm comScore Networks plans to release its list of the 25 highest-selling Web retailers for May today, and the usual suspects figure prominently. Dell.com ranks first, with almost double the sales of Ticketmaster and Amazon, which rank second and third. Office Depot, Sears and Victoria's Secret also rank high.
2002-07-01	E-Commerce Report; Amazon is said to be shopping for partners to offer more apparel on its Web site.	AMAZON is getting some new clothes. The company, which has held the line on product expansion for the last nine months, will open an online apparel store this summer or in early fall, in time to fix any problems before the holiday shopping season begins, according to retail industry executives who have been approached by Amazon.
2002-06-25	Technology Briefing | E-Commerce: Amazon To Work With Virgin Entertainment	The Virgin Entertainment Group said yesterday that it would give Amazon.com day-to-day control of its e-commerce operation. Users who type in the address of Virgin's Web site are now taken to an Amazon site, where they can buy the same range of music, videos and books available on Amazon's main site, but with entertainment news, gossip and other information from Virgin's staff. Virgin will receive an undisclosed commission on each sale. Bob Tedeschi (NYT)
2002-06-12	Menus at Hand, at a Turn of the Web Page	Since its inception, Amazon.com has helped with dinner, with cookbooks, then cookware. Now it has a new service: menus from thousands of restaurants in New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington are on the Web site. The menus are cross-referenced by neighborhood, cuisine or even a particular dish. Prices, addresses, telephone numbers are given, and driving directions can be obtained. There is no charge to the consumer or the restaurant. Carrie Peters, a spokeswoman for Amazon, stressed that the service was an experiment. Indeed, the listings have not been fine-tuned: some menus are not given, some are outdated and some restaurants have closed. The restaurants whose menus appear were not consulted. ''I don't know how it happened but I don't think it can hurt,'' said Danny Meyer, an owner of Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern, two New York restaurants that are featured. Ms. Peters said restaurants could have their menus removed if they wished. The site (click on ''Restaurants'' under the Service heading of Amazon.com) also has a list of the most popular restaurants in each city, based Zagat-style on consumer response.
2002-06-11	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Amazon is told not to help anyone fake results ever again.	THE good news for Amazon.com is that the Securities and Exchange Commission did not charge it with faking its own books in connection with its Amazon Commerce Network, an alliance of other Internet sites in which Amazon both invested and received advertising revenue. The bad news is that the S.E.C. concluded that Amazon did help one of those companies falsify its books. The result yesterday was that Amazon.com accepted a cease-and-desist order from the S.E.C., ordering it not to help anyone else violate securities laws. As penalties go for violating securities laws, it was one of the lesser ones, but it was a violation nonetheless.
2002-05-20	MediaTalk; Try This Obscure Book, Not That Best Seller	Like many little-known authors, Janis Jaquith often wishes that some of the people buying best sellers would pick up her book instead. Now the online retailer Amazon.com is giving her a chance to express those feelings. Two weeks ago, Amazon's Web site added a feature that lets users suggest that shoppers buy a different book than the one being perused, and Ms. Jaquith, the self-published author of the memoir ''Birdseed Cookies,'' has taken full advantage.
2002-05-19	Amazon II: Will This Smile Last?	JEFF BEZOS is feeling a tad cocky lately. That might seem like a dog-bites-man observation for the founder of Amazon.com, a man so obsessed with brain power that he started a science-and-literature summer school for children after his freshman year at Princeton and once hired only college graduates to staff the customer-service phone lines at his company. Still, it's been a rough turn of the millennium for Mr. Bezos, now 38. At the peak of the Internet mania in 1999, Amazon's stock soared above $100 and he was Time magazine's Man of the Year, lionized for guaranteeing ''that the world of buying and selling will never be the same.''
2002-05-16	Book Bargains to Warm a Mommy's Heart	THE reason I dislike the word ''mommy,'' I told the dog, is because that whiny second syllable robs ''mom'' of its dignity. The reason I was discussing this with the dog the other day was that he was crouched under the kitchen table, watching closely as I scraped gum from a chair leg. The wad still smelled faintly grape. Plus there was the bombshell of discovering a Barbie under there, her hair glitter-glued to the floor.
2002-04-29	E-Commerce Report; The success of eBay is spawning a number of online liquidation houses.	THE short history of the Internet is littered with companies that tried to act as incubators for new online businesses, nearly all of which failed. But there is one de facto incubator still helping to spawn new online companies: its name is eBay. Since its founding nearly seven years ago, eBay has given impetus to e-payment services, online escrow businesses and countless small companies set up to sell goods that might never have found a market without eBay.
2002-04-24	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Amazon Defies The Naysayers As Losses Drop And Sales Grow	Challenging skeptics who said that its business had stagnated, Amazon.com said today that sales in the first quarter had grown faster than expected and that its loss was less than expected. Amazon, the biggest online retailer, said its sales were $847 million, up 21 percent. At the same time, the company lost $23 million, down from a loss of $217 million a year ago, when Amazon took a $114 million charge to cover the cost of closing two warehouses and an additional $49 million charge to write off some investments.
2002-04-23	Used Books on the Web	To the Editor: Sylvia Nasar (''Readers as Salesmen,'' Op-Ed, April 17) overlooks book marketing realities.
2002-04-17	Readers as Salesmen	Last week I got an e-mail message from the Authors Guild urging me to join its protest of Amazon.com's ''notorious used-book service.'' Amazon has lately been encouraging customers -- with offers on the same Web pages that promote new releases -- to resell recently purchased books and buy recycled ones. You'd think I would be up in arms. The other day Amazon was selling used copies of the hardcover edition of my book for $15 (list price is $26), and neither Simon & Schuster, my publisher, nor I will collect a nickel. That money will go to the reseller, minus Amazon's 99-cent fee and its 15 percent commission. Surely, as the guild claims, new book sales and royalties will suffer. Or will they? I drive a used car, live in a ''used'' house and own a lot of used economics books. As far as I know, purveyors of new cars, houses and textbooks are doing fine. Might Amazon's latest innovation be good for everyone, including authors?
2002-04-13	Selling Used Books Online: Be Fair to Writers	To the Editor: The dispute between Amazon.com and the Authors Guild about online sales of used books (Business Day, April 10) could undercut the greatest invention for finding used books that ever existed: the search capacity of the online seller. Many of us agree that where a painting or book continues to generate revenue by being sold and resold, the artist should receive something from that revenue stream. Unfortunately, no practical way has yet been found to do that for most resales of art. But with online sales of used books, why couldn't we just tack a buck onto the price of each book and distribute the money through some scheme devised by the Authors Guild?
2002-04-12	ON STAGE AND OFF	Slapstick Is Their Shtick Two major names, Mike Nichols and Kenneth Branagh, are coming to Broadway next year in behind-the-scenes capacities for a play about a famed comedy team that most Americans have never heard of. The show is ''The Play What I Wrote,'' a runaway hit in the West End of London starring Hamish McColl and Sean Foley as none other than Morecambe and Wise.
2002-04-11	Unloading His Books, But Not His Conscience	A FEW weeks ago a friend carried a pile of dusty volumes to the Strand, the used-book store in Greenwich Village, to trade clutter for cash. ''I would never do that,'' I thought snootily, as I pictured him haggling over the value of a dog-eared copy of ''The Internet for Dummies.'' And then I logged on to Amazon.com to buy a book and was startled to see: ''Fred A. Bernstein, make $436.32. Sell your past purchases at Amazon.com today!'' In an audacious gambit to expand its marketplace, Amazon has not only become a broker of used books but has also found a way to prime the pump: encouraging people who bought books on Amazon to resell them.
2002-04-10	Online Sales Of Used Books Draw Protest	Authors are rebelling against new efforts by Amazon.com to spur sales of used books, a practice that has become a major source of revenue for Amazon but pays nothing to writers or publishers. The Authors Guild, a trade group for writers, yesterday sent an e-mail message to its 8,200 members, advising them to stop helping Amazon sell books by linking to it from their own Web sites, citing Amazon's ''notorious used-book service.''
2002-04-08	E-Commerce Report; The three big Internet portals begin to distinguish among themselves as shopping malls.	YAHOO and MSN have worked hard at catching up to America Online in recent years, at least as far as their online shopping malls go. The three portals now feature many of the same marquee retailers, offering the same merchandise, frequently at the same prices. Not surprisingly, they attract the same types of people -- in their mid-40's, with household incomes around $65,000 and annual online spending of about $450. So why would so many retailers continue to throw advertising money at all three?
2002-03-06	Technology Briefing | Internet: Executive Leaving	Amazon.com, the Internet retailer, said its chief financial officer, Warren Jenson, plans to resign later this year. Mr. Jenson has been Amazon.com's top financial officer since September 1999, when he left the same job at Delta Air Lines. He will stay on for several months to recruit a successor.
2002-01-26	A Profitable Amazon Looks to Do an Encore	So Amazon.com Inc. actually turned a profit. Skeptics thought it never would and even fans assumed that the company would take another couple of years before its ink ran black. Has Amazon learned enough from its achievement so far to ensure its success?
2002-01-23	A Surprise From Amazon: Its First Profit	After losing $2.8 billion since it was founded in 1995, the online retailer Amazon.com said yesterday that it had made its first quarterly profit, $5 million, validating at least in part its strategy to grow rapidly first and worry about profits later. Amazon's financial results were far better than expected because a yearlong efficiency drive sharply cut costs even as sales grew. An accounting gain related to the decline of the euro's value provided a final push. So the company was able to show a profit by the conventional standard, rather than merely by the nonstandard ''pro forma'' measures that it and other Internet companies prefer.
2002-01-22	Corrections	A picture caption in Business Day yesterday about Amazon.com's shipping methods misstated the job of Carrie Peters, shown at a computer keyboard in a warehouse. She is a public relations official, not what the company calls a flowmeister, an employee who directs warehouse operations.
2002-01-21	Amazon Ships to a Sorting Machine's Beat	Ever since it built five vast warehouses in 1999, Amazon.com has boasted of the wonders of the machinery inside them -- 10 miles of conveyer belts and myriad other gadgets. What Amazon was not so vocal about was how many people it took to operate those machines, especially during the holiday rush. In 2000, for example, Amazon had to hire 7,200 temporary workers to supplement the 4,400 people working in its warehouses in the United States.
2002-01-14	Compressed Data; Site Compiles an Amazon Best-Seller List	Philip J. Kaplan's intended road to success is a familiar path from the dot-com boom: develop software code to solve a personal need, post it on a Web site and start generating income. Mr. Kaplan, of Manhattan, operates Amazonscan.com, a new Web site that grabs sales-ranking data from Amazon.com and displays the information as an enormous best-seller list of titles. Mr. Kaplan developed the program to track preorders for his own book, a look at failed Internet companies. The book, which will be published in April by Simon & Schuster, is based on his popular Web site that irreverently tracked the demise of failing dot-coms. (The site's name, in vulgar slang, translates as ''doomed company.'')
2002-01-06	Business; Still Alive and Growing Online, Without Fanfare	THE court-ordered auction of the assets of Webvan was something of a spectator sport, Silicon Valley style. Dozens of former employees, reporters, television crews and gawkers, many of them unemployed technology workers, gathered in late October at the company's shuttered headquarters near San Francisco for a sell-off of computer and office equipment. It was as much a chance to witness the final chapter in one of the most spectacular failures of the Internet bubble as to gaze at piles of some of the most sophisticated technology gear anywhere.
2001-12-31	Players Left Standing Now Seek Viability	A milestone of sorts was reached last week when Yahoo succeeded with a hostile offer to buy HotJobs.com, an online recruiting site. For most of the last year, you could not give Internet companies away, and the prospect of a bidding war over any of them was unheard of. Now the field of Internet companies has thinned to just the real problem cases and a few that may actually be worth something. Webmergers, a research firm, counted 537 Internet companies that closed in 2001, nearly twice as many as in 2000.
2001-11-02	NBC and Amazon Aim Store at Viewers	NBC Connect in New York, the division of NBC sales and marketing that develops multimedia advertising packages, and Amazon.com, based in Seattle, have agreed to create an online store that will enable viewers of programs on NBC broadcast and cable networks and stations to buy merchandise mentioned in or related to those programs. The store will operate through Dec. 30. Though terms were not disclosed, NBC will receive part of the revenue from sales generated by the store.
2001-10-29	Compressed Data; Amazon Removes a Startling Book Jacket	An e-mail message circulating on the Internet last week gave recipients a jolt when they clicked on the Web link in the text of the message, which took them to a book for sale on Amazon.com's British site. The book jacket bore Arabic script, the face of a Saudi prince in traditional attire and the image of a plane flying through the top of a skyscraper.
2001-10-28	The Way We Live Now: 10-28-01: The ethicist; Up the Amazon	Recently some people objected to Amazon.com's giving sales commissions to Intifada.com. Amazon relented, canceling this arrangement, while preserving similar deals with more than 50,000 Web sites.While I abhor the Intifada, I worry about encouraging companies to choose business relationships contingent on politics. Is it censorship or just good business? M. D., Washington It's certainly not censorship. Amazon.com does not refuse to sell particular books. It does not seek to deprive a purveyor of unpopular ideas of the ability to make a living, as the blacklists of the McCarthy era did. Indeed, Amazon's refusal to associate with those whose ideas it finds repugnant is itself a form of expression. One can honorably choose not to go into business with LetsBeReallyMeanToCutePuppies.com.
2001-10-24	Amazon Had Smaller Loss On Flat Sales In 3rd Quarter	Losses at Amazon.com narrowed as much as analysts expected in the third quarter, but its sales fell short of expectations. The company also said yesterday that its sales in the fourth quarter would be sharply below its earlier forecasts. The company said it was aggressively cutting costs and still hoped to make an operating profit in the fourth quarter -- at least by its preferred pro forma profit measure.
2001-10-10	Technology Briefing | Internet: Amazon Bolsters Images	You still cannot sip a double espresso while you shop, but Amazon.com is trying to make it easier to browse through its book catalog. Today, users will be able to view a selection of images from 25,000 of its top-selling books, including the cover flaps, tables of contents, indexes and some sample pages. For years, Amazon and Barnesandnoble.com, its main rival, have included chapters of some books in text form. And Barnesandnoble has a handful of images from art books. But Amazon will now have more pages from more books as graphic images. For now, Amazon will not charge publishers to display pages from their books, said Jason Kailar, its vice president for book, music and video sales. Amazon's motive, he said, was not the revenue from publishers but increasing the number of browsers who become buyers. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2001-09-27	Technology Briefing | Internet: Amazon Starts A Travel Venture	Getting into what, until two weeks ago, was the hottest area of the Internet, Amazon.com introduced a department where its shoppers can book travel and buy travel-related merchandise. Mainly, the section includes links to reservations from Expedia.com, the big travel site controlled by Microsoft. It also has links to Hotwire.com, which offers heavily restricted discount tickets, and tour packages from the National Leisure Group. Amazon was set to unveil the section two weeks ago, but put off its debut in the aftermath of the terrorist attack and subsequent falloff in travel. Analysts said Expedia will pay Amazon some fees in return for sending it customers, but the effect on both companies' financial results is expected to be modest. Amazon shares fell 74 cents, or 10.4 percent, to $6.35. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2001-08-30	Amazon Starts A Storefront For Computers	FALLING prices and dusty inventory haven't deterred a familiar retailer from jumping into the computer hardware business. Amazon.com, the Internet bookstore that grew into an Internet superstore, opened its online computer storefront yesterday at www .amazon.com/computers. It offers new computers from Apple, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Toshiba, and refurbished computers from resellers like Essex Technology Group, TechSmart and Overstock.com. Although Amazon is the authorized dealer for all the new computers it will sell, orders will be filled and delivered by the technology wholesaler Ingram Micro U.S.
2001-08-27	Compressed Data; Who's Composing All Those Fake Online Reviews?	Is it the phantom of Amazon.com? Amazon, the giant online bookselling site, features reviews written by readers, and jokers learned long ago that they could post fake reviews on the site under pseudonyms. A series of book reviews on Amazon.com -- supposedly written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the creator of Broadway spectacles like ''Evita,'' ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' ''Phantom of the Opera'' and ''Cats'' -- brought the practice to comic highs and low blows last week.
2001-08-22	Suits Dismissed Against Morgan Stanley	A federal judge dismissed shareholder lawsuits against Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and the analyst Mary Meeker, saying the complaints were ''an entangled mass of verbiage'' filled with ''market gossip.'' The lawsuits, filed Aug. 1 in Manhattan federal court by investors in the Internet auctioneer Ebay and the retailer Amazon.com, accused Ms. Meeker of offering biased research and slanted investment advice about the Internet companies to secure lucrative banking business for Morgan Stanley, the No. 2 retail brokerage company after Merrill Lynch.
2001-08-21	Amazon.com to Sell Products From Circuit City	Circuit City Group, the nation's second-biggest consumer-electronics retailer, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its products online through Amazon.com Inc., the largest Internet retailer. Customers will be able to buy electronic products from Circuit City through Amazon starting in November and pick up the items at local stores. Products offered by Amazon that are not available in Circuit City stores can be delivered.
2001-08-15	Efforts to Ease Worries On New Net Addresses	The two companies responsible for introducing new extensions for the Internet's address system are taking steps to address concerns about the processes for distributing the new addresses, .info and .biz. In response to criticism that an advance-registration period for .info addresses left loopholes allowing individuals to register trademarked names fraudulently, the consortium that manages .info, Afilias, plans to announce today that it will challenge attempts by nontrademark holders to register those names.
2001-08-03	Morgan Stanley and Analyst Sued Over Advice	Two lawsuits filed yesterday in federal district court accused Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company and one of its analysts, Mary Meeker, of defrauding investors in the Internet auctioneer eBay Inc. and the online retailer Amazon.com. In the lawsuits, investors asserted that Ms. Meeker offered biased research and slanted investment advice about eBay and Amazon.com as a way to secure banking business for Morgan Stanley, the No. 2 retail brokerage firm after Merrill Lynch.
2001-07-31	Technology Briefing | Internet: Online Toy Store Is Started	Amazon.com and Toys ''R'' Us announced yesterday that they had begun Imaginarium.com, an online store for specialty and educational toys. The site is the third online effort the two companies have taken on together, after the introductions of Toysrus.com last fall and Babiesrus.com earlier this year. The two companies first allied in August 2000, when Amazon took over fulfillment for Toysrus.com. Imaginarium, which once had 41 stores in 13 states, was purchased by Toys ''R'' Us in January of 1999. The online toy market has proved tricky for some companies like eToys, a well-financed Internet toy retailer which declared bankruptcy earlier this year. Still, Amazon and Toys ''R'' Us are betting that specialty toys are more likely to be a winner online. The companies say they will offer one of the Internet's best specialty selections of learning toys and will allow parents to search for toys according to the specific skills they would like their child to develop.

2001-07-25	IN AMAZON'S STOCK SALE TO AOL, A CLAUSE ABOUT TAKEOVER	Amazon.com, in agreeing to sell $100 million of stock to America Online, included a provision that lets AOL propose a takeover of the company, the world's largest Internet retailer. The contract, filed with the S.E.C., includes provisions that bar AOL, a unit of AOL Time Warner, from increasing its stake in Amazon.com or seeking board control. Such ''standstill'' provisions are often included in investment agreements. Less common was a caveat to the standstill restrictions that permits AOL to suggest an ''extraordinary transaction'' with Amazon.com, as long as the talks can be kept confidential.
2001-07-16	Compressed Data; Amazon's Chief Agrees To Play Barbecue Chef	So why is Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, throwing a barbecue today in New York for Modern Humorist, a tiny Brooklyn publishing company and Web site operator? After all, the first time Amazon ran into the band of Harvard Lampoon alumni who produce Modern Humorist was when they had to remove the Wish List they had posted on Amazon on behalf of George W. Bush. The president, as it turned out, had not really requested that anyone buy him a Fantastic Four comic book, or the volume, ''Pronounce It Perfectly in English.''
2001-06-27	Technology Briefing | Internet: Congress Seeks Information On Fraud	Members of Congress yesterday asked for guidance from some of the companies that are hosts to Internet auctions -- Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com -- in assessing the prevalence of online auction fraud. Representatives Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, left, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Heather A. Wilson, Republican of New Mexico, sent letters to the chief executives of the companies in an effort to learn more about how the fraud occurs and ways to stop it. The lawmakers cited findings from a recent study by the Internet Fraud Complaint Center that showed online auction fraud accounted for about 64 percent of all fraud complaints received by the center from May to November 2000. Company officials were asked what types of fraud occurred in online auctions, what rules existed for dealing with disguised identities and if these rules might actually aid fraudulent practices, and whether certain state laws or regulations interfered with the ability to combat online fraud.
2001-06-18	MediaTalk; Amazon's Chairman Tries the Literary Life	Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder and chairman of Amazon.com, made his debut as a literary critic last week, displaying both his taste in reading and, to those watching closely, a certain gratitude. On June 10, Mr. Bezos signed on to Amazon.com to write a customer review of ''The Proving Ground,'' the new book by G. Bruce Knecht, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. ''Intense and disciplined,'' Mr. Bezos wrote of the book, which narrates a 1998 yacht race caught in a storm that sank several boats and killed many crew members.
2001-06-13	If You Like This Story, Click Here to Pay Me	THE financing dried up, Web advertising was not generating enough money, and there were no potential investors in sight. So I did what all good Americans should do in time of need: I begged. Almost anybody with a Web site can do the same. Just go to Amazon.com and sign up for its Honor System, which allows visitors to donate money to participating Web sites with their credit cards. Since the service started in February, several thousand sites have signed up to receive money, according to Jonathan Leblang, the director of the Honor System at Amazon.
2001-06-10	Private Sector; From the Dad Who Has Everything	Stumped for a present for Dad on his special day, a week away? Amazon.com suggests the wit and wisdom of Warren E. Buffett, the multibillionaire investor, in the form of a 60-minute videocassette titled ''Oracle of Omaha,'' featuring interviews with Mr. Buffett, his three children, Buffett experts and footage from the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Corporation at which he rambles on for most of a day -- to the delight of shareholders -- about his business philosophy.
2001-06-06	Amazon.com Is Planning to Sell PC's for First Time	Amazon.com, in its first major product line expansion this year, said yesterday that it intended to start selling personal computers in the next few months. Amazon's electronics department already sells computer add-ons like disk drives and memory. Amazon discussed its computer business as part of a full-day presentation to investors in Seattle, where it has its headquarters. The company, the money-losing online retailer, also reiterated its intention to be profitable, on an operating basis, in the fourth quarter of this year. And it said for the first time that it expected to be profitable for the full year of 2002.
2001-05-31	Recent account maneuvers involve big household names like Amazon, Energizer and others.	IT MAY be a short workweek, but there was enough account news yesterday on Madison Avenue for a long week, even two weeks, involving big advertisers with familiar brands like Amazon, Energizer, Dial, Visa and The Wall Street Journal. Amazon.com, the online retailer, is consolidating its worldwide advertising, with billings estimated at $50 million, and naming Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., to handle the assignment. The decision came after a review that lasted nearly six months and had been narrowed to Wieden & Kennedy and one other finalist, Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Bcom3 Group.
2001-05-27	Corrections	An article last Sunday about Amazon.com's efforts to become profitable misidentified the Tennessee town that is headquarters to the Ingram Book Group, a distributor hired by the company to mail books directly to customers. It is La Vergne, not Laverne. The article also misstated the reason an Amazon.com office building in Seattle is named ''US1.'' The name stands for Union Station 1, part of an office complex. It is not Amazon's abbreviation for the building that houses the company's United States sales operations.
2001-05-20	Listen Up! It's Time for a Profit; A Front-Row Seat as Amazon Gets Serious	IT is an unusually sunny day for Seattle, but no one can tell in the narrow, windowless conference room where Russell Allgor is drawing graphs on a white board. Dr. Allgor earned his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developing quantitative methods for making chemical plants more productive. Last summer, he moved from Bayer Chemical to Amazon.com and has built an 800,000-equation computer model of the company's sprawling operation, meant to help do most everything from scheduling Christmas overtime to rerouting trucks in a snowstorm. Dr. Allgor's work is part of a major shift in direction for Amazon.com, the online retailing giant. Its watchwords have changed from the buoyant ''get big fast'' to the pedestrian ''march to profitability.'' And instead of designing zippy new features for its Web site and plotting new industries to conquer, its employees are turning to the tedious work of ordinary companies: cutting costs and raising revenue.
2001-05-09	Chief to Regularly Sell Amazon Shares	Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer Amazon.com Inc., has adopted a plan committing him to selling company stock at fixed intervals, a move that might shield him from future questions about insider trading. The new stock plan, reported in a regulatory filing, follows the disclosure that the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information on sales of Amazon.com shares by Mr. Bezos in February.
2001-04-28	Amazon Unit Settles Suit	The Alexa software division of Amazon.com Inc., which was named last year in class-action lawsuits accusing it of fraud and violations of privacy, said today that it would remove personal information from its database and pay some individuals $40 each to settle the case. It did not admit any wrongdoing.
2001-04-26	AMAZON CONFIRMS S.E.C. QUERY	Amazon.com confirmed yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had recently requested information about stock sales by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company's chairman, in early February just before a Wall Street firm released a negative research report on the company. Bill Curry, the Amazon spokesman, said there was ''no cause for any action'' from the S.E.C., but the company would comply with requests. In documents filed on Feb. 2 and Feb. 5, Mr. Bezos said he intended to sell 800,000 Amazon shares worth about $12.2 million. A week earlier, Amazon executives had received an advance copy of research by Lehman Brothers. The S.E.C. declined to comment.
2001-04-25	Amazon Pares Quarter Loss As It Increases Some Sales	Amazon.com reported a lower-than-expected loss yesterday, surprising Wall Street as it pushed costs down in its drive to become profitable by the end of the year. The company lost $234.13 million in the first quarter, down from a loss of $308.43 million a year earlier. Its sales increased 22 percent, to $700.36 million, though most of the increase came in electronics and international operations.
2001-04-19	When Familiarity Breeds Temptation	I PRIDE myself on being tenacious when it comes to shopping for food. The time I heard that a fish market two towns away had the tiny clams I needed for a sauce, I did not hesitate. And I once drove for 20 minutes to check out a rumored shipment of collard greens. So I was embarrassed to admit to my friend Jean the other day that I had never visited the fancy new supermarket that opened less than a mile from my house more than a year ago.
2001-04-18	Online Seller's Book Business Is Up in Quarter	The online retailer Barnesandnoble.com said yesterday that it expected to report that its first-quarter sales rose 23 percent from the period a year earlier, suggesting that it is gaining market share on its much larger competitor, Amazon.com. ''It is surprising,'' said Mark Rowen, an Internet analyst at Prudential Securities, noting that Barnesandnoble.com had not appeared to gain market share in the previous quarter.
2001-04-17	NO RAISE FOR AMAZON CHIEF, AGAIN	Jeff Bezos, left, the chief executive of Amazon.com, did not receive a raise last year, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Bezos was paid $81,840 in 2000, the same salary as the previous two years. Other Amazon executives did quite a bit better, led by Warren C. Jenson, the chief financial officer, who received $2.1 million in total compensation, including a raise to $177,450 from $55,679. Jeffrey A. Wilke, vice president for operations, was paid $1.3 million and Mark J. Britto, vice president for cross-site merchandising, received $1.1 million. Despite the steep drop in price of Amazon stock, Mr. Bezos's 32 percent stake is still worth $1.7 billion. Andrew Zipern
2001-04-16	Sales Growth In Books Online Is Leveling Off	After five years of astonishing growth, the heyday of online book sales has apparently ended, and some book publishers are already beginning to miss it. Last Monday, Amazon.com, which dominates the market for online books with four times the sales of its nearest competitor, said that its online books, music and videos business would post ''very slight sales growth'' in the first quarter from the comparable period last year. That represented an abrupt drop for Amazon, whose sales of those products had more than doubled annually for several years and had risen about 30 percent in 2000.
2001-04-12	BORDERS CONFIRMS AMAZON DEAL	The Borders Group confirmed yesterday that it would close its money-losing online bookstore and that Amazon.com would operate a store on its behalf. Starting in August, customers going to the Borders.com will see a customized version of Amazon's Web store that will also have the Borders name. The merchandise, book reviews and prices will all be Amazon's. The site will have some information from Borders, including the locations of its stores and a list of coming events. Borders will pay Amazon a fee to set up the site and will receive a commission from Amazon on any sales that the site generates. The companies declined to specify exact terms of the arrangement, but people close to the situation said that Amazon's payments to Borders would be similar to the standard 5 percent commission it pays to affiliates, as it calls Web sites that refer it customers. Customers will generally not pay sales tax and will not be able to return books to Borders stores. The arrangement does not require Borders to promote the Borders-Amazon Web site. Saul Hansell
2001-04-11	Borders Is Said To Be Quitting Online Effort To Sell Books	The Borders Group, the nation's second-largest bookseller, is closing its struggling online store and will have Amazon.com serve its customers instead, executives involved in the plans said yesterday. Last night, Amazon scheduled a news conference for today in New York with Jeff Bezos, its founder and chief executive, but it did not give the topic. Spokeswomen for Amazon and Borders declined to comment.
2001-04-10	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Amazon's Loss Will Be Lower Than Expected	Amazon.com, the online retailer, surprised Wall Street yesterday by saying that it would report a smaller loss than it had forecast in the quarter just ended despite little if any growth in its primary business of selling books in this country. ''In my opinion, operationally, this is the best quarter in our history,'' said Warren Jenson, Amazon's chief financial officer, in a brief conference call.
2001-04-06	BIBLIOFIND HEADED FOR AMAZON FOLD	Bibliofind, an online service for finding used, rare and out-of-print books, said that after May 7 visitors to its Web site would be transferred to Amazon.com. Bibliofind was acquired by Amazon in April 1999 but has continued to operate independently. Last month, Bibliofind took part of its service offline after disclosing a four-month hackers' spree that left 98,000 user names, addresses and credit card numbers exposed. In a letter to customers, the company said that it would not transfer any personal information to Amazon.com. Last month Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chairman of Amazon, above, said that Amazon would have its first operating profit by year-end. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
2001-03-27	AMAZON CHIEF STICKS BY FORECAST	Amazon.com's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, reaffirmed estimates that the company would have its first operating profit by year-end. Appearing yesterday on CNBC, Mr. Bezos cautioned that profitability was ''not a guarantee.'' He said that while Amazon had $650 million in cash, his company would not need to raise additional cash unless for ''strategic reasons.'' The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Amazon was in talks with Best Buy about a possible alliance. Andrew Zipern
2001-03-23	Treasures From the Vault	Jump onto Amazon.com's video store and call up ''Hanna's War'' (1988), based on the diaries of Hanna Senesh (Maruschka Detmers), a young Hungarian Jew executed by the Nazis, or ''The Big Knife,'' Robert Aldrich's acclaimed 1955 potboiler about a Hollywood superstar (Jack Palance) who defies a studio boss (Rod Steiger). Along with about 100 other titles, the films have landed in Amazon's MGM Movie Vault, an accumulation of old movies that have either never been on video before or, like these two, have been out of circulation for a while. Of the hundreds of movies missing on video, why these? ''We checked our search logs and saw films people were looking for,'' said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. With a library of thousands of movies, MGM has no objection to selling any or all of them, but, as has been the case since the dawn of video, suppliers need to identify what people want.
2001-03-19	Patents; Even with a bounty, no claims appear to nullify Amazon.com's 'one-click' shopping device.	A CONTEST offering a reward for proof that Amazon.com did not originate the idea behind its ''one-click'' patent ended last week without finding a clear winner. Instead, three entries will split the $10,000 reward for submitting the most promising leads among 30. Judges at BountyQuest, a Web site that allows participants to offer rewards for material that would question the validity of a patent, did conclude that one European and two United States patents described ways of making digital shopping quicker and easier. But the company said that none of the three met BountyQuest's 12 requirements for winning the anti-Amazon bounty, because they did not address all of the claims in the Amazon patent.
2001-03-11	In the War on Gibberish, a New Investor Ally	DURING the bull market of the 1990's, great towers of Babel, like the one in the biblical region of Shinar, were erected by much of corporate America. From these towers spewed the spin on company performance or prospects that was needed to support swollen stock prices. Unlike the outcome in Shinar, where the tower builders were thwarted by a confusion of tongues, now investors are the frustrated ones. They must make sense of the blather masquerading as financial information emanating from many companies today.
2001-03-10	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about trading by the chairman of Amazon.com, Jeffrey P. Bezos, misstated the number of its shares he has sold since 1997. It is 2.1 million, not 1.3 million. His sales of 800,000 shares in February accounted for 36 percent of the total he sold -- not almost two-thirds of the total.
2001-03-09	S.E.C. Is Said To Investigate Amazon Chief	The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating stock sales by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chairman of Amazon.com, in early February just before a Wall Street firm released a negative research report on the company, according to a person close to the matter. In documents filed with regulators on Feb. 2 and Feb. 5, Mr. Bezos said he intended to sell 800,000 Amazon shares worth about $12.2 million. One week earlier, Amazon executives had received an advance copy of a research report by Ravi Suria, a convertible bond analyst at Lehman Brothers. Mr. Suria's report, which was made public on Feb. 6, questioned Amazon's ability to continue operating through 2001 and said the company's deteriorating financial condition could subject it to a credit squeeze this year.
2001-02-15	Putting a Price on the Free Lunch	CALL me stingy, but I can't think of a single time I suddenly got the urge to pay for something I had been getting free and could continue to get free. But that is exactly what Amazon.com had in mind last week when it instigated a new scheme called the Honor System. It's a way for people to use the one-click-shopping concept to make voluntary payments from $1 to $50 for intangible things -- humor, advice, recipes -- that they usually get free from Internet sites like Hearing Voices.com, an archive of radio clips, and SatireWire, which publishes humorous articles.
2001-02-15	Injunction Against Barnesandnoble.com Is Overturned	A federal appeals court in Washington freed Barnesandnoble.com yesterday to allow customers to buy books on its Web site with one mouse click, at least until a trial considers an assertion by Amazon.com that such transactions infringe its patent. The case began in October 1999, when Amazon contended that the Express Lane feature on Barnesandnoble.com was too close to its own 1-Click method on which it held a patent. In December of that year, a federal judge in Seattle issued an injunction against Barnesandnoble, ruling that Amazon had a substantial likelihood of prevailing in its suit. The ruling was a surprise because such injunctions are rare in patent cases.
2001-02-13	AMAZON TO OFFER DOWNLOADS	Amazon.com has decided that even overnight delivery is not fast enough for some people. The online retailer began offering a software downloading service yesterday that allows customers to buy some software online and then to start using the products almost immediately. The announcement of the new service, which is called the Software Downloads Store, is timed to take advantage of tax-filing season, when many people are seeking fast access to software that is used in tax preparation. The company is also selling several other kinds of programs electronically. Laurie J. Flynn
2001-02-07	THE MARKETS: Market Place; A Lehman Bond Analyst Paints a No-Nonsense Portrait of Amazon	When executives at Amazon.com announced the company's fourth-quarter results last week, they said that this would be the year that the Internet retailer would finally turn the corner toward profitability. But yesterday, Ravi Suria, an influential convertible bond analyst at Lehman Brothers, published a report arguing that this may be the year in which both time and money run out for Amazon. Taking a sharp pencil to Amazon's balance sheet, Mr. Suria assessed the company's ability to finance its operations with what is known as working capital, or the difference between Amazon's near-term liabilities and its relatively liquid assets. Because those liabilities have been growing faster than have the assets, the report stated, the retailer's working capital is dwindling. And unless the company can raise money from investors or get a loan from a bank, Mr. Suria stated that Amazon's working capital would turn negative in the third quarter -- just as it gears up for the Christmas selling season.
2001-02-04	A Buyer's Market: The Dot-Com Liquidation Sale	WHEN it comes to shopping, Lorie Tuma knows her way around the Internet, using its vast breadth of information on products and prices to get the best deals. But recently, she found something that took her bargain-hunting prowess to a new level. Checking out a link from America Online, she stumbled upon SmartBargains.com, which features overstocked and liquidated merchandise. There she bought an eight-place setting of Pfaltzgraff china for $39.99, less than half the price at a department store and below what was listed at the manufacturer's Web site. Shipping charges were only $5.95 and, better yet, the price included a few serving pieces.
2001-02-02	Amazing Amazon: Losses Grow as They Seem to Shrink	AMAZON.COM says it will be profitable in the fourth quarter of this year. But what does that mean? It does not mean Amazon will have net income. The forecast is for ''pro forma operating profitability,'' a number Amazon computes by ignoring lots of expenses.
2001-02-01	Amazon Offer Links Profit To Share Price	Amazon.com announced today that it was offering to lower the price of existing employee options, making it subject to an accounting rule that will directly tie its financial results to fluctuations in its shares. The repricing offer, filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, lets employees swap existing options for new options that have a lower exercise price. Many technology companies, faced with plunging shares, have made similar moves for the stated reason of retaining employees whose options would otherwise be worthless.
2001-01-31	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Amazon, Facing Slowdown, Cuts 1,300 Jobs	Faced with a sharp downturn in its sales growth, Amazon.com said yesterday that it would close two operations centers and lay off 1,300 people, or 15 percent of its work force. With those job cuts, Amazon's biggest layoffs ever, the company said it expected to show an operating profit in the fourth quarter of this year. Although that does not mean Amazon will necessarily turn a profit based on conventional accounting methods, it was the first time the company promised investors a profit of any kind -- a crucial milestone in an market increasingly skeptical that online retailing is viable even for Amazon, operator of the largest Web store.
2001-01-23	ONLINE ADS CLIMB TO RECORD	Online advertising impressions increased 21 percent in December 2000 over the previous month, reaching a record high of more than 65 billion, despite increasingly negative perceptions of the online advertising industry, according to a report by AdRelevance in New York, part of Jupiter Media Metrix. According to the report, Yahoo led all sites with more than 7.5 billion ad impressions during December 2000. MSN brought in the most ad revenue that month, $180 million, with an average of $486,000 in revenue per advertiser. Amazon.com led all online advertisers in ad spending with more than $61.8 million, 42 percent of which was on MSN. Allison Fass (NYT)
2001-01-09	Amazon Says Sales Meet Target, but Profit Margins Shrink	Amazon.com said yesterday that it just barely made its sales targets for the fourth quarter, but it sacrificed its profit margins to do so. As the largest merchant on the Internet, Amazon is the most significant bellwether of electronic commerce. And the announcement was consistent with other indicators that showed that online sales were up sharply from a year ago, but at a slower pace than expected.
2001-01-08	Compressed Data; Tracking a Suspect On an Online Trail	Whenever there is a well-publicized crime these days, a modern ritual is set in motion: The online citizenry starts nosing through databases and search engines to seek meaning in the digital detritus of a suspected criminal's life. And so in the wake of the Dec. 26 shooting deaths of seven employees of Edgewater Technology in suburban Boston, the online world began deconstructing the Net persona of the suspected gunman, Michael M. McDermott, 42.
2001-01-04	Tales About E-Tailers	To the Editor: I, too, experienced Amazon.com letdown. I ordered two Nintendo games, asked that they be shipped at the same time and paid a premium for guaranteed delivery by Dec. 22 only to find that Amazon on its own decided to ship one item first and gave no indication of when the second item (for which there was more demand) would be available, even though the Web site indicated that it ''usually ships in 24 hrs'' and was available. Numerous e-mail messages to Amazon resulted in an automatic e-mail reply saying it would get back to me at some point when it felt like it. I canceled the unshipped portion of the order but was unable to cancel the first item since Amazon had already shipped it without adhering to my request to ship both items together. I will never go back to Amazon again -- it's not worth the hassle when it is supposed to save time. SHARON GREENBERG New York
2001-01-04	Tales About E-Tailers	To the Editor: Amazon has, on several occasions, told me that something would be shipped in two weeks, only to tell me much later that it had been delayed. Since it happened more than once -- and I'd checked other places and had been told that the item would not be available for at least a month -- I believe that Amazon tries to make the sale regardless of whether it can ship what it says it can. Amazon did exactly that to me on a book that I was counting on as a Christmas gift last year. I canceled the order and placed it with AlphaCraze. MIKE DILBECK Kennesaw, Ga.
2000-12-28	Promises, Promises	To the Editor: I did most of my Christmas shopping this year on the Internet, and most of that was with Amazon. Of all the orders I placed (including three at Amazon), everything arrived early except an order I placed at Amazon on Dec. 13 (Amazon warned me that it might not arrive by Christmas, and I was prepared to take my chances, but it showed up on Christmas Eve).
2000-12-28	Promises, Promises	To the Editor: Re ''Hard to Tell When a Virtual Shelf Is Bare,'' Online Shopper, Dec. 21: My daughter lives in Kentucky, I live in Hawaii and I thought that if I ordered her present early from the best and biggest online merchant, Amazon.com, I'd be O.K. I am angry because I ordered the Christmas present on Dec. 10, and the item was available and supposed to be shipped in 24 hours. After placing the order I waited to see my item shipped. By Dec. 17, I noticed that it had not been shipped, and I knew that it would never arrive in time.
2000-12-24	A Hot Kosher Cookbook	It's not unusual to find a school's fund-raising cookbook for sale. But it is far from typical to find one for sale at Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble. The Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy-Yeshiva High School, a modern Orthodox school in Livingston, put out the ''The Kosher Palette'' last March. Now in its third printing, it has sold 15,000 copies. Sandra Blank and Susie Fishbein solicited recipes from other school parents, and sold the resulting book in local stores and through the school. But, Ms. Fishbein said, word spread and within weeks Amazon.com called her, saying it had received many inquiries about the book. She said the book filled a need for a kosher cookbook for everyday use. The book, $26.95, can be still be purchased directly from the school at (973) 597-1115, extension 197, but sales from any source all bring money into the school. One reader-reviewer on Amazon said, ''This is a book to drool over.''
2000-12-24	Behind That Good News At Amazon	FOR investors perusing the stock market's after-Christmas sales racks, the shares of Amazon.com look especially alluring. They have lost 85 percent of their value in the last 12 months. As of the close on Friday, it cost just $15.56 a share to buy into the brilliance of Jeff Bezos, Time magazine's 1999 Person of the Year. The chance that Amazon's Christmas sales may come in higher than some investors expect only adds to its appeal. Its stock could pop on the news.
2000-12-14	Hate on the Web	To the Editor: ''Mainstream Sites Serve as Portals to Hate'' (Nov. 30) mentioned that Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com had come under fire for selling ''Mein Kampf,'' Hitler's autobiography. Much more serious is their selling ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,'' even though it is a forgery perpetrated by Russian anti-Semites. Most people are familiar with what ''Mein Kampf'' is, but that is not true of ''The Protocols,'' which is why it is so serious -- the book could mistakenly be taken for fact, thereby perpetuating a lie. MALCA I. BLUM Woodbridge, Conn.
2000-12-13	AMAZON LEADS IN HOLIDAY ADVERTISING	Amazon.com is the top online advertiser so far this holiday season, according to a report that is to be released today by AdRelevance in New York, part of Jupiter Media Metrix, which reported that Amazon had occupied the No. 1 overall online advertiser spot in eight of the last nine weeks and had attracted more than a half-billion impressions on online holiday-themed ads each week since October. In addition, the AdRelevance report found that Amazon had been devoting much of its online advertising to direct marketing; 70 percent of the retailer's top 10 online ads offer free shipping. Allison Fass (NYT)
2000-12-08	Taking on the world, Amazon.com unexpectedly breaks up with FCB San Francisco.	AMAZON.COM, the online retailer whose performance during the holiday shopping season is being scrutinized by Wall Street, is unexpectedly searching for an agency of record to handle its advertising worldwide. The review comes as Amazon.com parts ways with its American agency of three and a half years, the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications. Amazon was one of several large advertisers making account news, along with Samsung, BMW of North America, a new spinoff of Lucent Technologies and Pfizer.
2000-12-07	AMAZON TO OFFER CONSUMER REPORTS	Amazon.com Inc. said it had reached an agreement with Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, to distribute product reports and advice to Amazon.com customers. Terms were not disclosed. Amazon.com will offer free product summaries in relevant areas throughout its Web site, with full information to be available early next year on a pay-per-view basis, the companies said.
2000-12-05	INQUIRY ASKED ON AMAZON PRIVACY CHANGES	Privacy groups in the United States and Europe called on government agencies yesterday to investigate Amazon.com, saying the Internet retailer had violated laws on both sides of the Atlantic when it changed its privacy policy last summer. In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, the two groups, the Electronic Privacy Information Center and a company called Junkbusters, asked the F.T.C. to determine if Amazon had engaged in deceptive trade practices by collecting personal information on its customers then changing its privacy policy to permit the sale of that information.

2000-12-04	Holiday Traffic at Online-Only Stores Lags Chains' Sites	It is not just investors who are spurning some major dot-com companies, so are online shoppers. Even though Internet use and online shopping are still growing briskly, most of the major Internet-only stores have flat to declining traffic, according to studies of activity over the Thanksgiving weekend.
2000-11-29	Amazon.com Is Using the Web to Block Unions' Effort to Organize	Amazon.com has come out swinging in its fight to stop a new unionization drive, telling employees that unions are a greedy, for-profit business and advising managers on ways to detect when a group of workers is trying to back a union. A section on Amazon's internal Web site gives supervisors antiunion material to pass on to employees, saying that unions mean strife and possible strikes and that while unions are certain to charge expensive dues, they cannot guarantee improved wages or benefits.
2000-11-23	Unions Pushing to Organize Thousands of Amazon.com Workers	Seeking to exploit a major retailer's vulnerability during the holiday season, the labor movement has begun a broad campaign to unionize thousands of workers at Amazon.com in what is labor's most ambitious foray into the new economy. The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, an arm of the Communications Workers of America, is seeking to organize 400 of the company's customer-service workers in Seattle. At the same time, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and an independent organizing group are seeking to unionize more than 5,000 workers at the eight distribution centers across the country used by Amazon.
2000-11-21	Testing the Retailing Net; This Holiday Season Is Critical for Many Online Merchants	The online retailing business is looking like the last episodes of ''Survivor.'' Last year, Web merchants came to the holiday retail party spending like the rowdiest of the nouveaux riches. They saturated television screens with obnoxious advertisements, sold goods at cost or below and panicked many established retailers into spending tens of millions of dollars -- and in at least one case nearly a billion -- to meet their threat.
2000-11-07	HACKING SUSPECT CASE ADVANCES	A Montreal judge yesterday scheduled a December court hearing for a 16-year-old boy accused of sabotaging prominent Web sites like Yahoo, Amazon, eBay and Dell. The suspect, who cannot be publicly identified because of his age, is accused of hijacking computers at leading universities in the United States and then using them to attack popular Web sites. Robert Frank (NYT)
2000-11-02	Tracking Book Bargains	To the Editor: I have recently noted a substantial change at Amazon.com. Items marked ''usually ships in 24 hours'' now take up to five days with no apparent explanation. That happens more often now than in the past and has actually forced me into my car for the difficult two-mile journey to an actual bookstore. DAVID P. BERMAN Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
2000-11-02	Hewlett-Packard sends Amazon.com a big 'thank you' just in time for the holidays.	ADVERTISING run by a supplier on behalf of a customer usually attracts as much attention as a Bush-Cheney rally in Cambridge, Mass., or a Gore-Lieberman rally in Salt Lake City. But a television campaign that the Hewlett-Packard Company is about to start running on behalf of Amazon.com should turn some heads. The humorous commercials are part of an agreement reached last November whereby Amazon.com, the online retailing giant, switched its supplier of information technology products like servers to Hewlett-Packard from Sun Microsystems and prominently features Hewlett-Packard merchandise like printers on the Electronics Store section of its Web site.
2000-11-02	AMAZON MOVES INTO JAPAN . . .	The online retailer Amazon.com introduced a Japanese-language Web site offering more than 1.7 million Japanese and English titles. The new site (Amazon.co.jp) will also include book reviews, recommendation lists and interviews with authors and translators. ''We can now make our customer-centric shopping experience -- great service, selection and convenience -- available to everyone looking for popular or hard-to-find Japanese-language books,'' said Jeff Bezos, above, the company's chief executive. Japan is Amazon's fourth foreign operation, after Germany, Britain and France, and the first one in Asia. Despite Mr. Bezos's enthusiasm, many analysts and industry observers are cool on Amazon's move in Japan. The market has begun to look crowded, with dozens of players including Kinokuniya, a big book retailer; E-Shopping Books, backed by Softbank; and Bertelsmann's BOL.com. Miki Tanikawa
2000-10-25	Amazon.com Surpasses Wall St. Forecast	Amazon.com beat Wall Street's expectations yesterday, posting higher sales and a lower loss than expected in the third quarter. The company lost $241 million in the quarter, 22 percent more than the $197.1 million it lost in the year-earlier quarter. On a per-share basis, the loss was 68 cents a share, compared with 59 cents in 1999.
2000-10-23	Patents; A Web site invites bounty hunters to disprove ownership of ideas, even those of its founders.	TO opponents of business-methods patents, Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, has become a poster boy for his patent covering a ''one click'' electronic ordering system. One critic has been Tim O'Reilly, a publisher of software books and online information, who posted an open letter to Mr. Bezos on his Web site last winter. In the letter, Mr. O'Reilly called the Amazon patent ''one more example of an 'intellectual property' milieu gone mad,'' and said it was ''a land grab, an attempt to hoodwink a patent system that has not gotten up to speed on the state of the art in computer science.''
2000-10-12	Corrections	A front-page article on Monday about rising prices in bookstores referred incorrectly to prices of discounted books at Amazon.com. They have risen by 10 percent of list price, not 10 percent of the previously discounted prices.
2000-10-11	There's No Fair Price	To the Editor: In his Oct. 4 column about price fairness and Amazon.com's charging different customers different amounts for the same products, Paul Krugman raises an interesting issue that is at the heart of all transactions in our new economy. The idea is to charge the maximum price that the individual or the market at large can bear without any regard to the cost of production or ''fairness.'' The dictum is in evidence from health care (different prices for different patients for the same procedures and drugs, depending on who is paying for it) to automobiles to open bidding for public and private contracts. Further, even if cost was a consideration for pricing, the relevant cost is debatable -- should it be based on full cost, marginal cost or life-cycle cost?
2000-10-09	Quietly, Booksellers Are Putting an End To the Discount Era	Fifteen years ago, a handful of fast-growing national bookstore chains started a price war on discounting books that became one of the momentous trends in the book business. Widespread markdowns on best sellers, tens of thousands of other hardcover titles and even paperbacks delighted consumers and increased book sales. The low prices lured customers to the national chains from independent stores and pumped up best sellers' sales by making them much cheaper than other titles. And when Amazon.com joined the game five years ago, its online book store upped the ante on competitive discounts.
2000-10-06	OPENTV ASSERTS 'ONE-CLICK' SHOPPING CLAIM	An interactive media systems company, OpenTV, has filed a claim to broaden one of its patents to include ''one-click'' shopping and set-top storage of personal data, which the company says may supersede the patent that Amazon.com is trying to assert against Barnesandnoble.com. OpenTV asked the federal Patent and Trademark Office to expand the scope of its original patent to include the TV commerce technology. OpenTV said because of the early filing date of its original patent, and the publication of the European equivalent patent application, ''Amazon could be precluded from using its patents against'' anyone else using the technology. Amazon.com has filed suit against Barnesandnoble.com, saying that its one-click ordering system infringed on a patent it was awarded in September. ''One-click'' systems store users' billing and shipping information so they do not have to be re-entered on each visit.
2000-10-04	Toy Giant Announces Japan Net Plans	Toys ''R'' Us Inc. announced its Internet strategy in Japan today, including a new Japanese-language e-commerce site and a potential linkup with the online retailer Amazon.com Inc. The online unit, Toysrus.com, said it was planning to start the Japanese online retail site before this Christmas with two Japanese partners, the Softbank Corporation and the Japanese operations of the McDonald's Corporation.
2000-09-19	Bookseller and Yahoo to Announce Pact	After being pilloried by investors for failing to capitalize on its parent company's 550 stores and well-known brand, the three-year-old online spinoff Barnesandnoble.com is making its biggest bid yet to woo the chain's customers through a marketing agreement with the Web portal Yahoo, which will provide free Internet access to Barnes & Noble customers. The deal, which is expected to be announced today, will also significantly bolster Barnesandnoble.com's exposure on the Web by making it the most prominent bookseller on the Yahoo site. Yahoo is the most popular site on the Web. Barnesandnoble.com replaces Amazon.com, which did not renew its three-year marketing pact with Yahoo. Barnesandnoble.com will also sell books, music and videos in Yahoo's online shopping network, paying Yahoo an undisclosed commission on its sales.
2000-09-14	Undercover Buying, Fake Names and All	THERE are a lot of things I do on Amazon.com that I don't necessarily want everyone to know about. The day I compared prices on home pregnancy tests comes to mind. So does the time that I placed a Bruce Springsteen CD in my shopping cart, then removed it after being teased by my husband (who refers to the aging Mr. Springsteen as ''the Wayne Newton of our generation''). I am embarrassed about the hours I waste checking the sales ranks of books I have written.
2000-09-01	HOW AMAZON USES INFORMATION	Amazon.com, the No. 1 Internet retailer, has revised its privacy policy, and in doing so has provided a window into how much it uses the customer data it collects to help it and other companies sell more. In the new policy, Amazon disclosed that it has started sending e-mail marketing messages on behalf of other companies. It also added a long list of data it collects about users, including financial information, Social Security numbers, product searches and the telephone number from which a user calls Amazon's customer service line. And for the first time, Amazon disclosed it can buy information about customers from outside databases. And if the new initiatives do not help stem Amazon's huge losses and the company is put up for sale, the new policy says, anyone who buys Amazon will get its customer data. Saul Hansell (NYT)
2000-08-30	AMAZON.COM TO OPEN FRENCH WEB SITE	The online retailer Amazon.com will open a French-language Web site, selling books, music and videos. The new site, Amazon.fr, is the company's third venture outside the United States, after online stores for Britain and Germany. A spokeswoman said the company hoped to serve French speakers outside of France as well. Amazon.com, based in Seattle, will operate the French site from offices in Guyancourt and a distribution center in Orleans. Separately, Amazon.com announced that it had expanded its marketing alliance with America Online. No terms were disclosed. David D. Kirkpatrick
2000-08-29	Competing Alliances Set In Electronic Book Field	Stepping up the competition to define a standard format for electronic publishing, Microsoft and Adobe Systems both announced rival alliances intended to strengthen their respective positions in the growing market. The companies produce competing software programs intended to make reading on a screen easier on the eyes.
2000-08-28	E-Commerce Report; Internet companies learn how to personalize service.	ASK a handful of Internet executives to define the term ''personalization,'' and invariably the conversation turns to the analogy of a shopkeeper who knows not only his customers' names, but how much they can afford to spend and what size shirt they wear. Never mind that most Americans shop at retail chains where, if they happen to be greeted by a clerk, they are more likely than not to respond, ''Thanks, I'm just looking.'' This old-fashioned ideal of personalized service -- albeit, updated with new economy motives -- is the next hurdle for Internet companies trying to achieve profitability in an increasingly competitive environment.
2000-08-24	Amazon.com Plans to Offer Cars Online	Amazon.com, one of the world's largest online retailers, announced today that it would begin offering a car-selling service on the Internet, the latest and potentially most serious in a series of challenges to automakers' ability to control the distribution of automobiles. Beginning early Thursday morning, Amazon shoppers will be able to compare features for hundreds of models from various brands. They will be able to configure a chosen car or light truck with various options and then obtain a price quote and estimated delivery date for their vehicle. But while buyers will be able to put down a deposit on their chosen vehicle through Amazon, using their credit cards, customers will buy the vehicle itself from a local dealer, either at a dealership or by having dealership employees deliver it to their door.
2000-08-11	Two Big Online Toy Sellers to Merge Units	Toys ''R'' Us and Amazon.com said yesterday that they were merging their online toy-sales units, an acknowledgment that selling toys on the Internet has been too hard for each of them alone. Starting later this year, toysrus .com will direct users to a toy section of Amazon.com. Customers will be able to use their Amazon accounts to buy toys, books, tools and other merchandise in a single order that will be shipped in one box.
2000-08-07	Online Superstore Pushes Into Digital; Barnesandnoble.com Stakes Turf Despite Bloodied Stock and Losses	Stephen Riggio remembers telling executives at Barnes & Noble that the Internet was the future of bookselling in 1994, before Amazon.com had even begun. But he has never gotten much credit for it. By the time he founded Barnesandnoble.com, in 1997, Barnes & Noble had become watchwords for letting an Internet upstart eat your lunch. Last week should have been heartening. Amazon.com lost its president, missed its revenue projections and saw its stock plummet amid doubts about its ability to branch into new markets. One Lehman Brothers analyst even questioned how long the company would be able to pay its bills.
2000-08-01	Dip Into a Book, Physically and Virtually	To the Editor:
2000-07-30	Piling On Amazon's Stock, After the Fact	RATS leaving a sinking ship. That unfortunate metaphor sprang to mind last Thursday when a pack of formerly bullish stock analysts suddenly cooled on the shares of Amazon.com.
2000-07-27	Amazon Reports Losses of $317 Million in the 2nd Quarter	Amazon.com said yesterday that it had lost $317 million in the second quarter of the year, slightly less than analysts had expected, and asserted that it had stanched the heavy drain on its cash reserves that has raised doubts in the minds of many investors. The company, the largest online retailer, posted sales of $578 million, up 84 percent from a year earlier. But that was less than analysts had expected and below the company's own internal target of 90 percent growth.
2000-07-26	President of Amazon Quits for VerticalNet	Joseph Galli, it seems, isn't one to mull major career moves for a long time. Just over a year ago, Mr. Galli, a 19-year veteran of Black & Decker, accepted the job as chief executive of Pepsico's Frito-Lay division, then hours later changed his mind to become the president and chief operating officer of Amazon.com instead. Yesterday, Mr. Galli said he would quit Amazon to become president and chief executive of VerticalNet, an Internet company that runs 56 Web sites devoted to specific industries, like Pollution Online. He took the job only a week after meeting Mark Walsh, VerticalNet's current chief executive, over dinner at an industry conference. Mr. Walsh will become chairman of VerticalNet, which is based in Horsham, Pa.
2000-07-24	Making Money Vs. Doing Good?	Silicon Valley entrepreneurs fall into two categories, John Doerr, the Valley's most prominent venture capitalist, told a group of Internet executives last week. There are the missionaries, he said, and there are the mercenaries. ''Missionaries obsess on the customer,'' explained Mr. Doerr, a partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. By way of an example, he offered Jeff Bezos, the somewhat embattled chief executive of Amazon.com, a Kleiner investment.
2000-07-16	Critics 'R' Us: Shakespeare Was a Hack	BOOK critics can be a pompous, self-important lot. Many people gripe that they are out of touch with the common reader and that their highfalutin academic tastes have no relation to what the masses might enjoy. As with every other aspect of modern life, the Internet -- specifically Amazon.com -- has leveled the literary playing field. The Web site's customers can review books and post their critiques, and thousands of them have tapped out their thoughts and donated them to the digital universe. (Amazon even ranks its most prolific critics, with the current No. 1 spot held by a former librarian, Harriet Klausner, who at last count had weighed in on 545 titles.)
2000-07-14	Elaborate musical commercials are making a comeback.	ALL singing! All dancing! All selling! Television commercials that feature elaborate musical production numbers, long out of favor on Madison Avenue, are making a comeback. Big advertisers like Amazon.com, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gap, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Visa are offering viewers minimusicals with maxi-casts for products as disparate as books, shampoo, apparel, soft drinks, cleaners and credit cards.
2000-07-02	Anything for Her Boy	Jeff Bezos has found a straight man for his presentations. Or woman. Her name is Jackie Bezos, a k a Mom. At last week's PC Expo in New York, Mr. Bezos displayed her wish list, online at Amazon.com, to show how easy it was for friends to order appropriate gifts. A Casio camera for $999.99? ''Let her buy it herself,'' Mr. Bezos said. But seeing that she also wanted Motorola's palm-sized walkie talkies at $109.99 each, he clicked and ordered one. ''You have to get two of them,'' a member of the audience hollered.
2000-06-24	Analysts Talk and Amazon.com Shares Reel	Shares of Amazon.com, the Internet industry's bellwether stock, plummeted 19 percent in heavy trading yesterday as investors grew nervous about the company's financial health and its prospects for profitability. Other Internet companies were sucked into the downdraft; shares of eBay fell 7.4 percent and America Online lost 5.3 percent of its value. Yesterday's decline in Amazon shares appeared to be a reaction to comments issued by two research analysts at influential Wall Street firms. Ravi Suria, a credit analyst at Lehman Brothers, wrote a report on Amazon's $2 billion in bonds issued during the last few years, calling into question the company's financial strength and ability to generate cash to repay bondholders. For Amazon to be a successful business, Mr. Suria wrote, ''it must be able to generate the cash operating profile of a successful retailer.
2000-06-18	So It Goes	To the Editor: In her essay ''Navigating the Amazon Circle'' (May 21), Katie Hafner makes fun of Amazon.com's purchase circles, which tell you what groups are interested in a given book and what other books a given group seems to like. I agree that most of what turns up in such ''data dicing'' exercises is likely to be trivial, but I recently found a tidbit I consider meaningful. I was ordering a copy of Kurt Vonnegut's ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' for a bat mitzvah present, and I saw that it was popular at the United States Military Academy. I clicked up the top 20 books ordered at West Point, and mixed in with ''The Art of War,'' ''The Face of War,'' some World War II memoirs and books on physical fitness was Vonnegut's book, which could have been titled ''The Face of Massacre.'' I find it very comforting to think that even a smattering of the cadets at West Point might be giving some thought to what it's like when war goes crazy. David Grant San Antonio
2000-06-01	Hewlett Wins Amazon.com Contract	The Hewlett-Packard Company, the No. 2 computer maker, won a contract yesterday to supply 90 percent of the computers that run the business of Amazon.com Inc., replacing machines from Sun Microsystems Inc. and the Compaq Computer Corporation. Analysts valued the agreement at about $500 million. Amazon.com bought Hewlett-Packard machines for the first time in November, choosing them over Sun. Hewlett-Packard also said it would sell more printers, scanners and cameras on Amazon.com's Web site, the biggest store on the Internet.
2000-05-25	AMAZON HEAD FILES FOR FIRST SALE OF SHARES SINCE '98	Jeffrey Bezos, chief executive of the online retailer Amazon.com Inc., has filed to sell 380,000 shares of the company, in his first sale since 1998. The sales will provide fianancing for investments and other commitments, according to Patty Smith, a spokeswoman for Amazon.com. Ms. Smith noted that the stock reported in the sale represents less than 1 percent of the 117.5 million shares that Mr. Bezos held as of Feb. 29. Mr. Bezos listed the date of sale as May 12 in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
2000-05-23	First Winner Is Ruled Out Of an Award	Last Monday, the first PEN/ Amazon.com Short Story Award was announced and Meera Nair of Brooklyn won the prize. It was one of the largest prizes for an undiscovered writer -- for her work entitled ''Video,'' about the havoc wrought on a young Indian couple's marriage by the sexually explicit culture of the West. With a disclaimer, Amazon is running the full text of the story despite some complaints over the graphic descriptions of sex -- and despite the fact that the story was found to be ineligible for the award. On Friday, Amazon and PEN rescinded the prize, which includes $10,000 and publication on Amazon and in The Boston Book Review, and gave it to someone else when it was discovered that Ms. Nair's fiction had been published previously in a national magazine with a circulation of more than 10,000. This made her ineligible for the prize.
2000-05-21	Navigating the Amazon Circle	Introduce a computer to a heap of raw data and the temptation to slice the information every which way can prove irresistible. One example is Amazon.com's purchase-circle program, which enables customers to see what books are popular among different groups. Apparently, the idea is that readers can learn the buying preferences of people with whom they might have something in common, or about whom they might be curious, and that one can glean insights into a place or company by seeing, for instance, that a top seller in Kenya is ''The Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program'' or that in Hoboken, N.J., a number of people want to know how to put on a Jewish wedding. Amazon has two types of purchase-circle lists. There are rankings strictly by the numbers, and the Harry Potter books invariably top the list. More interesting are the ''uniquely best-selling'' books -- titles that are more popular with a particular group than among Amazon.com customers generally.
2000-05-17	Saudi Reports $1 Billion of Investments	Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia said today that he had spent $1 billion buying shares in 15 American companies, including Amazon.com, WorldCom, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and AT&T. ''We bought all these companies, which are here for the long run, after their share prices had collapsed by as much as 70 percent,'' Prince Walid said. ''We are not old economy; we are not new economy; we go everywhere there is value and growth potential.''
2000-05-10	What is a dot-com brand name worth? A new survey has some not-too-surprising answers.	MUCH has been made of the need for dot-coms to generate awareness of their names among computer users. Internet companies are spending billions of dollars online, in print and on television to establish their brands. Now comes a study that tries to identify the winners and losers in the big branding struggle. The study, which was conducted in October and released in mid-April by Greenfield Online, an Internet market research company based in Wilton, Conn., surveyed about 3,400 computer users. Among 100 Internet names placed before the respondents, Microsoft.com has the highest ''brand power,'' defined as a combination of rankings in three categories: brand familiarity, the brand's ability to affect the Internet landscape and the brand's perceived financial strength.
2000-05-03	Amazon's in the Kitchen	Amazon.com's new cooking destination (Amazon.comkitchen) is a full-service Web site, offering cookware and housewares, equipment evaluations by writers at Cook's Illustrated, plus recipes and tips from cookbook authors.
2000-04-27	Amazon.com Reports a Loss of $308 Million	Amazon.com, the biggest retailer on the Internet, said yesterday that it lost $308 million in the first quarter, five times its loss a year earlier, but that its sales rose 95 percent, beating forecasts. The quarterly loss translated into 90 cents a share, compared with a loss of $61.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. But Amazon said investors should focus on its pro-forma loss, which excludes the cost of stock options, merger costs and Amazon's share of the losses of the companies in which it has invested. On that basis, Amazon lost $122 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with a loss of $36 million, or 12 cents a share a year earlier.
2000-04-23	The Maniac Markets; E-tailers on Sale	No new-economy sector has taken a worse smack on the chin than Internet retailers. Stock prices of merchants like eToys and Bluefly started plunging well in advance of the Nasdaq downswing. As a group, the stocks remained depressed well after technology stocks started to rebound last week. Are such shares bargain-basement buys or damaged goods? Amazon.com remains the 800-pound gorilla of Internet retailers, with a market capitalization of more than $18 billion. And in many ways, Amazon exhibits the attractions -- and vulnerabilities -- of the group. Sell-side analysts remain as bullish on the company as they were a year ago, even though the stock has fallen 50 percent, to $52.375, from a 52-week high of $113 on Dec. 9. Of the 28 analysts who follow the stock, 11 rate it a strong buy and 10 rate it a buy, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
2000-04-23	The Maniac Markets; Seeking Solid Ground Amid Falling Bodies	BLUE chips? Or wooden nickels? Investors in the leading technology stocks might be wondering how to appraise them after the plunge of early April left the technology sector as skinny as a football lineman on an all-broccoli diet.
2000-04-01	2 Auction Sites on Web Accede To Federal Product Safeguards	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said today that two of the biggest Internet auction sites had agreed to new safeguards to protect people from buying dangerous second-hand products via the Web. The agency said the auction sites, eBay of San Jose, Calif., and Amazon.com Auctions of Seattle, had agreed to links with the commission's site to warn buyers and sellers about products that had been deemed hazardous, or in some instances even outlawed.
2000-03-21	AMAZON.COM INVESTS $60 MILLION IN KOZMO.COM	Amazon.com, the biggest Internet retailer, said yesterday that it had invested $60 million in Kozmo.com, an online home-delivery service. The alliance will allow customers to receive orders within an hour, with Kozmo being an option for some book, music and toy orders. Amazon.com agreed to a three-year alliance in exchange for warrants to buy more shares of Kozmo, which is closely held. Kozmo delivers videos, snacks and other items bought online in New York, Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and Los Angeles. Shares of Amazon.com, based in Seattle, fell 62.5 cents, to $64.1875, in Nasdaq trading.
2000-03-12	Patently Absurd	When 21st-century historians look back at the breakdown of the United States patent system, they will see a turning point in the case of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com and their special invention: ''The patented One Click(R) feature,'' Bezos calls it. Not everyone who knows Bezos as the newly minted billionaire founder of the world's leading Internet retailer knows that he's also an inventor, but he is. It says so on U.S. Patent No. 5,960,411, ''Method and system for placing a purchase order via a communications network.'' Every good invention needs a story, and Jeff Bezos has one for one-click ordering. He's laying it out in federal court, where, at the height of the holiday shopping season, he won an injunction forcing his chief competitor, Barnesandnoble.com, to add deliberate complication to its ordering process.
2000-03-11	Chairman of Amazon Urges Reduction of Patent Terms	Other sites cried foul after Amazon.com, the online retailer, patented Internet innovations like a method for placing an order with a single mouse click, and an affiliate system that rewards other sites for referring business. Now Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chairman, has acknowledged that the terms under which those patents were granted may be unreasonable and may stifle others from building upon the patented innovations. He is calling for the government to limit patents for software and Internet business models to three to five years and to require a period for public comment on patent applications in those areas before they are granted.
2000-03-03	Foreign Affairs; Saga of An Online Pioneer	A year ago I wrote a column about Lyle Bowlin, a professor of small business in Cedar Falls, Iowa, who had started an online bookstore out of his spare bedroom. I used his story to illustrate the low barriers to entry for those wanting to compete on the Internet, even against Amazon.com. After the column ran, Mr. Bowlin's book site -- Positively-You.com -- was inundated with business and e-mail from moms and pops interested in starting e-businesses -- so much traffic it blew out his computer server. Thus inspired, Mr. Bowlin took a leave from teaching, raised $90,000, rented office space, hired employees, and decided to really try to compete with Amazon. Positively-you's cachet was that it donated 10 percent of the profit of every book you bought to the charity of your choice.
2000-02-23	An Oracle Spinoff Will Stress Cell Phone Access to the Internet	The Oracle Corporation's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, announced the formation and spinoff yesterday of a new business to capitalize on the industrywide push to make the Internet accessible over wireless phones and other portable devices. The new company, to be known as Oraclemobile.com, will be headed by Denise Lahey, Oracle's former vice president for mobile products. Mr. Ellison said the company would create partnerships with electronic commerce sites like Amazon.com or Travelocity to help translate their Web pages and transaction software into products accessible on cellular phones and personal organizers.
2000-02-17	How Not To Be A Zombie	IN the 1977 film ''Telefon,'' dozens of otherwise ordinary Good Guy citizens were secretly hypnotized and brainwashed by the Bad Guys. They lived and worked among their fellow Good Guys for months or years. Then one day, a simple telephone call from the Bad Guys triggered these pre-programmed Good Guys to stop whatever they were doing and, like zombies, to start attacking military bases and assassinating their own leaders. It is a brilliant science fiction concept, so brilliant, in fact, that it has been copied by computer hackers in the recent wave of attacks against well-known Internet commerce companies like Yahoo, Amazon.com, eBay, Buy.com, E-Trade and CNN.com.
2000-02-13	Secure or Not, the Internet Has Become a Part of Life's Routine	When Jon Tara first heard that unknown vandals with unclear motives had managed to sabotage several of the Internet's most prominent businesses last week, the San Diego software engineer posted a probing message to an online investing forum that he frequents. ''Is this the end of Internet innocence? Is the house of cards about to crumble?'' Mr. Tara, 45, wondered. ''Can we move to an Internet-based economy while the potential exists for a group of hackers to bring it to its knees at any time?''
2000-02-12	Amazon Sells Convertible 10-Year Notes	Amazon.com Inc., the online retailer, sold 690 million euros ($681 million) of convertible 10-year notes yesterday to finance expansion and investments in other online companies. The company paid an interest rate that was at the low end of expectations, enhancing demand by promising to make at least three years of interest payments even if the securities are converted into shares. The 6 7/8 percent coupon was above the 4 3/4 percent Amazon paid to sell convertible bonds in January 1999.
2000-02-11	Internet's Rich Are Giving It Away, Their Way	At 25, Nicholas Lovejoy left his $27,000-a-year job as a math teacher in suburban Seattle, took a pay cut and went to work for a friend, Jeff Bezos, just then establishing a start-up site on the World Wide Web. He was the fifth employee in the door at Amazon.com. At 28, proud of the company's strategic success but also conflicted about what he called its mission of ''trying to be the Wal-Mart of the Internet,'' Mr. Lovejoy sold his car, stored his belongings and took off with his girlfriend, Barbara Gordon, to travel around the world with a backpack. Even then, he could not help getting rich, as the value of his stock options kept multiplying.
2000-02-09	Several Web Sites Attacked Following Assault on Yahoo	SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8 -- Hackers mounted what appeared to be coordinated attacks on the world's largest electronic commerce sites today. The attacks, which opened a window on the widespread vulnerability of the Internet, began Monday with a three-hour assault on Yahoo.com, one of the world's most popular Web sites, and continued today, temporarily crippling at least four other major sites, including Amazon.com, eBay.com and Buy.com. By tonight it had spread to a leading media site, CNN.com.
2000-02-09	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Bond Market Seems Wary Of Amazon	Investors have long been happy to suspend their disbelief when they buy shares of Amazon.com. Jeff Bezos's plan to spend whatever he must to build Amazon.com into the must-stop for Web shopping has produced losses of $882 million since its creation in 1994. And even though the company reported that its book business actually made money in the most recent quarter, Amazon.com's overall business is still years away from turning a profit. None of this matters to stock investors, who have pushed Amazon.com's stock up nearly 20 percent since the fourth-quarter results were announced. But bond investors are another matter altogether. Pleasing them is proving to be a bit more difficult.
2000-02-06	Believing In the Future Of Amazon	IT'S probably a stretch for most people to imagine that the former Mets relief pitcher Tug McGraw and Jeff Bezos have much in common. But they do. In 1973, McGraw's ''Ya gotta believe'' mantra helped lift the Mets out of mediocrity to a National League pennant.
2000-02-03	Amazon Loss Soared 543% In 4th Quarter	Amazon.com, the leading proponent of losing money on the Internet to fuel rapid growth, said yesterday that it lost $323 million in the fourth quarter of last year, more than expected and 543 percent more than it lost in the quarter a year earlier. Once again, investors who seem charmed by the online retail giant's money-losing strategy appeared to celebrate the loss. Though the company announced its results after the close of trading on the Nasdaq exchange, where its shares finished the day at $69.4375, the price rose as high as $79 in after-hours trading.
2000-02-02	AMAZON.COM TO BUY INTO NET HOME-FURNISHINGS SELLER	The Internet retailer Amazon.com Inc. agreed yesterday to acquire an 18 percent interest in Living.com Inc., a closely held Internet home-furnishings retailer based in Austin, Tex., for an undisclosed amount. In exchange, Amazon, based in Seattle, will receive $145 million over five years for marketing Living.com on the Amazon Web site. Amazon also will receive rights to buy another 9 percent of the company. Amazon.com's stock rose $2.875 a share, to $67.4375.
2000-01-25	Amazon Bolsters Ties to Drugstore.com	Amazon.com Inc. said today that it had agreed to make Drugstore.com its pharmaceutical provider. The pact is the first instance of Amazon's agreeing to feature an investment partner permanently on its Web site.
2000-01-24	Autobytel Plans to Sell Cars Directly Over the Internet	Autobytel.com, the Internet car-buying service, plans to announce on Monday that it will act as a car broker by selling cars directly over the Internet. The announcement at the annual convention of car dealers here follows the news Friday that Amazon .com would get into the online car-selling business by taking a 5 percent stake in Greenlight.com. Both developments are part of a broader scramble by Internet companies to get into the mundane business of selling cars and car parts.
2000-01-16	Keeping a High Tone at Christie's	EVERY morning when Edward Dolman goes to work, he has to fight his way through the throngs outside the NBC studio windows as fans try to catch a glimpse of Katie Couric or Matt Lauer on the ''Today'' set. Mr. Dolman slips through unnoticed as he heads to a fifth-floor office with views of Rockefeller Center's Art Deco towers and its skating rink. In the auction and art world, however, where Mr. Dolman has worked for 16 years, his celebrity is growing. On Christmas Eve, Christie's sent an e-mail message to its staff announcing that he would be its new chief executive. While the name of Mr. Dolman, a sandy-haired Briton who had risen through the ranks at Christie's, had been bandied about within the company as a possible successor to Christopher Davidge, its chief for six years, many of its clients had never heard of him.
2000-01-02	Another Cover Curse at Time Inc.?	If one bit of history is any guide, you might be wise to avoid Amazon.com stock in 2000. Call it the curse of being named person of the year by Time magazine, which for 1999 picked Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder of Amazon, the money-losing Internet retailer that the market thinks is worth $27 billion.
1999-12-30	Bitter Debate on Privacy Divides Two Experts	Questions about the data-collection practices of a subsidiary of Amazon.com, the big Internet retailer, have erupted in a confrontation between a respected computer security expert and a renowned Internet pioneer. The security expert is Richard M. Smith, who has recently dedicated much of his professional life to uncovering what he sees as privacy violations arising from software flaws and e-commerce schemes.
1999-12-10	Amazon Leads Nasdaq to Record on Extremely Busy Day	The Nasdaq Composite Index rose to a record yesterday in the busiest day ever on the Nasdaq stock market, led by Amazon.com Inc., which benefited from optimism about holiday sales. ''Amazon.com is having an amazing day,'' said Tim Ghriskey, who helps to oversee about $120 billion at the Dreyfus Corporation. ''We have been saying all along that it will be a good seasonal shopping season and that the e-commmerce segment of the consumer dollar would skyrocket.''
1999-12-09	New Toy Ideas Dance in the Heads of Precocious Inventors	As the holiday season marches on, children fill their wish lists with action figures, Furbies and the oh-so-popular Pokemon. Next year there may be a new item on those lists: Mr. Itchy Pants. The wiggling stuffed doll, which sings ''I've Got Ants in My Pants,'' was chosen from 40 finalists as a grand-prize winner of a toy invention contest for children. It is expected to be manufactured and sold in time for next year's holiday season.
1999-12-04	Corrections	An article in Business Day yesterday about a patent dispute between Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com misstated Barnes & Noble's ownership stake in its online affiliate. The bookstore chain controls about 40 percent of the Internet company's stock, not a majority. The article also misspelled the last name of Barnesandnoble.com's chief executive. He is Jonathan B. Bulkeley, not Buckley.
1999-12-03	Amazon Wins Court Ruling to Protect Patent on Order System	Signaling that many common features on Web sites can be patented, a federal judge has ordered Barnesandnoble.com to stop using a ''one click ordering'' system that Amazon.com patented.
1999-11-28	Amazon's Risky Christmas	MAZON.COM has ordered 181 acres of holiday wrapping paper and 2,494 miles of red satin ribbon -- just in case. It has stocked its shelves with 10,000 copies of the Pack the Pig game and a few extra table saws. And it has built four new automated warehouses that give it the capacity to pack, wrap and ship nearly a million boxes a day. ''This is the fastest expansion of distribution capacity in peacetime history,'' gloated Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, the most popular store on the Internet. This holiday season, Mr. Bezos said, Amazon will send more packages -- perhaps in excess of 15 million -- to more people than any mail order company in the country.
1999-11-25	Online Company Settles Federal Charges	Alibris Inc. has paid $250,000 to settle federal charges that its predecessor company intercepted and stored e-mail sent between customers and Amazon.com Inc., the Justice Department said this week. Alibris, a leading online seller of rare and used books, also settled charges brought by the United States Attorney's office in Boston that it stored copies of confidential password files and the customer lists of competing Internet service providers, the department said.
1999-11-21	Online, or Else	The latest advice on cyber-etiquette: unplug your old office equipment if you're dealing with people who make their living from the Web. Brewster Kahle, chief executive of Alexa Internet, which he recently sold to Amazon.com for nearly $300 million, recently told the New York Infotech Forum that he communicates with his lawyers and accountants over the Internet, thank you. ''If they fax us anything,'' he warned, ''we look for a new one.''
1999-11-21	'Hold' Recommendation Of a Different Sort	The phones of some Wall Street analysts are ringing off the hook. No, the cause isn't telemarketers -- or even the corporate merger boom. Instead, they're ringing because some new-economy companies are posting on their Web sites the names, affiliations and direct phone numbers of analysts who track them. This has not endeared the companies to some analysts, who say they are having to field a growing number of calls from the public.
1999-11-18	NEWS WATCH	OUT OF DATE Participants in an Amazon.com online poll chose the Bible as the best book of the last 1,000 years. One problem: as Amazon pointed out, the Bible was not written in this millennium. So it was disqualified, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' (1954-56) took top honors.
1999-11-10	Amazon Further Expands Its Retail Reach	Feeding its audacious ambition to be the general store of the Internet, Amazon.com said yesterday that starting today, it would begin selling tools, video games and software. Amazon has already moved far from its beginnings as a bookseller, having added music, videos, toys and consumer electronics. And it lets other merchants use its site to hold auctions or run online stores.
1999-11-04	Free Software Sounds Alerts On Sites' Use of Personal Data	Amazon.com may have attracted 13 million shoppers, but how many of them really know what the company plans to do with their personal information? That is the question asked by Enonymous.com, a new company that wants to give Web surfers a more complete picture of exactly how sites plan to use their names, e-mail addresses and any other information they collect. The company, in San Diego, is distributing a free Internet utility called Enonymous Advisor. A computer equipped with the Advisor, which can be downloaded from www.enonymous.com, detects sites that request personal information. When a fill-in-the-blank form is opened on a user's Web browser, a window pops up with information about how the site rates on consumer privacy. The ratings are based on Enonymous's evaluation of the site's privacy policies.

1999-10-31	Over the Rainbow With Amazon.com	PAY no attention to those losses behind the curtain. Thus spake management at Amazon.com, the great and powerful, the Internet sweetheart stock. And for years, investors obeyed, focusing instead on Amazon's impressive revenue growth as a reason to pay dearly for the stock. The more money the company lost, the higher its stock seemed to go.
1999-10-28	Amazon Says Its Losses May Grow Next Quarter	Amazon.com, by far the biggest merchant on the Internet, reported yesterday that its losses in the third quarter were slightly less than analysts had expected. But the company also warned that it expected to lose far more than it had previously indicated in the fourth quarter, as it tripled its spending on marketing and advertising to compete vigorously this Christmas. That strategy indicates how quickly Amazon has moved from David to Goliath. When it started in 1995, it was an upstart bookseller taking on Barnes & Noble. Now it offers a wide range of merchandise, including electronics, and is host to auctions and storefronts for other merchants.
1999-10-23	Amazon Sues Big Bookseller Over System For Shopping	Amazon.com has filed suit against its rival Internet book and music seller Barnesandnoble.com, accusing it of illegally copying Amazon's patented checkout system and demanding an immediate end to its use. The suit, filed on Thursday night in Federal District Court in Seattle, is the latest chapter in a storied and sometimes litigious rivalry. But if Amazon.com is successful in the suit, it could have broad ramifications for the development of E-commerce.
1999-10-17	Foreign Affairs; Reality Bytes	Is this a story we will read sometime in the next year? NEW YORK (NYT) -- The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1,266 points today after Amazon.com announced that it had inadvertently made a profit.
1999-10-12	Reagan Book Enters Lists As Nonfiction	''Dutch,'' the biography of Ronald Reagan whose author, Edmund Morris, inserts a fictional version of himself in the narrative, jumped onto the best-seller lists this weekend -- in the nonfiction category. And, although there was little debate over how to classify the work, its unusual and heavily debated blending of fact and fiction did make some book review editors pause before including it in the nonfiction category.
1999-09-30	Amazon.com Plans A Transformation To Internet Bazaar	Amazon.com announced yesterday that it would transform itself into an Internet shopping bazaar, opening its popular Web site to merchants large and small for a minimal fee. In return, the selling powerhouse, which started as an on-line bookstore, will gather huge amounts of information on the buying habits of consumers. The initiative, called zShops, begins today with 500,000 new products -- about four times the offerings of the average Kmart -- the company said. Whether Amazon customers are really looking to buy everything from jam made by Trappist monks to white-water rescue equipment is yet to be proved.
1999-09-01	THE MARKETS: Market Place; Cutting Through Fog of Growth for Net Retailers	Financial reports from Internet retailers are like the pronouncements of the Delphic Priestess: future focused and infamously inscrutable. Traditional retailers, Sears and Wal-Mart among them, report changes in sales for stores open at least one year, providing analysts a way to evaluate whether growth is real or merely a construct of new stores. On-line merchants offer no such equivalent.
1999-08-30	Amazon Moves To Ease Worry About Privacy Of Customers	Amazon.com will adjust new 'personal circles' marketing tactic in response to critics who raised privacy concerns; says it will let customers request that their buying habits not be included in on-line lists of books and music popular with various groups of people (M)
1999-08-26	2 On-Line Retailers Split With Left Field	Left Field in San Francisco said yesterday that it had resigned two of its on-line accounts with estimated billings at $8 million: Amazon.com in Seattle and Drugstore.com in Bellevue, Wash. Spokesmen for both Amazon and Drugstore said the decisions to end their relationships with Left Field were mutual. The Amazon spokesman, Paul Capelli, said the account would be placed in review although a timetable for the decision had not been set. Amazon had worked with Left Field since 1996. The decision does not affect Amazon's relationship with its off-line advertiser, Foote, Cone & Belding Worldwide in Chicago, part of True North Communications.
1999-08-10	Times Co. and Amazon Settle a Legal Dispute	Amazon.com and The New York Times Company have settled their legal dispute over the on-line bookseller's use of the newspaper's weekly best-seller list to sell discounted books. The companies said in a statement yesterday that they had reached an agreement that would permit Amazon to continue publishing the list of popular titles. The dispute had prompted the bookseller to go to Federal court in June seeking a ruling that would allow it to continue to use the list.
1999-08-09	Northern Ireland Book's Allegations Stir International Libel Fight	Along the leafy lanes of County Armagh in Northern Ireland, the hostility over a television documentary and book about a secret ruling committee of Protestant terrorists has raged for eight years with the intensity of a popular local game played with heavy iron balls. The debate about allegations that such a committee existed divided Catholics and Protestants in Portadown, a County Armagh community so riven by violent sectarianism that it has been described by outsiders as Northern Ireland's Alabama.
1999-08-09	Internet Sale of Nazi Books in Germany Assailed	Contending that the two largest on-line booksellers are violating German laws against the distribution of hate literature, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has called on Barnesandnoble.com and Amazon.com to stop selling books like ''Mein Kampf'' to customers in Germany. In a letter this month to Germany's Minister of Justice, the Center, an educational group in Los Angeles that monitors anti-Semitism, wrote that ''the books ordered by Internet are sent directly to the homes of the customers, thereby circumventing the German laws.''
1999-07-23	A New Outlet For Indie Films	For moviemakers who can't find distribution for their work, a lifeline of sorts has been thrown by the on-line retailer Amazon.Com. Abide by a few regulations, and a film that might have played a festival or two but was never bought, or a student film, or a pick-up production financed by friend, parent and credit card could be just as available as ''Forrest Gump'' and ''Titanic.'' Amazon, which calls its new program Amazon.com Advantage for Video, began doing the same thing last year for unpublished books. Instructions for filmmakers interested in the program are provided at www.amazon.com/advantage. Basically, one submits a tape or disk for a review of production quality (too raw is not acceptable) and appropriateness of content for children. If the production is accepted (the process takes one to two weeks), Amazon will order a ''conservative number'' (usually between two and five copies) and store them in its warehouse. The title is then listed by genre with all the other movies.
1999-07-22	Investment in Webhire	Webhire Inc., which produces Internet software to assist in corporate recruiting and hiring, said this week that Softbank Capital Partners L.P. had agreed to invest $20 million in it and buy 1.67 million Webhire shares from Amazon.com Inc. The investments -- a total of about $31 million -- will give Softbank, the Internet investment arm of the Softbank Corporation, the Japanese software distributor, a 40 percent interest in Webhire, which is based in Lexington.
1999-07-22	2 Internet Companies Have Solid Quarter	Despite a slowdown in the growth of on-line use in the spring, two of the largest Internet companies reported results yesterday that largely confirmed analysts' expectations for the quarter ending on June 30. America Online, the dominant provider of Internet services for home users, earned $160 million, slightly ahead of expectations, as its advertising revenue grew briskly.
1999-07-13	Amazon.com Gets Into Two New Businesses	Moving to position itself as the Internet's first true department store, Amazon.com plans to introduce two new divisions today, one for consumer electronics and another for toys. Amazon has grown from just an on-line bookseller into the largest Internet retailer by far, with more than 10 million customers. In addition to books, Amazon already operates sections for music and videos, as well as an auction site. Analysts estimate its sales will exceed $1.3 billion this year.
1999-06-26	Time Warner-Viacom Book Deal Said to Be Near	In yet another sign of the pressure to merge that is reshaping the publishing industry, Time Warner Books and Viacom's Simon & Schuster are in serious talks to form a joint venture for their book operations covering such aspects as warehousing, marketing and sales. The venture would reduce operating costs and would provide the combined companies more leverage in negotiating terms with giant retailers like Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com, a person close to the discussions said.
1999-06-26	Amazon Selects A Top Executive	Amazon.com Inc., the Internet's largest retailer, named Joseph Galli, a former top executive at Black & Decker, as its first president and chief operating officer. Mr. Galli, 41, begins immediately and will report to the founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, 35. Mr. Galli was president of Black & Decker's global power tools and accessories unit, where he built up its successful DeWalt tool line, until resigning in April.
1999-06-17	Sotheby's and Amazon.com Strike a Deal to Sell on Line	Five months after announcing a $25 million plan to begin its own on-line auction business, Sotheby's has entered into an alliance with Amazon.com to begin selling art and collectibles later this year. The arrangement, announced yesterday, combines Amazon's on-line expertise and broad customer reach with Sotheby's reputation as an authority in the business of selling fine and decorative arts.
1999-06-16	Sotheby's and Amazon Join On Internet Auction Site	Five months after Sotheby's announced a $25 million initiative to begin its own on-line auction business, it has entered into an alliance with Amazon.com. The two will begin selling art and collectibles later this year. The arrangement merges Amazon's on-line expertise and broad customer reach with Sotheby's reputation as an authority in the business of selling fine and decorative arts. ''We are bringing to the table technology, customer service and an introduction to 10 million people,'' said Jeff Bezas, founder and chief executive officer of Amazon.com. ''One of the biggest problems in the on-line auction business is the ability to authenticate what we sell and that's something Sotheby's can help us do. There's no other partner out there that could help us build this.''
1999-06-05	Amazon Asks Court to Clear Use of Times Best-Seller Lists	The leading on-line bookseller, Amazon.com, sought a legal ruling in Federal court yesterday to allow it to continue posting the New York Times best-seller lists after the newspaper had demanded in a letter that the company stop publishing the lists in the absence of a licensing agreement. The legal action came as a price war over best sellers on the New York Times lists has engulfed the top on-line bookstores, including Borders.com and Barnesandnoble.com. All three booksellers are offering 50 percent discounts on more than 60 titles on the various best-seller lists of The Times, which the companies post on their Web sites.
1999-06-03	Book Retailer Ends Bid for Wholesaler	Facing a likely challenge from Federal antitrust officials, Barnes & Noble Inc., the nation's largest retailer of books, abandoned its plans today to acquire the Ingram Book Group, the nation's biggest book wholesaler, in a $600 million deal that had provoked widespread complaints from other booksellers, large and small. But the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that although the agency had compelling policy reasons for opposing the deal it was also concerned that Barnes & Noble might prevail in court if the company decided to press the matter. He said antitrust law on so-called vertical mergers -- those between companies and their suppliers or distributors -- does not generally favor the Government.
1999-05-24	Selling Backpacks on the Web Is Much Harder Than It Looks	Head south on Interstate 5 from downtown Seattle and you cannot miss the huge terra-cotta office tower that commands the horizon from a nearby peak. The structure is the new home of Amazon.com, the ever-expanding Internet retailer that most other Internet retailers worship and strive to emulate. The Amazon creed is to break the budget on acquiring new customers -- on the theory that big profits will come later, once the company's name is established and the Web's lower operating costs make it impossible for brick-and-mortar competitors to keep up.
1999-05-18	3 On-Line Book Retailers Cut Prices on Best Sellers	In an escalating battle of the books, Amazon.com Inc., the on-line retailer, cut the prices on best-selling books by 50 percent yesterday, a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com, all of whom will almost certainly lose money on the bargain sales. Amazon's price-cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for its No. 2 rival, Barnes & Noble Inc., which has plans for a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks. But a company spokesman for Amazon.com in Seattle said the timing of its discounts on books from the New York Times best-seller lists was a matter of coincidence.
1999-05-12	Marketing Hall To Induct Two	Hallmark Cards Inc. in Kansas City, Mo., and Amazon.com in Seattle are being named to the Marketing Hall of Fame by the New York chapter of the American Marketing Association. They will be honored June 10 at the annual ceremony presenting the Effie Awards, which recognize effectiveness in advertising.
1999-04-10	One City, 2 Booksellers and a Bit of Bad Blood	Seattle has long prided itself on being an unusually literary city, where writers congregate and the drizzly climate often begs a resident to curl up in a chair and read. At its bookish heart, most Seattleites would agree, is the Elliott Bay Book Company, where customers can browse amid the cedar shelves or listen to some of the 500 or more programs annually that make up its pioneering series of author readings. Seattle also views itself with pride as one of the world's most technologically precocious cities, a natural place for a young man named Jeffrey P. Bezos to launch his Internet company, Amazon.com, which pioneered the concept of selling books through the World Wide Web.
1999-04-06	Wal-Mart Agrees to Settle Lawsuit Against Amazon	Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the giant retailer, has agreed to settle a lawsuit against Amazon.com that had accused the company, the No. 1 Internet bookseller, of having raided Wal-Mart's workers to learn about its computer system, the companies said today The settlement calls for Amazon and Drugstore.com, the on-line drug seller in which Amazon owns a 46 percent interest, to reassign former Wal-Mart executives and consultants to jobs that do not involve their expertise with Wal-Mart's computer merchandising system, according to a statement issued jointly by the companies. No money is being paid under the settlement, it said.
1999-04-04	Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazon.com	As the author of a new book, I am among those with warm feelings toward Amazon.com. My book received strong, initial reviews. But my publisher is a small house, with limited funds for marketing. When people ask where they can find my book, you bet I send them to Amazon. If that makes me a ''bovine missionary,'' so be it. Maureen Korp Ottawa, Canada
1999-04-04	Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazon.com	Peter de Jonge's article (March 14) left me in awe not only of Amazon.com's organizational acumen but also of its ability to round up investors, despite its constant losses. While the article mentioned Amazon's annual sales and how many credit-card numbers it has on file, I would be curious to find out the size of its average order. It's one thing to be ''customer-obsessed'' when you're selling big-ticket items. It's quite another when the sale involved will gross the equivalent of dinner for two at Wendy's. Although you might think that a sale is a sale, as the owner of a tiny mail-order business I've found invariably that our most demanding, time-wasting customers are our smallest. Joe Eckstein Canaan, N.Y
1999-04-04	Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazon.com	Amazon.com seems admirably focused on customer service at this early point in its existence, perhaps believing, like Nordstrom, that satisfied customers are the building blocks of every successful enterprise. The only gripe de Jonge seems to have is that the stock price has risen too fast. Robert Tad Seder Seattle
1999-04-04	Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazon.com	Even if Jeff Bezos doesn't fulfill his goal of branding Amazon.com as the one-stop shop for everything, his company will be known as one of the first paved roads in the jungle of the Internet. Jonathan Bennett Flushing, N.Y.
1999-04-04	Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazon.com	Let's not forget the value of casual interactions with our actual neighbors. Amazon.com encourages us to stay inside and surf the Net, rather than explore the world outside our offices and homes. By booting up and logging on, we limit our possibilities instead of creating them. Elizabeth Grainger New York
1999-03-30	The Next Trick for Amazon.com: Auctions	Furthering its audacious ambition to be involved virtually any time anyone sells anything on the Internet, Amazon.com plans to let individuals and small businesses conduct auctions on its popular World Wide Web site. The company plans to begin offering the auction capability today from its existing Web site. Shares of Amazon.com rose nearly 8 percent yesterday, closing at $149.625, up $10.5625 in Nasdaq trading, following the company's announcement of the plan late Sunday.
1999-03-29	Compressed Data; Big and Small Booksellers Take Battle on Line	Ever since the first mega-bookstore rolled into the suburban strip mall, small independent booksellers have cried foul, accusing the chains of big-foot practices. Now the wailing can be heard in cyberspace. The independents are rankled over advertising deals that Internet search engines like Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Hotbot, which is a unit of Wired Digital, and Alta Vista have forged with the two biggest on-line bookstores -- Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com, a joint venture of Barnes & Noble and Bertelsmann.
1999-03-21	Another Way to Win With Amazon.com Stock	Soaring Internet stocks may be hard to puncture in the marketplace. But that doesn't mean they can't be deflated on the Web. Global Investor Bookshop, a British on-line bookstore specializing in financial publications, is trying to do just that with a new Internet competition tilting at its much bigger rival, Amazon.com. Entrants are asked to guess the stock price of Amazon.com on April 30, 1999; the prizes include a ride in a hot-air balloon, champagne breakfast included. Of course, there's keen David-and-Goliath competition at play.
1999-03-15	Independent Booksellers Plan to Open On-Line Store	Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national on-line store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. The on-line venture, which is scheduled to open for business this summer, is the most ambitious element in a series of countermeasures to promote independent bookstores by the American Booksellers Association, the dominant trade group for a beleaguered fraternity that has seen its share of the popular consumer book market shrink to about 17 percent today from 32 percent in 1991.

1999-03-13	On the Internet, Bigger Is Better	To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman's March 9 column, his second in two weeks on Lyle Bowlin, implies that anyone can compete against the big companies using the Internet. Well, yes, especially if he or she can get a columnist of The Times to provide free publicity.
1999-03-13	On the Internet, Bigger Is Better	To the Editor: Re ''KillingGoliath.com'' (column, March 9): While I agree that bigger is not necessarily better, in fact bigger can sometimes be personal.
1999-03-13	On the Internet, Bigger Is Better	To the Editor: Re ''KillingGoliath.com'' (column, March 9): While I agree that bigger is not necessarily better, in fact bigger can sometimes be personal.
1999-03-09	Foreign Affairs; KillingGoliath.com	I recently wrote a column about Lyle Bowlin, who, for about $150 a month, had managed to put together a Web site that could compete with Amazon.com for selling books. Mr. Bowlin was underselling Ama zon.com (and making a profit!) while running the whole operation out of a spare bedroom in his home in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Well, the column elicited the usual range of skeptical responses from experts, who argued that Mr. Bowlin's operation was just a fluke, or that he wasn't calculating his costs properly, or that Amazon.com would soon crush him and all other would-be little-guy competitors. Well, to all of you I say: YOU'RE WRONG.
1999-03-03	Mom and Pop on the Net	To the Editor: I'm sure that many thought Thomas L. Friedman (column, Feb. 26) was mistaken to liken a small-time entrepreneur's home Internet bookselling business to Amazon.com. How could this guy ever be as big as Amazon.com? Mr. Friedman is right; the naysayers are wrong. Lyle Bowlin's Internet bookstore may never be as big as Amazon.com, but that doesn't matter! Equating a business's size with success is an anachronistic holdover from a marketplace driven by the economies of scale created by mass manufacturing and mass marketing. When it comes to return on investment, bigger isn't better anymore.
1999-03-03	Mom and Pop on the Net	To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman (column, Feb. 26) may be right that the bookseller Amazon.com is vulnerable to competition from kitchen-table start-ups. But the example he cites doesn't prove that. He figures that Lyle Bowlin's profit on the sale of one copy of ''The Testament'' at $3.65 by subtracting the wholesale cost of the book ($15.64) plus postage ($1.63) from revenue ($20.92). The problem is that these are not the only costs incurred. The most important of the omitted costs is labor. While Mr. Bowlin does not pay himself, his wife or his daughter any wages, the time they put in is nonetheless valuable, because it could be put to other uses.
1999-03-02	Amazon.com Site Tells Users Of Book Promotion Payments	Responding to complaints from customers, Amazon.com retooled its popular on-line bookstore yesterday so that it would disclose when publishers pay money to subsidize titles that are highlighted or featured with favorable reviews. The Seattle-based company used a note on its home page to invite readers to ''learn about co-op placements,'' the jargon of the publishing industry for advertising payments made to bookstore chains or large independent stores to feature titles in prominent sites in stores.
1999-02-26	Foreign Affairs; Amazon.you	Testifying before Congress Tuesday, Alan Greenspan wouldn't exactly come out and say that there was a little irrational exuberance behind some of the Internet stocks, but he said these share prices had reached levels that gave him ''concerns.'' Well, if you really want to be ''concerned'' about the levels of some of these profitless Internet stocks, such as Amazon.com, you should pay less attention to Mr. Greenspan and more attention to what's going on in a small house in Cedar Falls, Iowa.
1999-02-25	Amazon.com Moving Into Drug and Cosmetic Retailing	Does Internet surfing give you a headache? Now a new site, backed by Amazon.com, wants to sell you aspirin along with prescription drugs and other over-the-counter health and beauty products. After establishing itself as the most successful bookstore on the World Wide Web, Amazon has been moving quickly to become a full service electronic mall. It offers music and videos itself, and its new ''shop the Web'' service offers links to dozens of other on-line merchants.
1999-02-21	Playing Catch-Up at the On-Line Mall	FROM a public relations standpoint, the decision by Victoria's Secret to put its annual Manhattan fashion show on its new Internet site early this month was an unqualified master stroke. Three days after a high-profile Super Bowl commercial invited the world to tune in, the lingerie retailer offered up its parade of semiclothed seductresses, live on the Web. A record 750,000 users viewed the event the evening it occurred and millions more heard about it through media coverage. The perspective from cyberspace, however, was a good deal less beguiling. Like many other Internet aficionados, Jakob Nielsen, a site design expert and publisher in Atherton, Calif., considered the event a disappointment, a missed opportunity to exploit an expansive new medium. Never mind that it took forever to get access to the pictures, which seemed grainy enough to have been beamed back from an Apollo space mission. The real shame, Mr. Nielsen said, was the retailer's failure to use its models in a fashion show that was interactive -- ''where visitors asked questions and learned about fabrics and prices.''
1999-02-18	GEOWORKS SHARES RISE 56% AFTER AMAZON BUYS 7% STAKE	Shares of the Geoworks Corporation surged 56 percent after the maker of cellular phones and other wireless products said that Amazon.com Inc. had bought a 7 percent stake in it for $5 million. Geoworks shares rose $1.875, to $5.25, in trading of 17.8 million, making it the seventh most actively traded stock in United States markets. Amazon.com dropped $5.125, to $93.50.
1999-02-08	For Sale: On-Line Bookstore's Recommendations	The E-commerce pioneer Amazon.com strives for a clean look for its on-line bookstore. That is why executives consider it unnecessary to clutter its World Wide Web pages and pithy book recommendations with notices that publishers are starting to pay to have titles featured as ''New and Notable'' or ''Destined for Greatness.'' The rapidly growing company began charging publishers modest fees last summer in a limited experiment. But this year, Amazon increased the offerings to publishers so that now $10,000 is the price tag for a premium package for a newly released computer book -- consideration that includes the top slot on the computer home page, an author profile or interview and ''complete Amazon.com editorial review treatment.''
1999-01-27	Amazon.com Loss Less Than Expected	Amazon.com Inc. said today that its fourth-quarter loss widened less than expected, while sales almost quadrupled, to $252.9 million, as more holiday shoppers used it to buy gifts. The No. 1 on-line book retailer lost $22.2 million, or 14 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of $10.8 million, or 8 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales climbed to $252.9 million from $66 million.
1999-01-15	Foreign Affairs; We're All One River	There are some who will tell you that 1999 will be remembered as the year of Clinton, Starr and Lewinsky. Wrong. This remarkable year will be remembered a decade from now as the year of the Amazon -- the cyber-river and the real river, Ama zon.com and Amazon.country, also known as Brazil. Those two rivers are flip sides of the same coin, and the coin is globalization. The incredible run-up in the stock price of Amazon.com and the incredible run-down in the stock markets of Amazon.country, i.e., Brazil, are both reflections of investors trying to figure out what companies and countries will be worth in this new era of globalization.
1999-01-11	Amazon Surge May Reflect The New Math Of the Internet	For Amazon.com, the best seller that really mattered last week was not a book title, but the company's stock. Whether it was simply more Internet frenzy, or a further sign that on-line commerce may require its own investment calculus, the company's shares had a remarkable run last week. Amazon.com, an Internet bookseller which has yet to report a profitable quarter since going public in May 1997, saw its share price soar by nearly 50 percent in the first trading week of the new year. Since the beginning of December, the stock price has climbed about 150 percent.
1999-01-08	Amazon.com Is Adding A Warehouse	Amazon.com, the E-commerce pioneer whose stock price keeps soaring even though it has yet to make a profit, announced yesterday that it had leased a huge, highly mechanized warehouse near Reno, a sign that it intends to expand its own distribution system for the books, music CD's and videos it sells. The warehouse, formerly owned by Stanley Works, should help Amazon.com increase its operating margins, several analysts said, by capturing profits at both the retail and distribution levels.
1999-01-01	2 Peoples Separated By Ocean, Not by Borders	The Borders bookstore version of the Tower of London stands four stories tall, with such vast space devoted to words, chilled chardonnay and house blend coffee that at least one British author felt the acute need to retreat to the new gleaming restrooms for refuge from a panic attack. The superstore, on the eastern side of London's busiest shopping district on Oxford Street, is part of the grand strategy of Borders Group to expand its reach outside of the United States, a feat no other major bookseller in the world has tried.
1998-12-23	Where a Fingertip Click Meets the Elbow Grease	For the on-line shopper at Amazon.com, it all looks so easy this holiday season. ''Easy for the customer, sure,'' said Todd Bradley, a 27-year-old cart runner threading through the maze of shelves at the company's vast distribution center here. ''You just kick back at home and wait.'' Cedric Ross, 29, the training manager, added: ''There's nothing virtual about it for us. We've got books to get out the door here.''
1998-12-08	On-Line Booksellers: A Tale of Two C.E.O.'s	HERE is a great war story. On one side is Amazon.com, the giant on-line bookseller (market value $5.5 billion), led by its 35-year-old Seattle-based founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos. On the other side is Barnesandnoble.com, the small but aggressive No. 2 with the brand name and a very rich partner (Bertelsmann A.G.), led by our subject today, Jonathan Bulkeley. Mr. Bulkeley, 38, who started America Online's British operation, was hired last month in an attempt to make Mr. Bezos as miserable as possible. He starts Jan. 4 at the new Barnesandnoble.com headquarters on Ninth Avenue at 15th Street, in a Port Authority warehouse renovated into a post-modern lair of exposed computer cables and sleek cement floors.
1998-12-08	Microsoft and Barnes & Noble Join Forces	In a deal that may prove damaging to the Internet's largest bookseller, Amazon.com, the Microsoft Corporation and Barnes & Noble Inc. said yesterday that they had agreed to weave together their on-line products and services. The marketing arrangement makes Barnes & Noble the exclusive bookseller on Microsoft's popular MSN network.
1998-12-07	Amazon Is Reported Ready To Link to Other Merchants	Amazon.com, the rapidly expanding on-line store, is about to introduce a new service in which it will refer its customers to other Internet merchants selling goods that it does not carry, according to people briefed by the company on the plan. Amazon.com plans to place links marked ''Shop the Web'' throughout its on-line store early next week, these people said. This will allow consumers to search for items in a number of categories including apparel, toys, computers and travel. Such a search would display items from a selection of participating vendors. The vendors include some mainstream merchants, like L. L. Bean, the Gap and F. A. O. Schwarz, as well as some Internet-only merchants like Brainplay.com, a high-end Internet toy store.
1998-11-18	Once Upon a Frenzy; Book Industry in Big Shift Focused on Product Delivery	The flat, sprawling warehouses of Nashville are leagues away from a Manhattan literary lunch and repartee with a prominent author, but this prosaic side of the nation's $8 billion consumer book market -- packing, shipping and delivery -- has become a key to its future. With the industry roiled by consolidation and the growth of Internet bookstores, gentle readers are now the focus of a frantic effort to deliver them the literary equivalent of steaming Big Macs: fast, cheap and wrapped to go.
1998-11-17	Amazon Stretching Beyond Its Roots in Books	Amazon.com, the on-line retailer that already dominates the Internet sales of books and, increasingly, music, is about to start offering a much broader array of merchandise. The Seattle-based company's first step into general retailing will be a holiday gift selection starting today that will feature consumer electronics, games, toys and other items. Separately, the company is adding an extensive line of videotapes and DVD's (digital videodisks).
1998-11-09	Bookstore Goliaths Fax to the Finish	Bookselling heavyweights are reaching for their slingshots and bon mots. After Barnes & Noble's announcement Friday of its $600 million purchase of the country's leading book wholesaler, the Ingram Book Company, its fierce rival, Amazon.com responded with a short statement that started a duel of news releases.
1998-10-29	Amazon Says Sales Soared As Quarterly Loss Narrowed	Amazon.com Inc., the leading on-line bookseller, yesterday reported a quadrupling of sales and a narrower-than-expected third-quarter loss. Amazon said it also became the leading on-line music retailer in the quarter, with sales of $14.4 million.
1998-10-11	Beyond Books, but Sticking to the Basics	Is Amazon.com changing from the darling of the Internet to a nascent evil empire? Jeffrey P. Bezos was one of the first people to see the power of the Internet to create a turbocharged kind of catalogue retailing. So he left D. E. Shaw & Company, one of Wall Street's most sophisticated computerized trading firms, to start Amazon. From a list of 100 types of merchandise to sell, he chose books, because he believed bookselling would best show off the Internet's ability to let people find what they are looking for.
1998-10-08	Amazon Ponders Effects Of Rivals' Planned Mergers	If the stock market is to be believed -- and that's rarely a good bet -- the prospect of mergers among on-line merchants in both books and music is dire news for Amazon.com Inc., the most popular store on the Internet. But in many ways, the prospect of two on-line deals represent an acknowledgment of just how strong a market position Amazon.com holds.
1998-10-08	A Contemporary Bookstore	WWW.MOSAICBOOKS.COM THIS literary site, could, at first glance, pass for the black Amazon.com of the Internet, and it is in fact an associate of the Amazon site. Here you can find books -- albeit a limited number -- by black and Hispanic authors. There are descriptions and prices for some of the latest fiction by black authors, like ''Milk in My Coffee'' by Eric Jerome Dickey, about an interracial relationship, and the ''The Store of a Million Items: Stories'' by Michelle Cliff, about the author's Caribbean-American heritage.
1998-10-07	2 Book Giants In Global Deal To Sell Titles Via Internet	Two giants in the business of books struck a $200 million deal today to become partners in a global network to sell titles in all major languages on line, posing a powerful competitive threat to the electronic commerce pioneer Amazon.com. Barnes & Noble, the largest bookstore chain in the United States, and Bertelsmann A.G., the German media conglomerate, announced the plans for a joint venture involving the American chain's unprofitable electronic subsidiary, Barnesandnoble.com.
1998-09-16	Writers' Consolation	To the Editor: I was pleased to see that Alberto Manguel's ''Writers' Wish List'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 8), on the technological consolations for the slow-selling author, ended with Mr. Manguel's turning back to Thomas Love Peacock and a less mechanical way of coping.
1998-09-08	The Writers' Wish List	On June 3, 1997, a group of literary aficionados gathered in the Reading Room of the British Library in London to welcome the arrival of Enoch Soames, a fictional poet in a short story by the English humorist Max Beerbohm. Perhaps not unexpectedly, he didn't appear. What prompted the gathering was this: In Beerbohm's story, set in 1897, Soames, who has sold only three copies of his book of poems, ''Fungoids,'' makes a pact with the Devil. In exchange for his ambitious soul, he asks to visit the Reading Room a hundred years hence, to see how posterity had judged him.
1998-08-23	Books Did It for Amazon, but What's Next?	MANY an eye, on Wall Street and Main Street alike, is trained on the Internet, seeking signs that its much-hyped promise as a channel of retail commerce is beginning to be realized. The big breakthrough so far, the bookseller Amazon.com, demonstrated that ordinary products not composed of chips and bits can be successfully retailed over the Internet. And, perhaps more important, it showed that investors see no need to wait for consistent operating profits before betting heavily on a company that may have found the key.
1998-08-21	Barnes & Noble Web Unit to Go Public	With competition intensifying among electronic booksellers, Barnes & Noble Inc. announced yesterday that it would sell shares to the public of its money-losing on-line venture, which trails in sales behind the pioneering leader, Amazon.com. Barnes & Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, intends to sell 20 percent of the on-line venture, Barnesandnoble.com, which generated $14 million in sales last year in contrast to Amazon's $147.8 million. The initial public offering could take place in the next 30 days, the company said.
1998-08-05	Amazon.com Is Expanding Beyond Books	In a move indicating that its aspirations extend to selling far more than books over the Internet, Amazon.com said yesterday that it had bought the Junglee Corporation, which operates a service that lets people shop for everything from clothing to computers. Separately, Amazon.com also bought Planet All, which operates a vast Internet address service that allows people to stay in touch with their friends and associates. Amazon.com hopes to sell books and its expanding variety of goods to Planet All's 1.5 million members.
1998-08-03	Compressed Data; Amazon.com Program Signs Member No. 100,000	Amazon.com has enrolled 100,000th Web site for Amazon.com Associates Program, affiliate network that pays commission of up to 15 percent for each sale referred from site; members simply recommend titles at their sites and establish links that enable direct purchases from Amazon.com; drawing (S)
1998-07-19	Does Amazon = 2 Barnes & Nobles?	IMAGINE two companies in the same business. The sales of Company A are one-nineteenth those of Company B. Company A has never shown a profit and is expected to report on Wednesday even bigger losses than had been forecast, while Company B is enjoying a strong quarter and figures to be solidly profitable for the third consecutive year. Company B's market capitalization ought to dwarf Company A's, yes? And investors ought to be piling into Company B and watching Company A nervously, right?

Which one gives the best party?
1997-10-22	Two Booksellers Settle Lawsuits	Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com have settled lawsuits against each other concerning sales of books on the Internet, the companies said yesterday. The rival booksellers said that neither party admitted wrongdoing of any kind, and neither paid damages. The companies said they ''simply decided that they would rather compete in the marketplace than in the courtroom.''
1997-09-13	Whodunit and Who Wunit: The Plot Quickens	Whodunit? William Evermore, Franklin Boyce or Uncle James Polk? Or Miss Tasso Polk herself? Or Colonel Mustard? Or was it John Updike? No one knows, least of all the reader who gets to the end of ''Murder Makes the Magazine,'' the serial murder mystery concocted by Mr. Updike and 44 co-authors on the Internet. The Amazon.com contest to help Mr. Updike write a mystery and win a grand prize of $100,000 ended yesterday. The winner, to be chosen at random from more than 360,000 applicants, will be announced Tuesday, and it may, or may not, be one of the authors (with the exception of Mr. Updike, who has to be satisfied with a fee of an undisclosed amount). Each week for six weeks, a preliminary winner was chosen and received $1,000. The end of the story was supplied yesterday by Mr. Updike. There are no plans to publish the mystery, but readers can call it up on www.amazon.com, which happens to be a bookselling Web site.
1997-08-28	CUC REDUCES PRICES FOR BOOKS MEMBERS BUY ON LINE	CUC International Inc.'s on-line book unit disclosed price cuts yesterday aimed at stealing market share from Amazon.com Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc. in the fledgling industry of electronic book selling. CUC's Book Stacks Unlimited said it would increase discounts to 40 percent off the suggested retail price for hardcover books and 30 percent off for paperbacks. The discounts apply to members of Net Market, CUC's electronic shopping site, and to members of the Frequent Buyer Club of Book Stacks. Shares of CUC fell 37.5 cents, to $24.375, while Amazon.com stock dropped 31.25 cents, to $27.8125. Barnes & Noble stock fell $1.875, to $45.625.
1997-08-02	John Updike, Impresario Of Fictional Relay Race	Remember Snoopy sitting on top of his doghouse and slowly typing, ''It was a dark and stormy night''? Now think of John Updike, breezing in from the golf course to write, ''Miss Tasso Polk at ten-ten alighted from the elevator onto the olive tiles of the nineteenth floor only lightly nagged by a sense of something wrong. The Magazine's crest, that great black M, the thing masculine that had most profoundly penetrated her life, echoed from its inlaid security the thoughtful humming in her mind: 'm.' '' This is the beginning of a new short story, a mystery entitled ''Murder Makes the Magazine,'' which as yet has no middle or ending but will eventually have 44 authors in addition to Mr. Updike. In a contest that is part lottery, part chain letter, Amazon.com, the on-line bookseller, is asking imitation Updikes to continue the story with one or more sentences, with the conclusion to be written by the eminent novelist, himself. Every day a winner will be chosen and awarded $1,000. At the end of the competition in September, a Grand Prize of $100,000 will be given to one of the contestants, in a random drawing from all eligible entries. Unabashedly, Amazon calls the multiplex mystery ''The Greatest Tale Ever Told.''
1997-05-16	AMAZON.COM STOCK RISES 30% AFTER PUBLIC OFFERING	Amazon.com Inc.'s newly public stock began trading yesterday nearly $12 higher than its offering price as investors chased after one of the hottest offerings this year. Amazon.com stock was priced Wednesday night at $18 a share and it opened yesterday at $29.15 on the Nasdaq stock market. After climbing as high as $30 a share, it retreated and finished at $23.50, up 30.5 percent. Amazon.com, an Internet bookseller, has said that it sold $16 million worth of books in 1996 to 180,000 customers in 100 countries. Average daily visits to the company's Web site rose to 50,000 in December 1996 from 2,200 in December 1995.

1997-04-26	Books and Company on East Side to Close Down	The Whitney Museum of American Art, acting as landlord, yesterday rejected a last-minute effort to save Books and Company, sealing the fate of the Upper East Side bookstore that some New York intellectuals consider the city's best because of its eclectic offerings and home-away-from-home atmosphere. The decision followed an 11th-hour proposal by two anonymous admirers of the 20-year-old bookstore to help its owners pay the increased rent.

The offering will include 375,000 additional shares to cover unexpected demand for the stock, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1997-03-24	Web Book Giant Fighting Off Competitors	Amazon.com, the leading bookstore in cyberspace, has turned to see some big book names paddling in pursuit. As giants of the shelf-and-counter book world dive into the World Wide Web, Amazon.com Inc., which may be the most successful business of any kind on the Internet, has mounted a pre-emptive strike against the not-so-callow upstarts.
