6/1/2010	Arts, Briefly: Carly Simon vs. Starbucks: Round 2	Like a dedicated Starbucks patron on her fourth cup of Organic Yukon Blend, Carly Simon won't rest yet in her legal pursuits against that coffee company, The Hollywood Reporter said. In October Ms. Simon sued Starbucks, saying it promised to distribute her 2008 album, ''This Kind of Love,'' at its stores, then withdrew from its Hear Music retail project days before the album's release. That lawsuit was thrown out of United States District Court in Los Angeles on a summary judgment in April when a judge said Ms. Simon had failed to show that Starbucks made fraudulent misrepresentations or concealed facts to mislead her. But in an amended complaint, Ms. Simon cites assurances that she said she had received from Alan Mintz, vice president of content development at Starbucks, that the company would promote and distribute her album aggressively, as well as her contract with Hear Music and the album's proposed marketing plan. In its response, Starbucks said it did not make any agreements with the intent to deceive Ms. Simon. The Hollywood Reporter said a ruling on whether the case would proceed was expected soon.

3/28/2010	Crossfire	Starbucks has lately found itself in the middle of a debate between advocates of ''open carry'' gun rights and of gun control; the former have held armed meet-ups at several of its locations, and the latter have demanded that the coffee chain prevent this from happening. Seeking to duck these fresh salvos in the long debate over how firearms fit into American life, the company has issued a statement that such matters ought to be worked out ''in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores.'' Well, sure. But drawing a line between official institutions of lawmaking and the daily sphere where citizens move about is not so easy. And one thing the pistols-and-Frappuccino moment has demonstrated is that this is acutely true for a business with an image carefully devised to blur the line between public space and commercial space. Fans of more-expansive interpretations of the Second Amendment see it as their right to bear arms while going about their routine business, which usually means carrying a concealed weapon. It also turns out that a surprising number of states grant the right to carry an unconcealed weapon. The catch is that private businesses are often allowed to ban guns from their premises, making it difficult, as a practical matter, to run errands while outfitted like Wyatt Earp on the way to the O.K. Corral. Starbucks, as it happens, does not impose such rules in its many thousand square feet of space in states that happen to have open-carry laws. The meet-ups seemed calculated to inspire a showdown, and that's what happened. Peet's and California Pizza Kitchen were also picked as meet-up spots by the open-carry crowd in the San Francisco Bay Area, and these companies responded by promptly instituting no-gun rules. When Starbucks demurred, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence organized an online petition inviting you to ''Tell Starbucks: 'Keep Guns Out.' ''

12/6/2006	Calorie Shock at the Counter	New York Citys Board of Health approved a requirement Tuesday that fast-food restaurants post the calories in their offerings in large type and in readily visible positions, which might well yield more important health dividends than the trans fats ban.
11/17/2006	Starbucks Posts 5% Drop in Fourth-Quarter Profit	Starbucks said its fourth-quarter profit slipped 5 percent, blaming the dip on new accounting changes.

10/29/2006	Letters: Starbucks, Yiddish Penzance	STARBUCKS.
10/29/2006	Coffee Talk	To the Editor: It's fine that Starbucks is expanding its ''good taste'' beyond coffee (''The Starbucks Aesthetic'' by Susan Dominus, Oct. 22), but hopefully it will dare to go beyond safe choices and, in the tradition of the original English coffeehouses, which the king tried to close because they stimulated too much thought, make choices that provoke discussion of art, culture and politics. Tom Miller Oakland
10/29/2006	Fast-Food Culture	To the Editor: Starbucks also promotes another culture: one where there's no escape from the noise of strangers barking into their cellphones as they discuss spreadsheets or domestic inanities. They're loud enough to be heard above the volume of the chain's XM radio station, which plays sleepy oldies to encourage greater coffee sales. And to further degrade the faux-bohemian ''cafe experience,'' just a few weeks ago its stores here started selling ''breakfast in a sandwich'' cuisine, in line with its rapidly approaching destiny: McDonald's.

5/1/2006	A Small Step at Starbucks From Mocha to Movies	Starbucks is seeking movies and books to promote in the hope of duplicating the success it has had selling and promoting music.
4/23/2006	To Hire Sharp Employees, Recruit in Sharp Ways	JASON S. WARNER limits himself to one cup of coffee a day -- admirable self-control, considering where he works and the rigors of his job. Mr. Warner, director of North American recruiting for the Starbucks Corporation, is contending with a hiring boom spurred by one of the most ambitious growth stories in retailing. Starbucks, with more than 11,000 stores and roughly 120,000 employees worldwide, plans to open 1,800 stores this year, after opening 1,700 last year. The long-term goal is 30,000 around the world, including 15,000 in the United States alone.
4/23/2006	China Wins Over Washington, But D.C. Proves a Bit Tougher	IF President Hu Jintao thought all Americans held the same opinion of China, the notion was surely dispelled last week during his visits to the nation's two Washingtons. In Washington the state, Mr. Hu beamed as he hobnobbed with the capitalist kings of computers, coffee shops and airplanes, who are among those making a mint in China's markets.
4/16/2006	Late-Night Refuge, Complete With Refills	LIZZIE, a chubby woman with windburned cheeks and some teeth missing, takes a seat at her usual table at the Starbucks on Astor Place. It's the one closest to the door, where there is room for her leather purse, her canvas bag, her backpack, her rollaway suitcase and the wheelchair she uses to cart around her winter wardrobe. Lizzie, who says she doesn't give her last name because her lawyer told her not to, drinks a venti-size coffee that she gets for the refill price of 54 cents and uses a highlighter to mark up a nonfiction paperback she bought at the Strand for 52 cents. She has been going to this Starbucks for six months, ever since someone told her it was open late. In doing so, she joined the other homeless regulars who are putting off the start of a long night on the subway by hanging out there.
2/26/2006	Big Gulp	Ethos Water Ethos Water comes in a tasteful bottle with a bold claim on the front: ''Helping children get clean water.'' This refers to the fact that 5 cents of every $1.80 (or so) bottle purchased is put toward water projects in underdeveloped regions. The target is the consumer with a conscience. ''One of the best questions we get from consumers is, How do I do more?'' says Jonathan Greenblatt, a founder. ''That's exactly what we want to hear.'' Last year, Ethos was bought by Starbucks, which touted the purchase as an important addition to its corporate social-responsibility efforts. To Greenblatt, this speaks volumes about what consumers want from companies these days: ''It's about being part of the global community and making a difference and enabling those consumers who want to, quote-unquote, do more.''
1/19/2006	Establishing Some Ground Rules	THE coffee situation at my house got out of control gradually. Somehow my husband and I have become the sort of full-blown extremists who argue over the finer points of milk-steaming techniques and who polish the chrome on our ridiculously shiny espresso maker as lovingly as firefighters buff a fancy new hook-and-ladder.
1/13/2006	Starbucks to Add Movie Products	The Starbucks Corporation said yesterday that it would begin promoting movies and selling DVD's and soundtracks at its coffee shops to expand its entertainment offerings. The first movie promotion at Starbucks will be ''Akeelah and the Bee,'' a film about a spelling bee, produced by Lions Gate and starring Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett, to be released in April. Starbucks will have spelling-related trivia games in its stores and promotions for the movie on its cardboard cup sleeves.
12/2/2005	Corrections	An article on Saturday about efforts by Starbucks workers in New York to form a citywide union referred imprecisely to three Starbucks coffee shops where organizing has taken place. Although some workers at the three shops have joined the union, no Starbucks shops are unionized. The article also misstated the minimum number of hours required per workweek to qualify for health benefits. It is 20, not 30. A picture caption with the article misstated the union's name. It is the Industrial Workers of the World, not International.
11/26/2005	Union Steps Up Drive to Organize Starbucks	The conflict between the Starbucks coffee chain and workers wanting to form a citywide union played out on two fronts yesterday: organizers formed a picket line in front of a local Starbucks, and a hearing was announced for next year before the National Labor Relations Board. Chanting, ''No latte, no peace,'' as a union organizer dressed as a giant latte rocked back and forth, about 20 demonstrators picketed a Starbucks at Union Square.
11/21/2005	PepsiCo-Starbucks Venture Selects Goodby, Silverstein	The North American Coffee Partnership, a joint venture of the Starbucks Corporation and the Pepsi-Cola North America unit of PepsiCo, has named Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco to create campaigns for ready-to-drink beverages like Starbucks Frappucino and Starbucks DoubleShot. Spending was estimated at $20 million. The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Goodby, Silverstein, part of the Omnicom Group, and the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty. The review was prompted by a recent decision by Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe, to close its New York office, which had worked for the partnership.
10/23/2005	IDEAS & TRENDS: Commerce; How Breweth Java With Jesus	STARBUCKS coffee cups will soon be emblazoned with a religious quotation from Rick Warren, the best-selling author and pastor, which includes the line, ''You were made by God and for God, and until you understand that, life will never make sense.'' Meanwhile, hipster havens like Urban Outfitters have made a mint selling T-shirts declaring ''Jesus Is My Homeboy.'' Alaska Airlines distributes cards quoting Bible verses, and at least 100 cities now have phone directories for Christian businesses.
10/23/2005	Cappucino to Cafe Americano	For more than a decade, the Italian pop/blues musician known as Zucchero has been a star in his native Italy and in neighboring countries. He has released 11 albums, and he has recorded with rock luminaries including Bono, Sting and Eric Clapton. But none of that won him an audience on these shores. He had a small fan base in the United States, and his label, Universal Music Italy, had released albums here, but they never sold many copies. ''I was saying to myself, forget America already,'' Zucchero said in an interview at his home, a rustic farm in Tuscany.
10/12/2005	He Doesn't Make Coffee, but He Controls 'Starbucks' in Russia	Sergei A. Zuykov is a lawyer for Starbucks in Russia. Only the Starbucks he represents brews no coffee and owns no shops. Its business consists of trying to sell its name back to the other Starbucks -- the better-known company from Seattle. A tall, strapping 39-year-old former car alarm salesman turned trademark squatter, Mr. Zuykov has stalled Starbucks' entry into one of the fastest growing retail markets in Europe while competitors, both homegrown and international brands, have been springing up like mushrooms after the rain.
10/1/2005	Return of the Junk Fax	IN the hierarchy of annoying advertisers, the porn spammers and the pump-and-dump stock promoters dwell at the bottom. Not far above them are junk faxers, who spew unsolicited advertisements to your fax machine, using your phone line, your ink and your paper in the process. Most junk faxes have been illegal since 1991. Since then, a federal law and Federal Communications Commission regulations have kept most machines free of unsolicited ads. But that may be changing. Why? ''Because Congress just pumped new life into the junk fax industry,'' according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center (epic.org), which issued a communication on the subject this week.
9/17/2005	SATURDAY INTERVIEW -- With Jim Donald; Also Trying To Sell a Cup Of Kindness	SINCE Starbucks exploded onto the national coffee scene a decade ago, the company has been growing at an over-caffeinated pace. The company says it wants to leap from 10,000 stores to 30,000 worldwide eventually, roughly the number of outlets McDonald's now has. Starbucks has strived to present itself as a socially and environmentally conscious operation. It recently purchased Ethos Water, a start-up bottled-water company that devotes a portion of its revenue to clean-water projects in developing countries.
9/11/2005	The Battle Is Joined, But Is the War Already Lost?	The trim green awning that wraps around a corner of Delancey and Allen Streets delivers an unmistakable message: Starbucks is coming to the Lower East Side. Perhaps predictably, in an area most famous for its hipsters, its radical politics and its mom-and-pop stores, the arrival of a chain that in some minds is synonymous with corporate expansion and homogenization has set some residents fuming.
7/31/2005	Sometimes the Sizzle Can Drown Out the Pitch	AFTER spending huge amounts on advertising and marketing in the late 1990's, companies are taking new approaches to building brands, says Kenneth J. Roberts, chief executive of Lippincott Mercer, a brand consulting firm. Following are excerpts from a conversation: Q. Aside from basic advertising and marketing, what does building a brand entail? A. What it's all about is reaching your customer through touch points, or all the points where people interact with a product. You know about Mercedes because you've seen the ads. Or you've visited the showroom. Or your best friend has one and told you about it. Or maybe you've test-driven one. Or maybe you've owned one or two or three. There are whole different levels of knowledge. Then there is a range of different experiences -- the buying or leasing experience, the ownership experience and the ''trying to find a hard-to-find part'' experience. All of those shape your perception of Mercedes as a brand. Q. Who's doing a really good job of branding these days? A. Have you flown on Virgin? They do a spectacular job. They've constructed an experience for their customers that's very different from the other airlines. They've identified the touch points. The safety video, for example, is a cartoon. When they give you the instructions to take your shoes off going down the slides, everyone in the video looks at this guy wearing cowboy boots. It's a little hipper, a little funnier than others.
7/24/2005	All Jazzed Up	Q: You're widely revered as the leading jazz pianist in this country, and I am wondering what led you to produce your forthcoming album, ''Possibilities,'' for the Starbucks Hear Music label. It's a fantastic business opportunity. Unlike record stores, which are geared toward young people between the ages of 18 and 24, Starbucks is not limited to younger listeners. Everyone goes to Starbucks.
7/22/2005	Along With That Caffeine Rush, a Taste of Seattle	It looks like a Starbucks. It smells and tastes like one too. Settle into one of the comfortable Starbucks-like armchairs and it certainly feels like the real thing. But the hottest cafe in the Ethiopian capital is not a Starbucks at all but a knockoff, the creation of a Starbucks devotee who tried to bring the real thing to Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, by many accounts. But she had to settle for a look-alike after the Seattle coffee giant rebuffed her partnership request.
7/18/2005	Corrections	A report in the ''Arts, Briefly'' column on Friday about an album of previously unreleased Bob Dylan songs to be issued on Aug. 30 misstated the period for which Starbucks will have exclusive rights to sell another Dylan album, starting the same day. It is 18 months, not 18 days.
6/28/2005	New to the Starbucks Menu: Exclusive Dylan	Starbucks plans to announce today that it will exclusively sell ''Bob Dylan: Live at the Gaslight 1962,'' further encroaching on the turf of traditional music retailers by offering a recording that has been prized by fans as a bootleg for decades. Over the last year, the chain has become a force in the music business with the success of the Grammy-winning album of Ray Charles duets, ''Genius Loves Company.'' Starbucks sold more than 750,000 copies of the album.
6/23/2005	Into the Light: Beyond a Fear of Fixtures	FOR the most part I have remained calm and reasonable as the renovation project has unfolded. Politely I endured bone-jarring hammering that felt like rhinoplasty. I stayed on speaking terms with the plumber even after grit shot out of a showerhead into my eye. I laughed gaily upon returning home to find the toilet I ordered online blocking access to the front porch.
6/16/2005	Your Cake and Slather It On, Too	A woman in her 50's vacationing in South America was touring a chocolate factory when its owner asked, ''Who wants to be covered in chocolate?'' The spunky gal, who'd had a bit to drink -- or so the story goes -- obliged. She woke the next morning to find she had, not a hangover but, lo and behold, extremely soft skin. ''It was amazing,'' said John Scharffenberger, a chocolatier in Berkeley, Calif., who retells the legend every chance he gets. ''The results lasted for weeks.''
6/13/2005	T-Mobile Adds Wi-Fi Hot Spots	T-Mobile, the country's fifth-largest cellular phone company, said over the weekend that it was doubling the number of locations where its customers can connect to the Internet over its wireless, or Wi-Fi, service. Customers who use the service will now be able to log on to the Internet in 25,000 ''hot spots'' or access points worldwide, up from the 12,200 hot spots T-Mobile now runs in the United States and overseas. The additional locations -- in 39 airports, several hotel chains and locations in Europe and Asia -- are operated by other carriers. T-Mobile Wi-Fi users will have to pay roaming charges on top of their weekly, monthly or yearly subscription fees; roaming fees are typically 12 to 18 cents a minute.
6/13/2005	Some Cafe Owners Pull the Plug on Lingering Wi-Fi Users	The staff at Victrola Caf & Art is sick of talking about Wi-Fi. Given the opportunity, as at a recent cupping in the back of the store to smell and taste the latest in-house roasts, the group prefers to talk about cafe culture, or how to create a nuanced light roasted coffee. But lately, the subject of Wi-Fi -- specifically, the cafe's move to cut back on the free Wi-Fi connection it provides for patrons' Internet use -- has been impossible to avoid. ''It's distracting,'' said Jen Strongin, a co-owner.
6/11/2005	One Nation, With Niches For All	E.B. White claimed he knew his wife was the girl for him when she referred to dental floss as ''tooth twine.'' I take his point. I also tried to buy ''tooth twine'' recently. By any name, that is an exercise in frustration, or affluence-induced A.D.D., or option overload. If there is plain old standard issue dental floss out there, it is on the shelf with the all-purpose running shoes and the unadulterated, adjectiveless cup of coffee. In taking cluster analysis and its classifications to the logical extreme, are we not building a superfinicky society? Five minutes in any Starbucks line will answer that one. We used to be one nation, undivided, under three networks, three car companies and two brands of toothpaste for all. Today we are the mass niche nation. This is a country in which 40 percent of the eligible population doesn't vote, but can be expected to maneuver its way through a sprawl of options every time it heads out for tooth twine. Increasingly the brick-and-mortar world resembles the virtual one: an infinite landscape of microscopic subcategories, in which one loses oneself, twice.
5/21/2005	Starbucks Aims to Alter China's Taste In Caffeine	The Starbucks Corporation plans to announce soon an accelerated push into the Chinese market, company executives said on Friday, the latest in a series of aggressive efforts by international food and beverage companies to expand in China. What is striking about these efforts, by McDonald's and KFC as well as Starbucks, is that they have made few concessions to Chinese tastes, instead cultivating in China an appetite for Western favorites, like Big Macs and grande lattes.
4/5/2005	Musical Shift At Starbucks	Starbucks, which has shown that it can market music by established musicians like Ray Charles as easily as it does Frappuccinos, now plans to test its reach by selling the debut CD of a little-known rock band. Starbucks is expected to announce today that its 4,400 shops in the United States will begin selling ''From the Ground Up,'' the first major-label release by the all-female quintet Antigone Rising, on May 11. The album is a live acoustic performance recorded specifically for Starbucks, which will be its exclusive retailer for an indefinite period, according to Ken Lombard, president of the company's entertainment unit.
12/23/2013	Pax Sheds Starbucks Stock	Pax World Funds, a mutual fund firm that invests in so-called socially responsible companies, said yesterday that it had sold its Starbucks Corporation stock because of the coffee chain's deal with Jim Beam Brands to sell a coffee liqueur. Pax has a policy of not investing in companies involved in alcohol, tobacco or gambling.
3/18/2005	The Little Things That Bug Us, and the Ways We Fight Back	To the Editor: I find it humorous that most of the people quoted in ''No Need to Stew: A Few Tips to Cope With Life's Annoyances'' seem to actually have no life. If they did, they'd not be wasting it on such trivial and inane matters as what Starbucks calls its sizes. If it is really that annoying, shop somewhere else and stop being annoyed. What a concept!
3/18/2005	The Little Things That Bug Us, and the Ways We Fight Back	To the Editor: I am 5 feet 4 inches tall. When I go to Starbucks, I order a ''small'' coffee. The friendly barista invariably asks, ''Do you mean a tall?''
3/15/2005	No Need to Stew: A Few Tips To Cope With Life's Annoyances	When Seth Shepsle goes to Starbucks, he orders a ''medium'' because ''grande'' -- as the coffee company calls the size, the one between big and small -- annoys him. Meg Daniel presses zero whenever she hears a computerized operator on the telephone so that she can talk to a real person. ''Just because they want a computer to handle me doesn't mean I have to play along,'' she said.
2/18/2005	Arts, Briefly; Grammy Fallout	Days after winning eight Grammy Awards, the posthumously released duets album with Ray Charles, right, ''Genius Loves Company'' has become the subject of a second lawsuit. A recording engineer had already sued Ray Charles Enterprises and Concord Records over credit on the album. And on Wednesday Don Mizell, a record producer and music executive, filed a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court for unspecified damages exceeding $1 million. In the suit -- filed against Act III Communications, owner of Concord; Ray Charles Enterprises; and Starbucks, which sold large quantities of the album -- Mr. Mizell contends that the companies are in breach of contract by using his concept for the album illegally. Representatives of Ray Charles Enterprises, Starbucks and Concord said they had not seen the complaint and could not comment. BEN SISARIO
2/17/2005	Starbucks Will Venture Into Coffee Liqueur	The Starbucks Corporation's latest attempt to create a beverage that is not just for breakfast starts today with the nationwide introduction of an alcoholic coffee drink. It will market the drink, Starbucks Coffee Liqueur, through a partnership with Jim Beam Brands, a unit of Fortune Brands.
1/27/2005	Earnings Rise at Starbucks	The Starbucks Corporation, the nation's largest chain of coffee shops, said yesterday that first-quarter earnings rose 31 percent as it raised prices and added more sandwiches and flavored coffee drinks to its menu. Net income rose to $144.9 million, or 35 cents a share, from $110.4 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, the company said. It was the smallest gain in more than a year but exceeded analysts' expectations. Sales in the quarter, which ended Jan. 2, climbed 24 percent, to $1.59 billion.
1/9/2005	A Marriage of New York Obsessions: Starbucks, and 'Do You Deliver?'	The sign arrived a few weeks before Christmas, hand-printed on pale blue paper and posted prominently by the cash register of the Starbucks at 85th Street and First Avenue. It offered local Upper East Side customers, seeking refuge from the first truly bone-chilling days of winter, a particularly New York kind of succor, even beyond steaming cups of double skim latte. Starbucks, the sign declared, would now deliver.
1/9/2005	Mom and Pop Are Leaving the Station	AT the Metro-North station here a few years ago, a taxi dispatcher looking for fares and teenagers looking for trouble were king. Today a more refined figure rules the place: a plump, pink, winged creature with a taste for fine food and architecture. The Hudson Valley Flying Pig Farm Market Cafe began leasing space in the century-old brick-and-wood station house five years ago, investing more than $500,000 in a handsome renovation.
12/23/2004	Rationalizing? Yes, but What a Deal	IN the 1970's there was a general belief that Santa was susceptible to flowery language. My brothers and I spent weeks crafting Dickensian salutations -- ''Kind Sir, I write with hope that both you and Mrs. S. have enjoyed good health and happiness in these long months since last we communicated'' -- to divert attention from the fact that our requests were so greedy. One year my brother asked for a car, hoping Santa would overlook the fact that in Illinois 8-year-olds didn't have driver's licenses. Once, the four of us co-signed a plea for a trip to Disneyland. Another letter mentioned a ''real Thompson submachine gun.''
12/5/2004	Like It or Not, the Postmodern Malt Shop	EVERY day, Ida Kowalenko drives from her home in Irvington to a place where everybody, it seems, knows her name. Eighty-three years old and divorced, her children grown and gone, Mrs. Kowalenko lives alone but does not live alone. She has her friends, lots of them, and meets them in a place at the corner of Millburn Avenue and Main Street in this affluent community. You know the place, even if you have never set foot in Millburn. It's Starbucks, and it looks pretty much like any of the more than 100 Starbucks in New Jersey, or the more than 8,000 around the world, which is the whole idea.
11/23/2004	World Business Briefing | Europe: Germany: Starbucks Venture To End	KarstadtQuelle sold the majority stake in its coffee shop joint venture with Starbucks to its partner, the group said. Starbucks previously held a 18 percent stake in Karstadt Coffee, which started its first shop in 2002 and has expanded to 37 stores in 15 German cities. The deal, effective Nov. 30, was part of KarstadtQuelle's efforts to restructure its department store and mail-order business, including large job cuts and the sale of unprofitable department stores. Starbucks confirmed the acquisition, but did not disclose the purchase price. Petra Kappl (NYT)
11/17/2004	Starbucks Will Use Cups With 10% Recycled Paper	Starting next year, Starbucks will add something new to its cups of coffee: recycled paper. Hoping to win over customers who care about the environment, Starbucks, the Seattle coffee company, plans to announce today that it will start stocking its stores with cups made with 10 percent recycled material.
11/11/2004	Starbucks Results Up Sharply for Quarter and the Year	Starbucks, in its quest to blanket the globe, reported quarterly results yesterday that were up sharply. Net income rose to $103 million, or 25 cents a share, in the 14 weeks ended Oct. 3, compared with the $70 million, or 17 cents a share, it earned in a 13-week period a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter increased to $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion.
11/7/2004	Starbucks Has Moved In, But It's Being Iced, Not Blended	First came the rumors. Next came the denials; it can't be happening here, people said. But then, construction started at the corner of Front and Main Streets, and a month ago, when residents saw the familiar green lettering go up, they knew it was true. Starbucks had come to Dumbo. Reaction was especially fierce at the Dumbo General Store, a four-year-old neighborhood hangout on Front Street that began as a supply center for the area's once-large artist population. Lately, it has added a cafe and restaurant to its supply business and is strongly defended by its patrons. When Starbucks came onto the scene, the sense of dread at the General Store grew large.
11/3/2004	Would You Like an Extra Shot of Music With That Macchiato?	Starbucks is growing increasingly aggressive about marketing music alongside its macchiatos and madeleines. ''Genius Loves Company,'' an album of Ray Charles duets that Starbucks' Hear Music division released in late summer as a joint venture with the independent label Concord Records, remained in the Billboard Top 10 for more than a month and recently went platinum. More than a quarter of the CD's sales were made in Starbucks coffee shops. Hear, a retailer and label that Starbucks bought five years ago, introduced a satellite radio channel in October that focuses on the kind of adult-oriented pop that Starbucks features. And last month Starbucks announced a plan to install a computer system in some of its United States locations that would let customers make a customized CD that could be assembled, packaged and purchased while they wait for drinks.
10/31/2004	A Bit of Froth to Help the Hegel Go Down	AS long as there are universities, as long as there are students in universities, and as long as there are clean filters filled with ground coffee, studying will probably take place in cafes. It may not always be interrupted, though, by shouts of ''Tall Chai!'' or ''Double Tall Sugar-free Vanilla Skim Latte!'' It is the season for midterms, and the Starbucks at 114th Street and Broadway cannot really compete with Columbia University's Butler Library as a place to study, though it can try. Management, in an enlightened moment, extended the shop's closing time from 11 p.m. to midnight in recent weeks for last-minute crammers and other assorted latterati. Butler's reading rooms are presumably a lot quieter, and several are open 24 hours a day. But some scholars feel they could do better.
10/17/2004	A Tempest In a Coffee Shop	SAVI KOCH, a sophomore at Mamaroneck High School has spent a lot of time recently pondering civil rights issues, but not in the classroom. The Starbucks adjacent to the high school here has been banning students from sitting down there, according to interviews with students and parents.
10/17/2004	A Tea Party, and All Boomers Are Invited	IF you were a tea lover a decade ago, you might have bought bags of Lipton in a yellow and red box at a supermarket. Or if you wanted something different, you chose Bigelow's spicier Constant Comment or Twinings. Today, however, tea drinkers pick from hundreds of varieties of green teas, exotic black teas and perhaps even white and red teas, and may well have stocked up on several of these specialties.
10/15/2004	STARBUCKS PLANS TO EXPAND BY 15,000 STORES IN THE U.S.	The Starbucks Corporation raised its goal for expansion in the United States by 50 percent, to 15,000 outlets, with plans for more stores in small towns, within other retailers and near its current urban sites. Starbucks' long-term plans call for 30,000 stores worldwide, including adding 1,500 next year to reach 10,000 stores, the chairman, Howard Schultz, said at a meeting with investors in Seattle, where the company is based. The prior goal was 25,000 stores, including 10,000 in the United States. Starbucks promoted Jim Donald to president and chief executive on Tuesday to lead the expansion.
10/13/2004	STARBUCKS ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE CHANGES	The Starbucks Corporation said yesterday that Jim Donald would take over as president and chief executive on March 31 when Orin Smith retires after five years on the job. Mr. Donald, 50, president of Starbucks' North American division since 2002, previously led Pathmark Stores Inc. Mr. Smith, 62, has been with Starbucks since 1990. The company, which is based in Seattle, also promoted Jim Alling to the new position of president of Starbucks Coffee U.S. Starbucks has about 6,000 stores in the United States and 2,500 stores outside the United States.
10/10/2004	Corrections	A note in the Week Ahead column last Sunday about a rise in prices at Starbucks misstated the amount. Prices rose last week by 11 cents, not 11 percent.
9/29/2004	STARBUCKS TO RAISE COFFEE PRICES BY 11 CENTS A CUP	The Starbucks Corporation, the coffee shop operator, said it planned to raise its average price per cup by 11 cents in North America to cover the higher cost of ingredients. The increase, the first since August 2000, will take effect Oct. 6, the company said. Starbucks, which operates more than 8,000 stores, said earlier this month that it would increase drink prices by the end of the year. Sales at outlets open at least 13 months gained 8 percent in August, the smallest increase in 10 months.
9/26/2004	Word for Word/Caff Conflict; Want a Fat Lip With That Latte, Bub?	PEOPLE, people, people! Why so tense? Too much caffeine? That may explain the testy tone of a debate on this question: Does the counter help at Starbucks deserve tips?
9/15/2004	COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- Bronx; A Major Retail Presence Just North of Manhattan	Not far from Spuyten Duyvil, the junction of the Harlem and Hudson Rivers in northern Manhattan, two commercial development trends have also converged: a big-box retailer with a major suburban presence has established an urban beachhead and in the process desolate industrial land has been given a much more lucrative reuse. The result is River Plaza, a $90 million 235,000-square-foot shopping center, which officially opened in August at 40 West 225th Street near the banks of the Harlem River.
9/12/2004	Seeking the Buzz Starbucks Couldn't Get	HERE comes Jean M. Delphonse, a look of concentration on his face, shuttling from the Broadway local and his day job handling Web site content at TheStreet.com, the online financial newspaper, to his first solo business venture, a coffee shop tucked among the brownstones of Hamilton Heights, just north of Morningside Heights. In one hand, he clutches a book called ''Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk.'' Risk has been on his mind lately. The coffee shop, at 140th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, is not yet open to customers, but the front door is ajar. ''I'm just going to grab a chair,'' he says as he strides in, nodding to the workers installing bathroom tile. Then he reaches into a cardboard box and pulls out a wooden folding chair, still wrapped in a mantle of protective paper.
9/4/2004	Tempest in a Starbucks Cup? A Billing Expos Turns Out to Be Decaffeinated	When a lawyer bills $500 an hour plus expenses for his services, does adding $3 to the bill for a cup of cappuccino at breakfast each morning cross the line? On Thursday, The Journal Inquirer of Manchester, Conn., published a report detailing several questionable expenses that it claimed taxpayers were charged by the New York law firm that was advising state lawmakers whether to impeach John G. Rowland as governor.
8/24/2004	Musicland tries to embrace the Internet and emulate the atmosphere of retail chains like Starbucks.	IN June 2003, Best Buy transferred ownership of the Musicland Group to a private investment company, asking for nothing but the investors' assumption of Musicland's debt and lease obligations. Just over a year later, Musicland, of Minnetonka, Minn., has named Zimmerman Partners in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to handle its account, with billings estimated at $50 million. The two companies are poised to execute the next step in a turnaround plan: makeovers for the 900 stores that Musicland runs under the Sam Goody, Media Play and Suncoast Motion Picture brands, which collectively sell CD's as well as entertainment products ranging from DVD's to movie posters to books.
6/11/2004	Rebel Barista With a Cause (Make That a Venti)	IN the cozy corporate lingo of Starbucks, the java-servers in company baseball caps and green aprons are so far evolved from folks who, in quainter, less caffeinated and less linguistically sensitive times, were dubbed soda jerks, that the coffee chain graces them with a special name: baristas. The moniker conveys a Euro-cachet, implies a certain skill set and is the entry-level niche at a $15 billion behemoth with a hot -- in more ways than one -- product and a rung on the Fortune 100 best-places-to-work list. Baristas like Daniel E. Gross who pour enough coffee fast enough, and with affable competence, can command $8.09 per hour after a year on the job, up from a starting wage of $7.75. Scalding stuff, according to Mr. Gross, with or without meager tips. And without a defined workload: no barista is guaranteed a 40-hour week.
6/7/2004	Where Entrepreneurs Go And the Internet Is Free; Wi-Fi Providers Rethink How to Make Money	Linda Branagan would seem to be the ideal customer for entrepreneurs and telecommunications companies looking to make money selling wireless Internet connections. But, like thousands of business road warriors, Ms. Branagan often does not pay for the service because she gets it free. At cafes, malls and downtown business districts, there has been an explosion of Internet access points, or Wi-Fi hot spots, that let computer users log on to the Internet for free. That growth is a fundamental reason -- though not the only one -- that technology start-ups, investors and industry analysts who had high hopes for Wi-Fi are scrambling to find sustainable business models.
6/6/2004	Camouflaged in Clapboard	SHOPPERS toting bags of Target goods tied up traffic in Bridgehampton, and in East Hampton there were enough plastic cups filled with iced frappuccino on Main Street to make one think the new Starbucks had been there for years. The newest chain stores to open in the Hamptons made plenty of sales but few enemies over the Memorial Day weekend, a sign that national brands may be learning from experience not to toot their own horns too loudly when they can't resist the money to be made in New York's summer playground. At the same time, locals seemed less hostile to the chain retailers that dot the nation's landscape but that until recently often met resentment in the Hamptons hamlets, which pride themselves on small-town charm.
6/3/2004	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Starbucks Employee Seeks Union	Lawyers representing the Starbucks company and the Industrial Workers of the World met at the Manhattan office of the National Labor Relations Board yesterday for a hearing on a drive to unionize a Midtown Starbucks, which would be the chain's first union shop in the United States. An employee at the shop at 200 Madison Avenue, Daniel Gross, submitted a petition on May 17 seeking an election that would be administered by the board. About 13 employees in the shop would be represented by the union, Mr. Gross said. The lawyers argued yesterday over whether a lone shop has the right to form a union. Colin Moynihan (NYT)
5/25/2004	MEMO PAD	STANDBY TO STANDBY -- Aviation and government officials are sounding the alarm: With air traffic approaching pre-2001 levels, get ready for worsening airport delays. ''Even though we are not yet into the summer months, typically the busiest for the airlines, we are already seeing delays and congestion resulting from the rebound in airline traffic,'' Kenneth M. Mead, the Department of Transportation inspector general, told a Senate committee last week. Because of intense low-fare airline competition at major airlines' hubs, some airports with high delay rates last summer will handle even more flights this summer, a report by the agency said. For example, Kennedy Airport, where 25.1 percent of flights were delayed last summer, has 20 percent more flights scheduled this summer. Washington Dulles, where 22.5 percent of flights were delayed last summer, has 17 percent more scheduled flights this summer.
5/2/2004	I'd Like a Mocha Frappuccino, And a Six-Figure Job in Finance	There is one Midtown coffee shop where the buzz comes from something in addition to the espresso. That would be the Starbucks at 48th Street and Park Avenue, which is surrounded by J.P. Morgan Chase & Company to the south, UBS across the street, Deutsche Bank upstairs and law firms, hedge funds and investment banks in between. This Starbucks might be mistaken for a corporate boardroom. Rather than playing host to the screenwriters, students and tourists seen lounging at other cafes around the city, this one reflects its capitalist surroundings.
4/18/2004	Trying to Save the Chai Latte in Hamilton Heights	When a new Starbucks pops up in parts of Manhattan, some residents invariably bemoan its sterile corporate-ness, then give in and buy coffee there anyway. So Regina McRae's reaction to the Starbucks that opened two years ago in her neighborhood, Hamilton Heights, was counterintuitive: she was thrilled by its presence, but she never went there. She does not drink coffee. ''The neighborhood has a lot of problems, and most of us are pioneers,'' said Ms. McRae, a cake designer who moved to the West Harlem neighborhood three years ago. ''Having Starbucks in the area gave us an air of legitimacy. We weren't just a denizen of the drug world.''
4/8/2004	Starbucks Selects Wieden & Kennedy	The Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle has named Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., as its agency of record, handling assignments to help support its retail business in North America. Billings were estimated at $15 million to $20 million.
3/28/2004	Cream and Sugar, and the Milk of Human Kindness	IT is 7 a.m. on a Friday at the Bishop's Corner Starbucks in West Hartford, and despite the early hour and subzero temperatures outside, it is an oasis of warmth and good cheer inside. The store manager, William Webster, is presiding with a mix of wit, charm and personal service that has won the admiration of area business executives, intent on providing their own consummate customer service. Mr. Webster has acquired hundreds of devoted customers, a dedication in a book by a nationally acclaimed nonprofit executive, gratitude from numerous nonprofit groups that he and his staff have helped, and awards both local and nationally for his shop and managerial skills.
3/16/2004	Technology Briefing | Internet: Starbucks' New Music Service	The Starbucks Corporation is introducing a music service to make personalized CD's for customers while they sip. Working with Hewlett-Packard, Starbucks will open its first Hear Music store in Santa Monica, Calif., today, and plans to put music kiosks in 2,500 stores over the next two years. The system allows users to choose from more than 250,000 online songs, and to burn CD's for $6.99 for five songs, with each additional tune costing $1. Howard Schultz, Starbucks' chairman, called the move a natural extension of the company's success in selling its own brand of CD's in stores around the world. John Schwartz (NYT)
3/3/2004	Designer coffee, a cup at a time, while keeping your taste buds at home.	COFFEE drinkers, get ready for $150 million or more worth of java jive, courtesy of the world's best-known sellers of coffee and coffee makers. The ambitious goals of their advertising and marketing campaigns: persuade millions of consumers who increasingly prefer to leave home for their coffee fixes to stay home -- and add another appliance to crowded kitchens. The appliance in question is a new kind of coffee maker, priced at $60 to $120, which is intended to brew a cup at a time in about a minute, using coffee in prepackaged packets called pods. The machines, with names like Home Caf, Senseo and Tassimo, will compete against lower-priced automatic-drip devices as well as more expensive machines, typically imported, that specialize in espresso.
1/16/2004	New American Beachhead in France: Starbucks	Starbucks will open its first shop in France on Friday, hoping to spread ''to go'' coffee culture among Parisians long used to waiting for their drinks and lingering for hours in one of the city's 2,000 traditional cafes. The company plans to open 8 to 10 shops in Paris by the end of the year. Along with its first outlet, on the chic Avenue de l'Opera in the heart of Paris, two more will open shortly, one in the business district of La Dfense on Monday, and another in Montparnasse before the end of February, Howard Schultz, the company's chief executive, said at a news conference on Thursday.
12/10/2003	Restaurant Hiring May Lead the Way To Wider Job Gains	The restaurant industry has gone on a hiring spree over the last four months, suggesting that broader gains in the job market could be on the way. Since the beginning of August, the restaurant business, which includes everything from McDonald's to corner bars to four-star restaurants, has accounted for 18 percent of the 300,000 jobs created in the nation.
12/8/2003	A Tall Decaf, Mocha Cappuccino and the Wi-Fi Selection of the Month, Please	The Starbucks Corporation has been at the vanguard of offering wireless Internet access in the popular Wi-Fi format, with wireless ''hot spots'' in about 2,600 of its 4,100 stores in the United States as a way to encourage customers to come in, log on and hang out. Anticipating the day when Wi-Fi alone may not distinguish one retailer from another, Starbucks is experimenting with the equivalent of Wi-Fi flavors of the month. In October, customers with Wi-Fi-enabled laptops could sit in a Starbucks and watch free film footage of blues musicians like Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, as well as blues documentaries on which Martin Scorsese was the executive producer. On Nov. 28, Starbucks began offering its Wi-Fi patrons free streaming audio of holiday stories produced in conjunction with National Public Radio. A selection of stories, changing weekly, is available through Jan. 1.
11/29/2003	Move Over Starbucks, Juan Valdez Is Coming	How about a nice large cup of coffee, light on the guilt? The Colombian Coffee Federation, which represents more than 500,000 Colombian coffee growers, is planning to open its first coffee shops -- all bearing the name Juan Valdez, after the federation's signature character -- in the United States by early 2004. Gabriel Silva, the president of the federation, which is based in Bogot, says the coffee growers have been ''too passive'' in claiming a larger piece of the $8.4 billion specialty coffee industry.
11/24/2003	Counting CD Sales Isn't an Exact Science	Folks who walked into the more than 300 Hallmark Cards Inc. stores across the country earlier this month may have noticed ''Closer,'' the new CD by Josh Groban, amid all the greeting cards, Christmas ornaments and stuffed animals. Time Warner, whose Reprise Records label released the album, is hoping Mr. Groban's adult contemporary sound strikes a chord with Hallmark customers, an older crowd than the one that typically visits the music store. But, if it does, the sales may not count -- not, that is, in the weekly tally compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, the bible of sales data for the music industry, and the foundation of the influential Billboard Top 200 albums chart.
9/28/2003	The Global Reach Of Starbucks; Sameness or Security, Even in Taiwan	To the Editor: Caffeine notwithstanding, I regard Starbucks as being responsible for slowing down New York. A commendable feat.
9/28/2003	The Global Reach Of Starbucks; Sameness or Security, Even in Taiwan	To the Editor: As a Hunter High School student, I noticed that my Starbucks was on the cover of the City section. Despite the lack of big armchairs, Starbucks is the perfect place to study for a math test or do homework due the next period.
9/28/2003	The Global Reach Of Starbucks; Sameness or Security, Even in Taiwan	To the Editor: Re ''Latte on the Hudson'' by Patricia Volk (Sept. 21): Before I left the States to live in Taipei, I felt slightly disapproving of what seemed the corporate sameness of every Starbucks and avoided them as much as possible. But after misadventures ordering in a foreign tongue and navigating the dodginess of Taiwanese public rest rooms, there was something comforting about entering a Starbucks that was identical to the ones back home, from the menu to the dcor of the (very clean) bathroom.
9/28/2003	The Global Reach Of Starbucks; Sameness or Security, Even in Taiwan	To the Editor: Patricia Volk's paean to Starbucks incensed those of us who prefer that New York cafes spring from native ambitions rather than from frothing corporate monsters on the leftcoast.
9/7/2003	Business People; Latte and Paintbrush, to Go	Orin Smith, the chief executive of Starbucks, has cut down trees and helped clean up a beach as part of his company's volunteer corps. This month, he wants customers to join him. September is ''Make Your Mark'' month at Starbucks. The company, based in Seattle, is sponsoring community projects, like painting houses and fixing up parks, across the United States and Canada. Starbucks started the program in 2000 for employees. Last year, it asked customers to join in, and got 25,000 hours of volunteer work. It hopes to make that a double this year: 50,000 hours.
8/31/2003	For a Latte Landmark, the Last Drop	New York City's first Starbucks has served its last latte. The branch, at 2379 Broadway, at 87th Street, closed two weeks ago in a neighborhood that has changed tremendously since Starbucks came on the local scene nearly a decade ago. When the store at 87th Street welcomed its first caffeine-charged customers in April 1994, national chains and upscale retailers and restaurants were not common in that part of the Upper West Side. Today, within three blocks of the former Starbucks, the Gap, Godiva, Coach, Origins, Banana Republic and Victoria's Secret are all represented. Aldo Shoes, based in Quebec, plans to open a store at 86th Street and Broadway in the fall.
8/17/2003	Retail Chains Arrive, but With Weak Links	WHEN Starbucks opened its first Bronx store at 314 East Fordham Road in 1999, it added an upscale touch to a bustling commercial strip and was heralded as another sign of economic revival. Fernando Ferrer, the borough president then, brewed a ceremonial first espresso. Four years later, the lines of customers at 314 East Fordham Road are longer than Starbucks' marketers could have dreamed. But it is no longer a Starbucks. The coffeehouse declined to renew its lease and slipped out quietly in May 2002 and was replaced by a T-Mobile store.
7/25/2003	Starbucks Posts 23% Profit Increase for Quarter	Starbucks said yesterday that third-quarter profit climbed 23 percent as new stores and products like malt-flavored drinks bolstered sales. Net income increased to $68.4 million, or 17 cents a share, from $55.7 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue increased 24 percent, to $1 billion.
7/14/2003	E-Commerce Report; Starbucks and McDonald's lead the drive for the customer that uses wireless Internet technology.	SINCE the dot-com bust, selling goods and services through wireless Internet connections has been considered little more than a blue-sky vision trotted out in Internet business plans. But in recent months, the concept seems to be gaining some relevance. Last week, McDonald's began offering wireless Internet connections -- through the Wi-Fi radio technology format -- in 75 of its restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area, and will add hundreds more in Chicago and New York by the end of the year. McDonald's tested its wireless services in 10 New York restaurants earlier this year.
7/1/2003	A Tall Order at Starbucks: More Caffeine on Ice	With much of the country sweltering, this probably is not the best time to be asking, ''How about a nice cup of hot coffee?'' So, to bring customers into its stores for more than a morning caffeine fix, Starbucks today is introducing a new line of iced tea, coffee and tea lemonade drinks that are, like James Bond's martini, shaken, not stirred.
6/2/2003	New Economy; How Starbucks was put on the defensive by an attack on the Internet rumor mill that would not go away.	After receiving an e-mail message one evening in April, Clara Miller thought her love affair with Starbucks was over. According to the e-mail message, titled ''Starbucks vs. Israel,'' the Starbucks Corporation was closing all its stores in Israel in May. The note did not include information about why the company had decided to pull out of Israel, but its tone suggested a nefarious intent. Some people assumed that Starbucks was joining an Arab boycott of American businesses in Israel, while others thought the company had decided to abandon its business in the country for fear of terrorist attacks.
5/15/2003	STARBUCKS IN JOINT VENTURE TO EXPAND INTO CHILE	The Starbucks Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to a joint venture with Grain Red to open coffee shops in Chile. Financial terms were not disclosed. The joint venture, Sur-Andino Cafe, plans to open the first Starbucks store in Santiago during the second half of this year, Starbucks said. It will be the company's first foray into South America. In September, Starbucks expanded into Mexico and Puerto Rico. Grain Red, majority owned by Castano, is a Chilean company that focuses on food and beverage retail development.
4/17/2003	STARBUCKS AGREES TO ACQUIRE SEATTLE COFFEE COMPANY	Starbucks said yesterday that it had entered into an agreement to acquire the Seattle Coffee Company from AFC Enterprises Inc. for $72 million in cash and stock. Under the deal, Starbucks would own the Seattle's Best and Torrefazione Italia Coffee brands, 129 Seattle's Best coffee shops and 21 Torrefazione coffee shops. The deal was expected to close within 90 days and to reduce the company's earnings by 1 cent in 2003, Starbucks said. Sherri Day (NYT)
4/6/2003	Starbucks Closes Shops in Israel	Starbucks said it had closed all of its shops in Israel. The six coffeehouses were in Tel Aviv and employed about 120 people. The company blamed ''operational challenges,'' apparently stemming from that country's weak economy, not the turmoil in the Middle East, for the closings.
2/21/2003	Starbucks Plans to Offer Its Own Credit Card in Fall	Starbucks customers will soon be able to pick up revolving credit lines with their double tall mocha lattes. Today, Starbucks, Bank One and Visa are expected to announce the creation of a Starbucks credit card, set to make its debut in the fall. It will function as a traditional credit card and will double as a rechargeable Starbucks store card, allowing customers to prepay for purchases by loading money onto the card.
2/20/2003	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Starbucks Profit Falls	Profit at Starbucks Coffee Japan fell 70 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year because of growing competition from rival coffee chains. Starbucks earned a pretax profit of 353 million yen ($3 million) from April to December. Sales rose 17.9 percent, to 41.4 billion yen, with most of the gains from new stores. Sales at stores open more than one year fell 16 percent. The company reaffirmed that it expected to report a loss of 500 million yen for the full year, which ends March 31. Ken Belson (NYT)
1/24/2003	Starbucks Earnings Up 17%	The Starbucks Corporation, the largest chain of coffee shops, said today that first-quarter earnings rose 17 percent, helped by strong holiday sales. The company also raised its forecast for the year. Net income climbed to $80 million, or 20 cents a share, from $68.4 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales in the quarter that ended Dec. 29 increased 25 percent, to $1 billion, from $805.3 million as Starbucks opened more coffee shops.
1/8/2003	Few Officials At Companies Expect Surge In Dividends	We'll keep our cash, thank you. So say many of the large companies that do not pay dividends to their shareholders, predicting that President Bush's plan to eliminate the tax on personal dividends will not impel them to make a quick change.
11/15/2002	STARBUCKS SAYS EARNINGS ROSE 9.8% IN FOURTH QUARTER	Starbucks said yesterday that its earnings rose 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter as prepaid gift cards and new flavors for its frappuccino drink helped sales. Net income climbed to $58.5 million, or 15 cents a share, from $53.2 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales in the period, which ended Sept. 29, rose 25 percent, to $865.2 million, as Starbucks opened more outlets. Sales at coffee shops open at least a year rose 8 percent, more than the company's forecast.
11/7/2002	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Starbucks Expects A Loss	Starbucks Coffee Japan, citing falling sales of food and coffee beans, will lose money and pay no dividend for the year ending in March 2003. Starbucks Japan expects to lose 500 million yen ($4.1 million) this year after forecasting a gain of 950 million yen previously. The coffee maker also cut its sales target by 9.7 percent, to 56 billion yen ($508 million). Ken Belson (NYT)
10/27/2002	F.Y.I.	Bridge for Sale Q. I read last week that Mayor Bloomberg was considering selling the Brooklyn Bridge to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It made me wonder: Where did the old joke about selling the Brooklyn Bridge come from? A. It's difficult to say exactly where the joke came from, but the joke is probably as old as the bridge, which opened in 1883. Barry Popik, a contributor to the Dictionary of American Regional English, points to an article in The New York Times on Feb. 15, 1920, that referred to the joke as old even back then.
10/18/2002	STARBUCKS GIVES POST TO EXECUTIVE OF PATHMARK	The Starbucks Corporation named James L. Donald president of its North American business as of Nov. 1. Mr. Donald, the chief executive of Pathmark Stores, will succeed Howard Behar, who led Starbucks North America on an interim basis. Mr. Behar will remain on the board of Starbucks and its international subsidiary. Mr. Donald will oversee Starbucks's 4,574 company-owned and licensed stores in the United States and Canada. Pathmark, a supermarket chain based in Carteret, N.J., said that Eileen Scott would become chief executive and Frank G. Vitrano president.
10/6/2002	Who's to Blame For a School's Pain?; Drinking Coffee With Cause	To the Editor: Re ''Gazing Into a Coffee Cup and Seeing the World,'' Anemona Hartocollis's Sept. 29 Coping column, I wonder if people are familiar with Fair Trade coffee, available in some coffee shops and many co-ops and health food stores. Fair Trade coffee is a result of an international movement that helps businesses buy directly from rural coffee cooperatives, eliminating the corporate middleman and paying farmers double or more the market price.
9/29/2002	Gazing Into a Coffee Cup And Seeing the World	IF you were, say, Rimbaud or Toulouse-Lautrec and living in New York today, would you be romanticizing latte instead of absinthe? Passing a Starbucks and peering through the plate-glass window at patrons mesmerized by a cup of strong coffee and a newspaper, the person next to them or nothing at all, it seems possible, at least for a fanciful moment, that you would. Coffee bars are the last refuge of conspicuous consumption. Designer labels are no longer chic, except among rap stars and tourists. Modesty is in. But the $3.75 grande latte at Starbucks is a permissible indulgence. Addictive, nonhallucinogenic and perfectly legal. Now comes the news that coffee growers in Central America, Africa and Asia are starving. Americans pay an average of $3.60 a pound for supermarket brand coffee, and the farmers earn a mere 24 cents a pound for their beans. I feel guilty. I think about those magazine ads that picture innocent children in threadbare clothes whose lives can be changed for just pennies a month. But then I remember my reaction to those ads. Could changing a life be so simple? There must be some kind of a catch.
9/7/2002	Commerce Fills a New York Need: Toilets	Finding a restroom in New York City was once the most harrowing of urban experiences. There are no public restrooms on the sidewalks and most bathrooms in subway stations were closed long ago. Things were so bad that books were published telling New Yorkers how to navigate lobby mazes to find the powder rooms hidden in hotels. But these days finding a bathroom in many New York neighborhoods is as easy as spotting the nearest Starbucks. Or Old Navy. Or Gap. Or Barnes & Noble. Or Virgin Megastore.
8/22/2002	Technology Briefing | Internet: Starbucks Expands Web Network Service	The Starbucks Corporation, in a venture with the T-Mobile International division of Deutsche Telekom and the Hewlett-Packard Company, added 700 high-speed wireless network service outlets yesterday in cities in New Jersey and Connecticut and in Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Philadelphia and Portland, Ore., as well as in three international test stores in London and Berlin, for a total of nearly 1,200 outlets. The service, available for those with laptop computers and hand-held devices, uses the Wi-Fi standard, and has been renamed T-Mobile HotSpot. The new locations join 500 outlets in the Seattle, San Francisco and New York regions and in three cities in Texas. The companies said they expected to add 800 more outlets by the end of the year. Hewlett-Packard will provide free software to make wireless connections easier, according to Bloomberg News. Starbucks has a revenue-sharing agreement with T-Mobile. Shares of Starbucks fell 18 cents, to $20.87. Glenn Fleishman (NYT)
7/9/2002	In Japan, Make That Starbucks to Go	Lighting up a subway station on the Ginza Line with his 1,000-watt smile, Howard Schultz, chairman of Starbucks, was showing off an innovation for caffeine-deprived Japanese commuters -- no tables, no chairs, just take out in a paper bag. ''We are literally intercepting throngs of people at the rush hour,'' he said of the new takeout coffee stand, little bigger than a newspaper kiosk, that discreetly pumped coffee aroma toward the defenseless nostrils of marching ranks of salary men and women.
6/23/2002	It's So Long, Smooth Talker, As a Kiosk Gets Set to Close	For nine years, office workers near Bryant Park have been receiving heady compliments along with their lattes from Simon Mammon, the chatty proprietor of the Simon Sips kiosk in the park's northwest corner. The other day, when Eleanor Williamson, marketing director for Edison Schools, came to Simon Sips for frozen yogurt, ''He right away said, 'I have to tell you, you have the most beautiful eyes in the world,' '' she recalled. Her response was, ''So do you.'' Gael Towey, the creative director of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and a longtime regular, added: ''I refuse wedding proposals at least once a day. If I didn't know Simon better, I'd be worried.''
6/18/2002	Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Arrests In Coffeehouse Robberies	Two men have been arrested in connection with armed robberies at Starbucks franchises in Midtown, the police said yesterday. The men, Keston Keane, 21, of Brooklyn, and Harold Chestnut, 22, of the Bronx, have been linked to three robberies this year and are being investigated in connection with two robberies last year. The two men were arrested around 6:30 p.m. Saturday when officers responded to a robbery at the Starbucks at Madison Avenue and 36th Street, which was robbed on May 24 by the same men, the police said. Mr. Keane asked to speak with the manager and then announced a robbery, investigators said. In three robberies, the police say, the two men stole $14,000. Jacob H. Fries (NYT)
6/1/2002	An American Coffeehouse (or 4) in Vienna	It takes some hubris to bring an American coffee shop to Vienna, the city of cafes, and then to ban smoking in it. But no one has ever considered Starbucks humble. And the move, a keystone of Starbucks' rapid expansion in Europe, appears to have paid off.
4/29/2002	Veni, Venti, Grande; Starbucks Strikes Deep in a Wary Land of Pushcarts and Delis	Mark Damian, an East Village writer with a pierced chin, consumes a lot of coffee -- five or more cups of strong brew every day. He likes to drink it at Java N Jazz, an independent cafe near Union Square, which he says has more character than Starbucks. Nonetheless, Mr. Damian, 31, admits that he can often be found at a Starbucks shop. ''You can't really avoid them,'' he said.
4/26/2002	PROFIT FALLS AFTER STARBUCKS SETTLES TWO LAWSUITS	The Starbucks Corporation said yesterday that net income fell slightly in its second quarter, to $32.1 million, or 8 cents a share, because of expenses to settle two lawsuits. The company earned $32.2 million, or 8 cents, a year ago. Starbucks said it expected revenue to increase 22 to 24 percent this year, up from a previous projection of a 20 percent rise. It agreed to settle two class-action lawsuits that challenged the status of store managers and assistant managers in California as exempt employees under wage and hour laws. That shaved profit by 3 cents a share. Sales in the second quarter rose 24 percent, to $783.2 million from $629.3 million.
4/11/2002	World Business Briefing | Europe: Spain: Starbucks Opens 2 Cafes	Starbucks has opened its first two cafes in Spain, well known for its caffeine and cigarette habits, as part of a drive to expand in Europe, where the company hopes to have 650 outlets by the end of 2003. The Spanish operation, run as a joint venture with Grupo Vips, a leading restaurant and retail group, and El Moli Vell, a Catalan bakery chain, plans 10 to 15 more outlets besides the 2 Madrid stores within the next two years and is expected to make a profit by 2005. Starbucks does not plan to relax its no-smoking policy, even though at least a third of Spaniards smoke. Emma Daly (NYT)
3/24/2002	The Capitalist Communitarian	A couple of months ago, I was talking to Howard Schultz in the lobby of the Seattle SuperSonics' practice facility. Schultz, the chairman and chief global strategist of Starbucks and the new principal owner of the Seattle N.B.A. team, continually emphasizes that ''the Sonics are a public trust'' and that his primary motivation in purchasing the team is not to feed his own ego or to make money but to ''return the team to where it once was'' (the Sonics won the N.B.A. championship 23 years ago) by restoring a communal spirit within and around it. While we were talking, one of us dropped a dime on the floor. Schultz bent down to pick it up and offered it to me, since it wasn't clear which one of us had dropped it. ''You think I can be bribed so easily?'' I asked. Schultz blanched, and he took a full step back. In Schultz's world, money is obviously such a deep subtext that it can never be mentioned explicitly in public, even if it's only a joke, only a dime. A minute or two later, as if to recover, he stage-whispered to the Sonics' public-relations director to tell me about how Desmond Mason, a second-year player, was going to visit a terminally ill teenager that afternoon. Like Mark Cuban, principal owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and Jeffrey Lurie, principal owner of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League, the 48-year-old Schultz is a baby-boomer tycoon who made an enormous amount of money in the 1990's and then spent a substantial portion of his fortune on a sports franchise. Both Schultz and Cuban are strikingly hands-on owners. Cuban, who has listed his e-mail address on the Mavericks' scoreboard, has said: ''Some owners in professional sports treat it like a car in the garage they can pull out every now and again and tool around in, but it's my life's blood. . . . There's a difference in running a business and owning a business. I'm running a business.''
3/14/2002	Do Cellphone Users Need Even More Coffee?	In an area where coffee is king, the quickest caffeine fix just got a little quicker. Starbucks Coffee of Seattle recently began a pilot program in 12 stores in the Puget Sound region that enables customers to order their coffee from their wireless phones, bypassing the cash register altogether. The service, called Starbucks Express, runs on technology from Ontain, a company based in Bellevue, Wash. To sign up, a customer logs on at www.starbucks-express .com, chooses a user name, sets up a debit account and selects five drink preferences. To order a drink, the customer dials (206) 428-SBUX, responds to a series of automated prompts and punches in the number of the desired beverage. The order goes to the store within seconds, the drink is prepared and the payment is deducted from the customer's account. All the customer has to do is walk in and pick up the drink from the bar.
10/21/2001	As Starbucks Grows, Japan, Too, Is Awash	HOWARD SCHULTZ said he knew Starbucks would be a hit in Japan the day he opened his first store here in 1996. When Mr. Schultz, the company's chairman, arrived in the fashionable Ginza district at 6:15 on that humid August morning, 100 people were lined up for the ribbon-cutting, scheduled for 6:30. At the front of the line was a man in his 20's who looked as if he had slept outside the shop the night before. When the doors opened, he rushed in to become customer No. 1 in Japan. Although he otherwise spoke no English, he blurted: ''Double short latte!''
10/11/2001	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Starbucks Stock	Shares in Starbucks Coffee Japan, the local subsidiary of the Seattle chain, surged on the first day of trading. The stock closed at $581 a share, 9 percent above its initial offering price of $531. The stock is traded on Nasdaq Japan in Osaka. Demand for the stock was strong as it opened at $664 a share and traded as high as $692 before settling back. The company will use the 17.9 billion yen ($149 million) it raised to add 180 new shops to its 300-store chain over the next three years. Ken Belson (NYT)
10/5/2001	STARBUCKS IN JOINT VENTURE WITH GERMAN RETAILER	The Starbucks Corporation, the specialty coffee chain, said yesterday that it had formed a joint venture with KarstadtQuelle, Germany's biggest department store company, to expand into Germany. The first Starbucks store in Germany, which has Europe's biggest economy, is expected to open in Berlin in early spring, Starbucks said. Starbucks, which has more than 4,600 outlets worldwide, has said it sees potential for as many as 1,400 stores in Germany. Starbucks, which is based in Seattle, has six shops in Switzerland and plans to open in Vienna in December, as part of a plan to open at least 650 outlets in Continental Europe by the end of 2003.
9/9/2001	Together at Last: Cutting Pollution And Making Money	NOTICE the common thread running through these three tales? *The Starbucks Corporation, responding to concerns that growing coffee caused rain-forest carnage, spends some $200,000 to help Mexican farmers improve the quality of beans grown under a forest canopy. ''We weren't sure they'd ever grow beans we would sell,'' said Orin C. Smith, the company's chief executive. In fact, the premium-priced coffee produced by the Mexicans turns out to be so tasty, and is selling so well in the United States, that Starbucks is introducing it overseas and to institutional customers. It has increased its order for Mexican shade-grown beans tenfold since the program began in late 1998 and is negotiating with shade-growers in four other countries. ''We risked this for the environmental benefits, but it now has potential to be a really profitable product,'' Mr. Smith said.
6/20/2001	Seattle Journal; An Unlikely Protest at a Starbucks	After a white police officer here fatally shot a black man late last month, the aftermath followed in many ways a sadly familiar refrain. The relatives of the dead man, Aaron Roberts, said he was a victim of racist police. The white officer who killed him said the shooting was justified, contending that Mr. Roberts, 37, had placed another officer's life in jeopardy. City and county officials have promised a full investigation; the F.B.I. is on the case.
6/17/2001	The Word That Strikes Fear in a Neighborhood's Heart. (Sshhh.) It's Starbucks.	Had Gregory Vena, a young man whiling away his Monday morning in a Bedford Avenue cafe, heard the Williamsburg rumor? ''What rumor?'' he said. ''You mean that they're opening a Starbucks in Williamsburg?''
5/13/2001	Coffee and Charm, Not From Seattle	THE bottomless cup of coffee. The waitresses who sing out your first name when your order is ready. The dimly lighted, music-free room with the worn wooden floors and the small wooden tables and chairs. All are among the enduring, funky charms of the Hungarian Pastry Shop, which is celebrating an important anniversary next month. Most charming, many of the longtime customers say, is how little the pastry shop on Morningside Heights has changed in its 40 years of existence.
5/2/2001	TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING  Telecommunications: Starbucks To Use Compaq Devices	In its effort to add the wireless Internet to its menu, the Starbucks Coffee Company announced a five-year, $100 million agreement with the Compaq Computer Corporation. Starbucks will equip its Seattle headquarters with Compaq computers, servers and storage systems, and make Compaq's hand-held computer, the iPaq, available for Starbucks customers to try the new high-speed wireless network in coffeehouses. The network, which Starbucks announced in January, uses a wireless technology called 802.11b. It will be available in coffeehouses in Seattle, San Francisco and Dallas this summer and in 70 percent of the company's North American stores within a year, Starbucks said. A spokeswoman said Starbucks would offer some content free, but might charge customers for more extensive use. Microsoft, through its online service, MSN, will create content and services intended for Starbucks customers. Chris Gaither (NYT)
4/29/2001	Surviving Starbucks	BUSINESS at David Nadelson's coffee shop, Aroma Coffee Roast, was on an upswing when it was confronted by Goliath right across the street: Starbucks Coffee. That was 1997, about four years after Mr. Nadelson opened Aroma, the first gourmet coffee shop in town, on Palmer Avenue. After putting in several years of long hours and hard work, Mr. Nadelson was feeling good. He hired staff. He had regular customers. He was even considering expanding.
4/27/2001	Starbucks Posts 38% Increase In Earnings	Starbucks said today that its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 38 percent after it raised prices and that sales this year would be less than forecast because consumers were reducing spending. The company's shares fell as much as 12 percent, to $35.22 in after-hours trading, after closing down 5 cents, to $39.68 on the Nasdaq stock market. Starbucks released earnings after the close of regular trading.
4/3/2001	Metro Business Briefing; DROP BOX DEAL DIES	Customers of Kozmo, the online delivery company based in Manhattan, will no longer be able to return videos to Starbucks Coffee locations, because a joint marketing agreement between the two companies has fallen apart. The agreement, which was signed on Feb. 12, 2000, ended on Sunday. The agreement called for Kozmo to pay $150 million to Starbucks in return for the coffee stores' serving as drop box locations. But after Kozmo officials decided to reduce the number of markets they served, instead of expanding as planned, they decided that $150 million was too much. Officials at the companies said they were unable to reach an amended agreement that would be viable for both sides. Jayson Blair
1/4/2001	Starbucks and Microsoft Plan Coffeehouse Web Access	The Starbucks Coffee Company and the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that they would join forces to offer wireless access to the Internet from Starbucks coffeehouses. The companies said they would work with the MobileStar Network Corporation of Richardson, Tex., which has already begun installing high-speed wireless connections in hotels and airports, catering to business travelers using e-mail and the World Wide Web.
12/17/2000	Big-Name Stores Elbow Onto Some Mom-and-Pop Streets	Cover your eyes, spin around a few times to disorient yourself, and open wide. Where are you? The signs say Court and Pacific and Dean and Amity Streets, but your eyes are telling you Upper West Side. Or perhaps Greenwich, Conn. Or maybe Chappaqua, N.Y. As of last weekend, Cobble Hill, a neighborhood once dominated by small, locally run shops, became home to a Ben & Jerry's and a Starbucks, both of which joined a mega-size CVS drugstore. And all on one block.
12/3/2000	Ideas & Trends	A year ago, demonstraters in Seattle ransacked a Starbucks Coffee store, venting their rage on that very visible symbol of globalization. Today, there are 566 Starbucks outlets in 18 foreign countries. There are also 15,751 McDonaldses in 119 foreign lands, as well innumerable Pizza Huts, KFC's, Dominoes, Burger Kings and other American fast food brands blanketing the globe. Surely, in an age when everybody eats and runs, this a wonderful thing? Not to all. Two months ago Starbucks set up shop in Beijing's Forbidden City, across from the former Imperial Palace. The Chinese, according to the official China Consumer Journal, were traumatized by this capitalist intrusion into a sacred space. '' 'God!' they exclaim, 'Not the Forbidden City,' '' reported the journal.
11/25/2000	Globalization Puts a Starbucks Into the Forbidden City in Beijing	Five million Chinese a year visit the ancient Forbidden City, walking across the acres of gray cobblestone, through the stately vermilion pavilions and beneath the orange glazed roof tiles of the capital's centuries-old palace complex. But just before they enter the Palace of Heavenly Purity, once the residence of China's emperors and still the symbolic center of the Chinese universe, they now see another color: the forest green logo of Starbucks Coffee.
10/18/2000	The Water Goes Up, The Coffee Comes Down, Piping Hot	Can a futuristic, slightly lopsided-looking, two-part plastic contraption be the key to good coffee? A vacuum coffee maker, called the Utopia, has just been introduced by Starbucks. It uses a method of brewing coffee that produces a truer, cleaner coffee flavor than a French press, a percolator or a filter drip pot. Vacuum coffee makers are usually complicated stove-top glass gadgets. The Starbucks model, made by Bodum, is electric and simpler to use. As water in the lower carafe is heated, it rises through a funnel to the top container, creating a vacuum in the lower carafe and saturating the ground coffee sitting on a filter screen in the top container. The finished brew then drops back through a filter screen into the lower carafe. The process takes about three minutes.
9/19/2000	Starbucks in European Venture Deal	Bon Appetit Group A.G., Switzerland's largest food wholesaler, said it had formed a joint venture with the Starbucks Corporation to open the first Starbucks store in Continental Europe. Bon Appetit's Passaggio unit will hold a majority stake in the venture, company executives said at a news conference. The first store opening is planned for Zurich next year.
8/2/2000	Times Company in Venture With Starbucks Coffee	The New York Times Company and the Starbucks Coffee Company said yesterday that they had agreed to the sale of The New York Times newspapers in Starbucks stores for three years in exchange for The Times's advertising promotion of Starbucks. Financial terms were not disclosed. The agreement calls for The Times to be sold at all American Starbucks stores. Some stores may also offer local newspapers and other national newspapers.
6/25/2000	Starbucks' Air-Conditioner Riles Up a Neighborhood	On weekend mornings, Juan Caicedo doesn't need to get out of bed to meet the brunch crowd. All he has to do is sit up, he said, ''and there are people sitting there, having their coffee, looking at me.'' Since the weather warmed up, neighbors of a new Starbucks coffee shop at Seventh Avenue and First Street say they have been disturbed by a rear seating area that looks into their backyards and an industrial-strength air-conditioner whose roar keeps them awake at night.
4/14/2000	Wake Up and Smell the Profits; A Singaporean Sees the World as His Coffee Cup	In the shadow of some dreary public housing developments, 16-year-old April Ong is whiling away another sweltering afternoon with friends at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf cafe, chatting about boys and nursing an icy coffee milkshake that cost the equivalent of $2.50. Only a few years ago, the fanciest coffee around here cost 40 cents and looked like motor oil cut with a dollop of Elmer's glue. This syrupy concoction can still be had at old-fashioned kopi tiams all over Singapore. But just as in America, teenagers like Ms. Ong and older upwardly mobile workers nowadays flock to trendy cafes to ponder dating or dot-coms over pricey coffee concoctions.
4/8/2000	Starbucks Founder Is Taking New Role	Howard Schultz, the founder, chairman and longtime chief executive of Starbucks Coffee, said on Thursday that he would take on a new role in the company. His replacement is the Starbucks chief operating officer, Orin Smith. Mr. Schultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 and has pledged to build 20,000 stores worldwide in the next few years, said he would become chief global strategist for the publicly traded company. He plans to remain chairman.
2/28/2000	For online businesses, alliances with bricks-and-mortar retailing chains promise many benefits.	A RECENT deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery specialist Kozmo.com -- in which Starbucks will essentially set aside space in its coffee shops for Kozmo -- may be the first example of an established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to an e-commerce company. But it is unlikely to be the last. Industry executives and analysts predict that such agreements will come rapidly in the next few months, as Internet retailers struggle to address two of their most glaring vulnerabilities -- customer acquisition costs and returns -- while continuing to close the gap between virtual and traditional stores.
2/20/2000	Killings in a Georgetown Coffee Shop Stir Death Penalty Debate	Federal prosecutors are pressing for the death penalty against a man charged with murdering three employees at a Starbucks coffee shop here in July 1997, clearing the way for the city's first death penalty case in nearly 30 years. In an outline issued this week, the prosecutors said they wanted to press a capital charge because the defendant has a history of violent crime. They said he shows no remorse and poses a continuing threat.
1/9/2000	Our Towns; A Downtown Too Decaf For Starbucks	AT first, it doesn't hit you. A stroll down Main Avenue reveals an ordinary, if aging, suburban downtown with a shoe repair shop, a couple of dry cleaners, a luncheonette here, a bakery there, a computer store. But soon you realize something is amiss. Terribly amiss. Your eyes sweep the streetscape, and you can hardly believe it. There's no Starbucks. In its manifest destiny to caffeinate America, Starbucks appears to have missed downtown Clifton. More curiously, when local officials and developers recently informed the Seattle-based company of its apparent oversight and invited them to open a cafe as part of a renovation project, Starbucks said thanks, but no thanks.
12/24/1999	Starbucks to Open 400 More Coffee Shops	Starbucks Corporation said today that it planned to spend about $300 million in its current fiscal year to open at least 400 coffee shops. Starbucks also spent $28.3 million to invest in two Internet ventures, Talk City Inc., which runs chat rooms, and Living.com Inc., which sells furniture and other products, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
9/12/1999	A Coffee Shop Folds and, No Surprise, It's Not a Starbucks	The problem at Ozzie's Coffee and Tea shop on Montague Street was two kinds of competition. For one, its owner, Allon Azulai, has two other coffeehouses vying for his attention. For another, there was a Starbucks only a block away, vying for his customers.
8/29/1999	A Big Chain Sips Away At the Competition	Last December the Starbucks coffee chain bought the Pasqua chain of coffee shops, which had 48 outlets in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and began changing the stores into Starbucks. One of the latest Pasqua stores to be transformed is the one at 51 Astor Place (at Third Avenue), which closed as Pasqua last Sunday and is to reopen tomorrow as a Starbucks. Gone is the Amalfi Espresso Blend ($9.50 a pound) and the Chillini, the low-fat coffee smoothie ($4.25 for a ''big shot''). In is the green Starbucks label, the Ethiopian Harrar ($9.95 a pound) and drinks like the Chai Tea Latte in sizes tall, grande and venti. However, Ahmed Helmy, who is continuing as manager, said the salads and other foods formerly offered would still be available.
8/27/1999	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS -- 'Begols' and 'Dirty Water'; Fast-Food Chains Take U.S. Marketing to Europe	Nobody knows when the custom began among travelers to Rome of turning your back to the Trevi Fountain and tossing in a coin over your left shoulder as a means of assuring your return. Do it these days, however, and you will probably spy, over to the left and a few steps up the narrow Via di San Vincenzo, a row of tan awnings labeled Dunkin' Donuts.

8/4/1999	Our Towns; In Stamford, Just Call It Starbooks	HILDA NICOLL may not be the last person in America to have become hip to Starbucks, but she surely was part of a select remnant. She lost her corporate-ubiquity innocence on a bench in front of the Stamford public library, the Ferguson Library, where she was sitting beneath a huge ''Coming Soon'' poster featuring the chain's circular logo of a smiling, two-tailed siren. ''Coffee?'' Mrs. Nicoll, 76, asked indignantly as she looked up toward the banner. ''Starbucks? I thought it was 'Star Wars.' '' Pause. ''This isn't a movie?''
7/11/1999	Starbucks Was Not Amused	The round green and white stickers can be spotted on skateboards and guitar cases in the East Village and on the Lower East Side, the image at first glance resembling the logo of the Starbucks coffee company. But what distinguishes these emblems from the ones that appear on cups and other items from Starbucks are the words around the border. Instead of ''Starbucks Coffee,'' the letters on these stickers make up a two-word directive that consists of the word ''off'' preceded by a common four-letter vulgarity.
7/2/1999	A Bitter Brew Of Earnings For Starbucks	Sipping his coffee at the Starbucks restaurant on Melrose Avenue here, Matt Siess said he loved the brew and the atmosphere. But he is skeptical about the coffee chain's new ambition to sell things beyond drinks and light food. ''I'm not sure what selling coffee has to do with selling Calphalon,'' he said. ''Ultimately, I guess, I think that most people that come here, come here to relax.''
6/26/1999	STARBUCKS BID FOR WILLIAMS-SONOMA IS REPORTED	The stock of the kitchenware retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc. jumped 17 percent yesterday after it was reported that the company had turned down a takeover offer earlier this month from the Starbucks Corporation. Shares of the San Francisco-based Williams-Sonoma closed at $34, up $5 each. The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffeehouse chain, was named by people ''close to the company'' as the bidder. No price was given. Neither company would comment on the report, and analysts cautioned against assuming that a deal would happen.
6/20/1999	Starbucks Tries to Make Friendly Entry Into Bronx	The Starbucks empire finally percolated into the Bronx last week when a branch opened at 314 East Fordham Road (at Kingsbridge Road). The nationwide chain that is behind this decade's coffee revival, specializing in espresso drinks and pastries with 70 stores around the city, has chartered an alliance with the Bronx Writers' Center in an effort to maintain an abiding relationship with the surrounding neighborhood.
5/16/1999	Big Blue, a Cup of Joe And a Little Perspective	EVERYBODY snickered last July when the Zapata Corporation, an obscure over-the-counter purveyor of fish byproducts, said that it was morphing into an Internet company. But when its stock more than doubled on the news, the snickerers went silent. If the gambit could propel shares of an unknown like Zapata, why not those of more established companies? Last week, the ''Internet, c'est moi'' strategy went big league. On Wednesday, shares in Starbucks, the trendy coffee emporium, hit a 52-week high when Scott Waltman, a Merrill Lynch analyst, reported that the company would announce an Internet strategy in June. Then, on Thursday, I.B.M.'s shares rocketed $20.50, or 9.1 percent, after the company's chairman, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., told analysts that a quarter of I.B.M.'s sales came from Internet-related businesses.
4/28/1999	A Caffe Latte Spot on West 125th Street	Starbucks Coffee Company, which has blanketed much of New York with scores of coffee stores with soft chairs and soft lighting, has teamed up with Magic Johnson to expand into a new market: Harlem. The Starbucks store, which is jointly owned by the company and Mr. Johnson, the basketball star turned entrepreneur, opened on Monday at 77 West 125th Street, at Lenox Avenue, one of the busiest spots in Harlem. The site, a former cigar store, has been vacant for months.

2/8/1999	Media Talk; A New Magazine, by Way of Starbucks	Time Inc. has joined forces with Starbucks, the coffeehouse giant responsible for caffeinating seven million Americans every week. The two companies will start publication this summer of Joe, a cultural review that will be sold in the 2,000 Starbucks stores sprinkled across the United States and Canada as liberally as the chocolate powder on top of a double-mocha half-caf cappuccino grande. Scott Mowbray, the managing editor of Joe, said that his editorial goal was to replicate the ideas and the conversation one encounters in a coffeehouse. To that end, the magazine's subtitle will be ''Life is Interesting. Discuss.'' If that sounds similar to the subtitle for Tina Brown's Talk -- hers is ''The American Conversation'' -- it is purely coincidental.
1/5/1999	Starbucks Has Disappointing December	The Starbucks Corporation, the largest American coffee retailer, said yesterday that sales at stores open at least a year rose only 1 percent in December on lower-than-expected sales of mugs, gift baskets and other holiday items. Starbucks, which operated 1,859 stores in North America and 146 overseas, had been expected to report so-called same-store sales gains of more than 5 percent for the five-week period ending on Dec. 27.
12/29/1998	Win One, Lose One For True North Unit	It was win one, lose one for the New York office of Foote, Cone & Belding, a unit of True North Communications, as the agency gained an assignment from a client while losing another. Foote, Cone was selected by the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies to develop advertising for its joint venture with the Starbucks Coffee Company, to distribute a line of Starbucks brand grocery products in supermarkets. Billings have not been determined.
10/13/1998	Starbucks Is Parting From BBDO West	The Starbucks Coffee Company said yesterday that after only 13 months, it had ended its relationship with BBDO West in Los Angeles. Billings on its account are estimated at $5 million to $10 million. ''We are in a transition period,'' Alan Gulick, a spokesman, said in confirming reports in Advertising Age and Adweek. ''We will be moving the business from BBDO West, but I have no more details to share.'' Tom Hollerbach, chief executive of BBDO West, part of Omnicom Group, declined to comment.
8/9/1998	POSTINGS: Starbucks-to-Go in an Office Lobby; First the Grind, Then the Grind	In what its marketing manager described as catering to a ''vertical neighborhood,'' the Starbucks Coffee Company is about to open its first coffee shop-newsstand in the lobby of a New York City office building -- at 1185 Avenue of the Americas -- with no direct access from the street. ''Our neighborhood is above us, the vertical neighborhood,'' said Paul Williams, the New York metropolitan area marketing manager for Starbucks. ''It will have a different relationship with our customers than most of our stores. Of course, people could come off the street through the lobby.''
7/5/1998	Starbucks Saved the City From a Lot of Bad Coffee	To the Editor: What proud coffee heritage? I have lived in New York City all my life and can't imagine what Carol Peace Robins is talking about. Coffee in New York's average coffee shop was mostly tasteless swill before Starbucks and their ilk came to town. I should know. I used to drink it by the gallon. And had the perpetual heartburn to prove it. Except at a meal at a few top restaurants or espresso in Little Italy, it was impossible to get a decent cup in New York. Certainly nothing compared to what was served in New Orleans, France or Italy.
7/5/1998	Starbucks Saved the City From a Lot of Bad Coffee	To the Editor: For those of us who lament the usually awful coffee available in most ''coffee shops'' where folks have breakfast, and even where decent lunches and dinners are served, the advent of Starbucks and half a dozen other excellent specialty coffee houses is a dream come true (Soapbox, ''Life Before Starbucks'' by Carol Peace Robins, June 14). If Ms. Robins isn't enough of a coffee maven, then she can continue visiting those locations where a full table is available to spread out her newspaper or books. But the brown water served as coffee in the settings she describes offer no competition when one can inhale the coffee aroma in Starbucks, in spite of the limited space.
6/17/1998	Food Stuff	Ripe, Red, Luscious And at the Greenmarkets Quarts of ripe, luscious strawberries from local farms were lined up at stands at the Union Square Greenmarket last week, and they should be available through early July. They were being sold for $3 a quart by Caradonna Farm of Marlboro, N.Y., Sycamore Farm of Middletown, N.Y., and Hodgson Farms of Newburgh, N.Y. Caradonna Farm offered two quarts for $5. Most of the other Greenmarkets in the city also have strawberries.
4/30/1998	NEWS WATCH	STARBUCKS ON THE WEB -- Hardly satisfied with conquering the downtown corners of practically every major city in North America, the Starbucks Coffee Company announced this week that it was setting its caffeine-widened gaze on the Internet.
4/27/1998	Technology Accounts Are Awarded on Friday	There were two decisions on Friday involving two technology-related accounts, for which the billings were not disclosed. The Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle named Organic in San Francisco as the first agency to handle its interactive account. The decision came after a two-and-a-half-month review that included nine other undisclosed agencies.
3/26/1998	Metro Business; Tenants for 55 Broad Street	Three food retailers have signed agreements to occupy the ground floor of 55 Broad Street, a building in lower Manhattan that is noted for its high-speed computer connections and preference for new-media tenants. Starbucks, Cosi Sandwich Bar and Daily Soup will occupy 2,500 square feet, 3,400 square feet and 1,200 square feet, respectively, in separate 10-year deals, said John J. Gilbert, chief operating officer of the Rudin Management Company, the building's owner.
11/16/1997	They're Everywhere. But They Didn't Used to Be.	1. BED, BATH AND BEYOND A 2,000-square-foot store that opened in Springfield in 1971 was the chain's first outpost in New Jersey. By the mid-80's, Springfield had a store of 50,000 square feet. Bed, Bath and Beyond now has nine locations in New Jersey, with at least two more opening in 1998. As of early November, it had a total of 138 stores in 28 states. 2. BARNES & NOBLE The chain opened its first New Jersey superstore on Route 17 North in Paramus in May 1991. It now has 17 superstores in the state, including one on Route 17 South, just a couple of miles from the original, which is still open. The company also has two smaller bookstores in New Jersey, in Shrewsbury and in West Orange. Nationwide, the company operates 462 Barnes & Nobles stores, as well as 554 branches of B. Dalton Booksellers.
9/12/1997	Account Changes By 3 Marketers	Three large marketers have changed agencies on their accounts, with combined billings estimated at $66 million to $70 million. The Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle and Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco said yesterday they would part ways after two years on an account with billings estimated at $10 million. Starbucks moved the account without a review to BBDO West in Los Angeles.
9/1/1997	History in a Hazelnut Shell	The summer of '97: Dairy Queen and A & W root beer floats are but faint memories, like sock hops and 30-cents gas. It's frappucino now. And macchiato. And Starbucks. And, perhaps, the end of the American empire.
7/8/1997	Three Workers Found Killed in Coffee Shop in Georgetown	Residents of one of the capital's wealthiest neighborhoods awoke this morning to learn that violent crime does not happen only in other parts of the city. Three employees of a Starbucks coffee shop on Wisconsin Avenue, a major thoroughfare in Georgetown, had been shot to death in the manager's office sometime after the store closed at 8 P.M. on Sunday, the authorities said. The bodies were found by an employee who arrived for work today shortly before dawn.
5/29/1997	Caffeine 'High' Rises Again at Starbucks	The Starbucks Corporation said yesterday that it would raise coffee prices at its shops around the nation for the second time this year, reflecting coffee's rising price worldwide. Starbucks, a Seattle-based specialty-coffee chain that has 1,200 stores, said it would raise prices for drip coffee by 5 cents a cup and for espresso by 10 cents a cup, starting tomorrow. It will also raise the price of whole bean coffee by 40 cents a pound.
2/22/1997	Operators of Juice Bars Hope to Match Success Of the Coffee Chains	First, there was frozen yogurt, which was transformed overnight from ice cream's poor cousin into an American snacking staple. Then, there was caffe latte, a treat once reserved for gondolas and exotic outposts and now the morning sustenance of construction workers. Can blue-green algae and Ginkgo biloba be far behind? The owners of Jamba Juice, a 45-store chain of juice bars serving up fresh and frothy beverage blends -- known in juice-business argot as smoothies -- are convinced that juice may be the hottest new food item since the Starbucks Corporation convinced the world it was a great idea to spend $2 for a cup of coffee. Here, the attraction is not a caffeine jolt, but the supposed healing powers of the mix-ins. (An extract from the leaf of the Ginkgo biloba, a tree common in China and Japan, is thought to strengthen the immune system; blue-green algae is added as a source of vitamin B12.) Nutrition experts dispute most of the health claims made for these ingredients but acknowledge that they are probably harmless.
1/18/1997	Forget Armageddon, Think Commercial Potential	Millennium fever is spreading through popular culture, and corporate America has caught the bug. Companies large and small figure that an event capable of inspiring apocalyptic novels, doomsday prophecies, $2,000 Jeroboams of wine and plans for 24-hour blowouts in the world's 24 time zones to ring in the year 2000 has got to have some sort of commercial potential.
12/8/1996	Corrections	A picture caption last Sunday with the View column, about coffee shops in Larchmont, misidentified a patron at Aroma Coffee. He was Eric Newland, not Ned Purves.
11/18/1996	The Companies Want to Know: Like a Little Cyber in Your Cafe?	First they put computers where we work, then they pushed computers where we live. Now, the computer companies are going after us where we eat and drink. Both the Intel Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. are planning to serve their computer technologies to a broader consumer market through technology-themed restaurants and coffee shops.
10/28/1996	On Road to Suburbia, a Town Loses Its Charm	To the Editor: I am dismayed by your Oct. 23 news article on Starbucks' threat to the character of the Westchester County community of Katonah. I'm not sure I care whether we have a Starbucks, but I do know that the tone and substance of the resistance to it make me sad.
10/27/1996	Half Caf, Half Decaf . . .	UNTIL a few years ago, there were several places in my town where you could go for coffee. Where you went depended on lots of factors, among them your age, income, political orientation and general outlook on life, as well as whether you smoked. Never mind who patronized which shops. Now that not one but two Starbucks have settled into the landscape, everyone goes to them.
10/23/1996	Westchester Hamlet Fears an Invasion by Starbucks	While other communities may gird themselves against the arrival of commercial behemoths like Home Depot or Price Club, here the enemy is relatively small, seemingly innocuous and even coveted in many corners of suburbia. The adversary in Katonah is Starbucks, the java giant that acts like the Gap, spawning new stores faster than customers can request ''a grande skim half-regular half-decaf cappuccino.''
7/14/1996	F.Y.I.	Big Whale, Strong Java
7/14/1996	F.Y.I.	Big Whale, Strong Java Q. Re the Starbuck's invasion: Where does the chain get its name? I seem to remember a character on the short-lived television show ''Battlestar Galactica'' . . . A. Not the Galactica, but another doomed boat. Starbuck's was founded in 1971 by three graduate students in English literature, and takes its omnipresent title from ''Moby Dick,'' Herman Melville's very famous, very long book about whales. Starbuck, you may remember, was the Pequod's chief mate, a ''long, earnest man'' whose premonitions about Captain Ahab prove tragically apt.
9/30/1995	SHARES OF STARBUCKS FALL ON HIGHER COFFEE COSTS	Shares of the Starbucks Corporation shares fell 11.7 percent yesterday after the company said it would feel the effects of higher coffee costs in its 1996 fiscal year, which begins next month. But, the company, which is based in Seattle, said it remains comfortable with earnings estimates of 95 cents to $1 a share for its 1996 fiscal year. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of 72 cents a share for the year ending Monday, according to a survey by First Call Inc. Earnings for the 1994 fiscal year were 34 cents a share.
9/14/1995	Beer and Coffee In One Bottle	"The Starbucks Corporation and Redhook Ale Brewery Inc. have joined forces to brew Double Black Stout, a dark roasted malt beer brewed by Redhook with the added flavor of Starbucks coffee. The brew will have 30 milligrams of caffeine per 22-ounce bottle, a quarter the strength of a cup of regular drip coffee. Beer ordinarily has no caffeine. """"It's not going to replace cappuccino or Irish coffee, but a brewery the size of Redhook introducing a beer like this is a good indication it may become a bigger thing than most people would expect,"""" said David Edgar, the director of the Institute for Brewing Studies in Boulder, Colo. While the venture is the first time coffee-flavored beer has been brought to market on such a large scale, Mr. Edgar said, a small chain of brew pubs in Oregon first brewed the combination. Starbucks, a retailer and roaster of specialty coffee with more than 650 stores, also recently released Mazagran coffee soda in a joint venture with Pepsico Inc. Starbucks and Redhook are based in Seattle."
7/26/1995	Accounts Awarded For Starbucks, 7Up	Two marketers formally awarded their accounts yesterday to agencies that had been expected to land those assignments. Cadbury Beverages North America, a unit of Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. in Stamford, Conn., named the New York office of Young & Rubicam Inc. as the agency of record for its 7Up line of sodas, with billings estimated at $25 million to $30 million. The account had been at the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago for the last decade until Burnett resigned on May 31 to handle the Fruitopia line of fruit and tea drinks for the Coca-Cola Company.
7/13/1995	Starbucks Review Narrowed to Goodby	The Starbucks Coffee Company said yesterday that it had further narrowed a three-month review on its account to Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, which will make a final presentation in the next two weeks. The account, with billings estimated at $7 million, had been at the Evans Group in Seattle for the last five years until Starbucks and Evans agreed to part ways in April.
6/28/1995	Just Not Right	"To The Living Section: If the worst thing that ever happens to Jeremy Dorosin (""""Customer Is Always Right, Right?"""" June 14) is having Starbucks Coffee Company send his friend a defective espresso machine and then amend its mistake by sending two new machines, coffee, a steaming pitcher, condiment shakers, cups and saucers and a $30 refund plus letters of apology, he is a very lucky man indeed."
6/25/1995	Starbucks Pours It On	"WITH designer coffee bars on almost every corner, terms like """"slim grande"""" and """"short latte"""" have become regular staples of the city's lexicon. But the coffee bar business itself is far from settled. In the last year, the national chain Starbucks has descended on the city, opening in 15 locations, with another very likely to be coming soon to a corner near you. And, in the Darwinian economics of New York's storefront marketplace, the chic coffee bars that only recently displaced the old-time coffee shops are now concerned about being bullied out of business themselves."
6/21/1995	Customers Right or Wrong	"To The Living Section: Jeremy Dorosin is not my idea of a consumer hero [ """"Customer Is Always Right, Right?"""" June 14 ] . Although I can understand his outrage at being sold used or malfunctioning appliances, Mr. Dorosin's demands far outweigh his problems. I fail to see the relationship between a faulty espresso machine and a center for runaway children."
6/14/1995	Customer Is Always Right, Right?	JEREMY DOROSIN, of Walnut Creek, Calif., says all he wanted in the beginning was a decent cup of coffee. Now, he says, he just wants what he considers decency. Contending that a Starbucks coffee store in Berkeley, Calif., sold him two defective espresso machines and then failed to make proper amends, Mr. Dorosin has, in a monthlong public campaign for reparation, spent more than $10,000 on newspaper advertisements and a toll-free telephone number, soliciting other dissatisfied customers. The four advertisements, in regional editions of The Wall Street Journal, have generated a wellspring of support and become a public relations problem for the Starbucks Coffee Company, the nation's largest chain of coffee stores.
4/17/1995	Starbucks Ends Link With Evans Group	The Starbucks Coffee Company and the Evans Group in Seattle have agreed to end their relationship after five years as Starbucks seeks a larger agency as it grows nationally and internationally. As a result, Starbucks will begin a review on its account, with billings estimated at $7 million.
4/12/1995	Pepsico Coffee Drink Seen	The Starbucks Coffee Company and Pepsico Inc. will start testing their first carbonated coffee drink next month, according to an industry newsletter. The test will be conducted in Southern California, unidentified bottlers told Beverage Digest in the publication's issue yesterday. Starbucks, which is based in Seattle, is in an eight-month-old joint venture with Pepsico, based in Purchase, N.Y.
4/2/1995	NEW YORKERS & CO.	Something's Percolating On Astor Place The coffee chains continue to caffeinate the city.
3/29/1995	Business Travel; At some big-city hotels, new rules mean it's harder to make last-minute changes in plans.	A NUMBER of large hotels in major American cities are imposing charges for failing to cancel guaranteed reservations at least 72 hours before arrival, or for checking out earlier than planned. Many hotels in Washington, including the Washington Hilton and Towers, recently began requiring that if guests with guaranteed reservations changed plans, they must notify the hotel 72 hours before the original arrival time, or pay for one night's stay. (Such penalties are standard at resort properties, but are new at business hotels, many of which had required cancellation by 6 P.M. on the day of arrival.)
3/12/1995	Iambic Pentameter Trips Over an Ordinance Covering Zoning	When Starbucks, the Seattle-based company that helped start a gourmet coffee revolution, opened a coffee shop along the main street here in June, it became an immediate success. Shoppers ran in for a quick cappuccino or lingered over a single espresso. But when the coffeehouse decided to sponsor monthly poetry readings, it became the focus of a winter-long battle over a city zoning code that bans live entertainment.
1/10/1995	Hal Riney Wins Pepsi-Starbucks Job	The Pepsi-Cola Company in Somers, N.Y., and the Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle said yesterday that they had selected Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco as the first agency to handle advertising for their new Pepsi-Starbucks Coffee Partnership, which will begin selling ready-to-drink coffee-based beverages in the spring. Though the billings have not been determined, they could reach $15 million to $20 million.
12/14/1994	COFFEE TALK WITH: Howard Schultz; By Way of Canarsie, One Large Hot Cup of Business Strategy	"THE man at the end of the line is fed up. """"I hate this place,"""" he says. """"It's expensive and crowded and I can't speak the language. What is espresso macchiato, anyway?"""" Actually, it's espresso with foamed milk, but no one at Starbucks calls it that. They also don't use words like """"small"""" or """"large"""" when """"tall"""" and """"grande"""" will do. But their funny vocabulary aside, the employees at Starbucks, the Seattle-based chain that is rapidly expanding into New York, are known for being cheerful, well mannered and efficient. Some are so clean cut they look as if they just shoveled a neighbor's walk. They are in direct contrast to the staffs at New York's home-grown coffee bars, like French Roast in Greenwich Village, where the morning servers seem to have made the supreme sacrifice of stopping in on their way home from the clubs."
10/30/1994	In the Region/Westchester; Coffee Bars Bringing New Life to Downtown Areas	SEVERAL downtown areas in the county have been jolted out of their somnolence lately by the opening of coffee bars, those bistro-like establishments that serve espresso, cappuccino and other specialty coffees. A fairly new phenomenon in Westchester, the bars have been enlivening downtown streets, especially during evening hours, when previously there had been little activity. On any given night in the village of Bronxville, for instance, young people in trendy clothes can be seen trooping down Pondfield Road on their way to Slave to the Grind, a 16-month-old coffee bar.
7/31/1994	The View From: Rye;Coffee Bars Are Gathering Speed on the Espresso Lane	"FROM their respective picture windows, the staffs of the Coffee Tree and Starbucks Coffee can see the comings and goings of each other's clientele. The Coffee Tree and Starbucks are across the street from each other -- Coffee Tree is at 44 Purchase Street, Starbucks at 51 -- and sometimes it's just too tempting not to check out the competition. As for the customers, as one put it, """"It's free enterprise -- the American way."""" Two gourmet coffee bars, not just in one town, not just on the same street, but within 30 feet of each other simply means more goodies to choose from. Coffee in the 1990's has become like wine, something to sip, savor and analyze, something that comes in a bewildering variety of flavors and aromas. Coffee is for connoisseurs these days and, it seems, just about everyone is a connoisseur."
6/8/1994	Starbucks	Starbucks, the fast-growing coffee bar company in Seattle, saw its share price drop yesterday as it announced an accelerated and presumably costlier expansion plan for the year ending in September 1995. It plans to open 200 stores, up from 165. It now has 364 stores and plans to add 150 in its current fiscal year.
4/30/1994	Getting the Most out of Stock Options	Patti Brooks earns a living serving steamy caffe lattes, iced double espressos and other brews at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Seattle suburb of Lynnwood. But the cream in her coffee is a company fringe benefit: stock options. Like all Starbucks employees, she annually receives stock options equal to 10 percent of her salary under the company's Bean Stock program begun in 1991. Those options give her the right to buy Starbucks stock at a fixed price.
3/18/1994	Market Place; Starbucks buys the java and Au Bon Pain suffers caffeine jitters.	TRADERS and caffeine go hand in hand. So they can be forgiven if they were a little too quick on the trigger Tuesday, when the Starbucks Corporation, a Seattle-based chain of specialty coffee shops, announced that it was buying Coffee Connection Inc., the purveyor of a competitive brew. Coffee Connection, of Boston, is privately owned. But the news sent Starbucks stock soaring 10.1 percent to close at $24.50 by day's end, and the deal seemed to be why a Boston-based competitor, Au Bon Pain, lost 3.1 percent of its market value that day, closing at $23.50. Yesterday, Starbucks closed at $24.25 and Au Bon Pain at $23.50.
3/16/1994	STARBUCKS PLANS TO ACQUIRE COFFEE CONNECTION	The Starbucks Corporation, a 300-store, specialty coffee chain based in Seattle, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Coffee Connection Inc. for an undisclosed amount of newly issued Starbucks common shares. The purchase of Coffee Connection, based in Boston, would speed the expansion plans of Starbucks into the East Coast market. Coffee Connection has 22 stores in three states. Shares of Starbucks rose $2.25, to $24.50, on Nasdaq. Separately, the Chock Full o'Nuts Corporation, based in New York City, said it had acquired Boston-based Quikava, which operates four specialty coffee, baked goods and snack kiosks, with another under construction.
1/18/1994	A Delicate Balance for a Coffee Chain	"George Howell is Juan Valdez in a blue blazer, so obsessed with finding quality coffee that he is said to spend hours each day cupping, or tasting, new roasts from around the world. With a sharp sniff and a quick slurp, he can tell a Kenyan Kangocho from a Jamaican Blue Mountain. And that discriminating taste is what brings some customers miles out of their way to his Coffee Connection stores, for beans by the pound and coffee by the cup. """"He's the best there is,"""" said Erna Knutsen, a San Francisco-based coffee importer who sells beans to Coffee Connection, which has 22 stores, mostly in the Boston area. """"He never compromises on anything. He never asks me the price; he only wants quality. That's why he's succeeded."
10/7/1993	Starbucks to Taste New York, at Last	The Starbucks Corporation, the nation's largest retailer of specialty coffee, is expected to announce on Thursday that it is moving farther from its base here into several new Eastern markets -- including New York City and Boston. The company, which has aggressively expanded, now has 253 stores in the United States. It features Italian-style coffee bars selling fresh-roasted beans, pots to brew them in, and drinks like latte (pronounced LAH-tay), a shot of espresso topped with hot milk but less foamy than cappuccino.
8/16/1992	At Work; Benefits? For Part Timers?	"Part-time employees tend to be the stepchildren of the American labor force. Though they are students, retired people, parents and others who want flexibility, they are also, increasingly, full-time-worker wannabees bumped down to part-time status by companies looking to save money on benefits. Except at the Starbucks Coffee Company, which takes the apparently counterintuitive approach that all employees, whether part time or full, are a resource rather than a liability. The Seattle-based specialty-coffee roaster and retailer is coming up on the second anniversary of a program offering a full plate of benefits to its 2,000 or so full- and part-time workers. The strategic logic of corporations that """"discriminate"""" against part timers is flawed, said Howard Schultz, Starbucks's chief executive. """"We view them, at a minimum, as on an equal footing with full-timers."
5/28/1992	Market Place; A Coffee Trend Is Going Public	IS Wall Street ready to wake up and smell the cappuccino? The Starbucks Corporation, better known as the Starbucks Coffee Company, thinks so. Last week, Starbucks announced an initial public offering of 2.1 million shares of common stock, priced at $14 to $16. The offering, the first by a specialty coffee retailer, is being co-managed by Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. and Wertheim Schroder & Company.
