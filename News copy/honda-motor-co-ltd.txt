2006-11-07	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Foreign Investments Approved	India has approved 32 foreign investment proposals worth 2.5 billion rupees ($56 million), the largest an investment of 1.4 billion rupees ($31 million) by the Walt Disney Company in United Home Entertainment, a leading entertainment company that runs the popular Hungama television channel for children. The proposals, which were approved by the finance ministry, also included investments by Honda Motor and the Volvo Group. Honda plans to set up a subsidiary to manage its spare parts and business planning operations. Volvo plans to set up a joint venture with the auto maker Jaico Automobile Engineering to produce 1,000 bus bodies annually. SARITHA RAI (NYT)

2006-06-11	Hyundai Hits a Speed Bump	IT is daunting enough to mount a direct challenge to the likes of Toyota and Honda, but Hyundai's quest to join the top ranks of global automakers has been complicated by the legal troubles of its chairman in Korea and by turbulence in the top ranks of its American operations. No longer a late-night punch line, the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group now ranks No. 6 in worldwide sales, according to Automotive News, a trade publication. And Hyundai was already one of the world's fastest-growing major automakers when it opened an assembly plant -- its first American factory -- in Montgomery, Ala., in 2005. Cars from Hyundai and its Kia subsidiary, which not long ago were cellar dwellers in the quality and reliability ratings of J. D. Power & Associates and other survey firms, have shown steady improvement. Some have even achieved best-in-class status.

A scooter like the Yamaha Vino Classic will do even better - it is capable of 115 m.p.g. But the tiny Vino, while fine for local errands, would be hard-pressed to fill a full range of transportation needs.
2006-04-18	A Car Campaign Takes Some Alternate Routes	THE Marshall McLuhan proclamation that ''the medium is the message'' is being taken to heart by the American Honda Motor Company for the introduction of a subcompact intended for drivers who live in cities. A campaign scheduled to begin Thursday for the new car, a five-door hatchback called the Honda Fit, makes media choices meant to help consumers sort themselves as, well, fit or unfit for Fit, which will compete against models like the Chevrolet Aveo, Kia Rio, Nissan Versa, Scion xA and Toyota Yaris. The Fit campaign has a budget estimated at $20 million to $30 million, typical for a new car.
2006-04-16	Life in the Green Lane	IF you make your way over to the Javits Convention Center for the New York International Automobile Show -- or if you've gone to any auto show in the last year or so -- you'll know that hybrid cars are the hippest automotive fashion statement to come along in years. They've become synonymous with the worthy goal of reducing gasoline consumption and dependence on foreign oil and all that this means for a better environment and more stable geopolitics. And yet like fat-free desserts, which sound healthy but can still make you fat, the hybrid car can make people feel as if they're doing something good, even when they're doing nothing special at all. As consumers and governments at every level climb onto the hybrid bandwagon, there is the very real danger of elevating the technology at the expense of the intended outcome -- saving gas.
2006-04-09	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2007 Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris; Small but Tasty Portions For a Land of Gluttony	ATTENTION, Americans: This is a test. Now that even President Bush has pronounced the nation ''addicted to oil,'' and even as hybrid-car sales boom while S.U.V.'s swoon, here come new opportunities to test your willingness to use less gasoline. You can now drive the latest wave of smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles, the so-called ''B class'' cars that are popular in most of the rest of the world. Two fine examples are the Toyota Yaris, which went on sale a few weeks ago, and the Honda Fit, which becomes available next week. Set aside any lingering pint-size prejudices -- these new subcompacts are not stripped-down penalty boxes like the economy cars of yesteryear. They are neither cramped nor bereft of creature comforts. They are even a bit stylish.
2006-04-02	Hybrids for Ozzie and Harriet	RELIABLE, practical and popular, the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry are as mainstream as white bread and as exciting as mom's meatloaf. But hybrid technology has transformed versions of these family cars from conservative appliances into cutting-edge green machines. Having redesigned the Camry for 2007, Toyota joins Honda in offering a midsize sedan with a hybrid gas-electric powertrain. Honda, meanwhile, has freshened and mildly restyled its Accords, including the hybrid.
2006-03-12	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Honda Civic; Once Strait-Laced, Now Spacey	LIKE Kobe Bryant on an N.B.A. points binge, Honda has been lighting up the scoreboard. A jury of auto writers voted the 2006 Civic the North American Car of the Year. Motor Trend named it Car of the Year, as did The Detroit News. ''MotorWeek,'' on public television, anointed it Best of the Year. The Civic got awards from AutoWeek, Autobytel, Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book, among others. It made Consumer Reports' top picks list.
2006-03-02	Both Ford And G.M. Scale Back	Both General Motors and Ford said Wednesday they would scale back production in the second quarter, a move that reflects their falling sales and shrinking market share in the United States. As has been the case for much of the last year, Asian automakers' sales grew steadily last month. Honda's sales rose the most, with an 8.7 percent increase. Toyota, which has become accustomed to double-digit monthly gains, had a more modest 2.4 percent increase last month.
2006-02-19	Editors' Note	An article on Feb. 5 about changes in the American auto market contrasted its two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford, with the next four -- Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Nissan. It said that while those four were expected to have a combined worldwide profit of $22 billion for 2005, G.M. and Ford together had a loss of $6.6 billion worldwide. The article should have noted that G.M. reported a loss of $8.6 billion while Ford reported an overall profit of $2 billion, although Ford lost $1.6 billion from its North American auto operations.
2006-02-05	Carmakers' Big Idea: Think Small	THE writer E. F. Schumacher would be proud. Across the automobile market in America, there is an evolving realization that small is beautiful. No longer do the industry's two biggest companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, dominate the industry -- not in profits, sales or buzz. The hottest action is now taking place among the next four companies: Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, and the Japanese automakers Toyota, Honda and Nissan.

Consider some small sporting cars:
2005-11-07	Minivans Safer With Side Air Bags	A new method of crash-testing minivans showed that Honda, Nissan and Toyota models are among the safest when struck by a sport utility vehicle or a pickup truck, according to a report released Sunday. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety assessed the safety of six minivans by simulating a crash in which an S.U.V. or a pickup truck slammed into the side of the minivan at 31 miles an hour. The tests involved only new models that were not going to be redesigned by the manufacturer in the near future.

''When the cars pull up to me, the Porsches and the Bentleys and all that, I just sort of say, well, that's nice, but for what this costs I could buy 10 of those,'' said Mr. Spallino, while driving up Interstate 405, the freeway from his office in Irvine toward his home in Redondo Beach.
2005-10-23	Buckled Up and Free	WOMAN, in case you had not heard, is not a vessel. But Woman has been poured, packed and trussed into some mighty constraining containers over the years, from the figure-flattening boned bodices of Elizabethan England to the figure-flattering Wonderbras and stilettos of the 1990's. And when it comes to helming vessels, Woman has often found herself skipper of that slow boat to suburbia: the S.S. Station Wagon, a weighty skow practically synonymous with women's lack of lib.
2005-10-04	Big S.U.V.'s Lag in Sales, Hindered By Gas Cost	The heyday of the giant sport utility vehicle keeps moving farther away as gasoline prices loom larger. In September, industrywide sales of large S.U.V.'s were down 43 percent from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. That is particularly bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which are dependent on truck-based S.U.V.'s.

Yet the Honda Civic GX may be the most provocative car to ply California's polluted, congested freeways this year. Neither a sophisticated hybrid nor a fuel cell vehicle designed for hydrogen highways of the future, the Civic GX doesn't run on canola oil, turkey renderings, subatomic particles or even electricity. Instead, it makes its idosyncratic way on cheap, clean-burning, abundant natural gas.
2005-07-28	Net Profit Slips at Honda, But Global Sales Increase	Profit at Honda Motor fell 3.1 percent in the latest quarter on derivatives losses, but sales rose in all its major markets and the company raised its profit outlook for the financial year. Honda, the third-largest automaker in Japan, said net profit slipped to 111 billion yen ($1.02 billion) in the three months through June. The drop was largely a result of losses in financial derivatives Honda had bought to hedge against currency risk.
2005-07-10	A Big Load of Zip and Noise for Just 50 Pounds of Bike	SPEEDY, high-styled and low-slung, the minimotorcycles known as pocket rockets are hot sellers. But along with these bikes, most of them imports, have come complaints about safety and quality that have caught the attention of many police departments and lawmakers around the nation. Typically priced at $200 to $500 and with engines whose intense whine would endear them to the Wild One, the machines are miniature versions of brawnier bikes that cost many thousands of dollars. That is a combination that many consumers find irresistible.
2005-07-04	Honda's Gold Wing Goes the Distance	FOR many adventurous travelers, there is no better way to answer the call of the open road than climbing aboard a motorcycle. Romantic notions aside, though, two-wheelers have not always been well suited to long-distance journeys. With little protection from the weather and scant accommodations for carrying spare clothes and other necessities, motorcycles have traditionally required a deep commitment on the part of far-ranging riders. High maintenance -- daily chain adjustments, to name just one regular chore -- further tested a rider's resolve.
2005-07-03	The Car Is for Kids, But Gramps Is Driving	THE next time traffic snaps to a halt in a spectacle of brake lights, glance around. There's a good chance you'll see one of those cool hipster-mobiles -- the coupes with erector-set spoilers, the hatchbacks in emphatic colors, the boxy wagons that seem more square than a 1950's sitcom. These sorts of trendy cars, like the Toyota Matrix, the Honda Element and three varieties of Toyota's Scions, were designed and marketed expressly for 20-somethings. But the people at the wheel often look more like Ozzie and Harriet than like the serially pierced offspring of Ozzy Osbourne.
2005-06-25	Next Wave From China: Exporting Cars to the West	Honda Motor began loading cars onto a ship here on Friday for export to Europe in China's debut as a volume exporter of cars to the industrialized world. The shipment follows DaimlerChrysler's disclosure two months ago at the Shanghai Auto Show that it was negotiating to build a factory near Beijing to make small cars for export to North America. It comes at the end of a week when the Haier Group's bid for Maytag and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's bid for Unocal have fed Western concerns about China's rapid economic rise.
2005-06-22	Shifting Michigan Southward; Foreign Automakers, Settled in South, Set Industry's Pace	By most accounts, the United States auto industry is in deep trouble. But don't tell that to the newest workers here in Alabama, where foreign carmakers are redefining the auto industry in America. Automakers from overseas first began building manufacturing plants in this country in the 1970's, largely as a defensive response to protectionist threats. But even as General Motors and Ford have been announcing thousands of job cuts, the foreign automakers are aggressively building new factories and expanding plants they opened not long ago.
2005-06-17	Street Ready, For Tokyo, That Is	JASON PHAM has spent about $30,000 and endless hours scouring the Internet for parts for his used Honda Civic hatchback. But there are no flames crawling up the side of the vehicle or multiple plasma-screen TV's inside to make it stand out. His goal was to make his car look like other vehicles on the road -- in Japan. ''I didn't want a car everyone else was building,'' he says. Mr. Pham, a 20-year-old from Fairfax, Va., has swapped out everything from his headlights to his oil cap for replacements from Japan. Just last month, he moved his steering wheel from left- to right-hand drive to simulate the Japanese driving experience. He even has a Japanese driver's manual that he bought on eBay for $35.
2005-06-05	What a Gas! A Week in Suburbia With a Hydrogen Honda	FOR a decade or longer, the fuel-cell car has resembled the mirage that recedes as you draw closer to it. Hydrogen-powered vehicles always seemed at least 20 years away, the subject of news conferences in Washington and static displays at auto shows. Even when test-drive opportunities came up, they were strictly controlled rides around a track, with nervous company representatives making excuses from the passenger seat. All that changed last month when Honda handed me the keys to a 2005 edition of its FCX (for Fuel Cell Experimental), the first zero-emission, hydrogen-driven vehicle to be certified by both the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of California for everyday commercial use. This is a street-ready hydrogen car with license plates and no rough edges, a test bed for green technology worth well over $1 million.
2005-05-17	Toyota Is Said to Plan a Gas-Electric Camry	Toyota Motor is set to announce Tuesday that it plans to build a gas-electric hybrid version of its top-selling Camry sedan, people briefed on the company's plans said on Monday. The hybrid Camry, to be built at Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., plant, would be the company's first gas-electric vehicle to be produced in the United States.
2005-04-27	U.S. Sales Help Honda Profit Increase 27%	Profit at the Honda Motor Company increased 27 percent in the most recent quarter as strong sales of Odyssey minivans and Acura RL luxury sedans in the United States helped offset revenue lost to unfavorable currency swings. In its earnings report on Tuesday, Honda warned, however, that profit would probably slip in the year ahead, echoing the cautious tone that a rival, Nissan, sounded a day earlier. Japanese carmakers are worried about the rising prices of gasoline and of crucial materials like steel.
2005-04-17	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2006 Honda Ridgeline; Ikea or Bust: A Pickup Dares To Try On A White Collar	THERE'S a saying in Texas, ''The bigger the buckle, the smaller the ranch.'' There were plenty of big belt buckles in the commercial that introduced the 2006 Ridgeline pickup, and the largest was one bearing Honda's logo. Does this suggest that Ridgeline owners are likely to own smallish ranches? More than likely, they won't own any.

2005-04-02	U.S. Automakers Lose Ground to Rivals	Auto sales perked up in March, though domestic carmakers continued to lose ground to foreign competitors. Sales at General Motors fell 1.5 percent and were down 4.9 percent at Ford Motor from the month a year earlier, while Nissan Motor reported a 12.6 percent increase, the first time the company had sold more than 100,000 cars and trucks in the United States in a month.
2005-03-19	Honda Tries to Spruce Up a Stodgy Image	At last month's Chicago Auto Show, the Honda Motor Company offered reporters a sneak preview of a Civic coupe. The car will not be available for sale until the fall, however, and for Honda executives that cannot come soon enough. A look at recent sales figures for the current Civic shows why. After slumping 9.3 percent in January from a year earlier, Civic sales in the United States plummeted 34 percent in February, compared with February 2004. And analysts say sales of the vehicle, Honda's second-most popular after the Accord, could continue to slide through the summer.
2005-03-02	G.M. and Ford Lose Ground In Sales Again	The gears of the domestic auto industry are grinding again, with shares of General Motors and the Ford Motor Company trading near one-year lows and the companies continuing to lose customers. Sales at G.M. fell 12.6 percent in February from the same month a year earlier, according to monthly sales reports released by automakers on Tuesday; Ford's sales fell 2.8 percent. Both companies scaled back the numbers of cars and trucks they planned to make as unsold models accumulate on dealer lots, though G.M.'s cut were deeper and it is showing few signs of a turnaround.
2005-02-26	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Executive Changes At Honda	The Honda Motor Company said Koichi Amemiya, the longtime head of its United States operation, would retire in June as part of widespread changes in its executive ranks. Honda will promote its head of finance, Satoshi Aoki, left, to replace Mr. Amemiya, 64, as executive vice president, the second-most powerful post behind the chief executive, Takeo Fukui. Mr. Aoki, a 36-year Honda veteran, will serve as chief financial officer, pending shareholder approval of the changes in June. Honda said Koichi Kondo, 58, a managing director with experience in overseas markets, will take charge of Honda's business in the United States. Mr. Kondo was already one of Honda's top executives in the United States. Honda also said it would reduce its board to 21 members, from 36, to streamline decision making. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2005-02-05	Honda Urges Toughening Of Fuel-Economy Rules	Honda Motor urged the federal government on Friday to impose tougher fuel- economy regulations, an unheard- of request from an automaker. The request was meant as a gesture to environmental groups after the Thursday decision by Honda and Nissan to join an industry lawsuit against California, which is seeking to regulate the emissions from cars and trucks of gases that are said to worsen global warming. Most other automakers have already sued the state to block what would be the first such effort in the nation.
2005-02-02	In a Tough Month for Autos, Ford Takes the Biggest Fall	Month after month, Detroit continues to lose American customers to Asian competitors. Last month, it was the Ford Motor Company that lost the most, with sales falling 4.9 percent in January compared with the same month a year earlier, Ward's AutoInfoBank reported Tuesday. And financial analysts are beginning to worry about the sales pace of some of Ford's new products.
2005-01-29	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda Forecasts Higher Profit	The Honda Motor Company reported net earnings of 150.8 billion yen ($1.5 billion) for the quarter ended in December, nearly unchanged from a year earlier, but raised its forecast for the full year on strong sales in China and the benefits of cost-cutting. The carmaker forecast that net income would rise 3.4 percent, to 480 billion yen ($4.7 billion), for the year ending March 31, up from the company's earlier estimate of 447 billion yen. Honda has been rapidly expanding production of Accord sedans and a compact hatchback in the fast-growing Chinese market. The company expects its sales in China to increase by a third this year. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2005-01-05	3 Japanese Carmakers Gain Against Big 3 in the U.S.	For Japanese automakers, last year brought feast or famine in the United States. Toyota, Honda and Nissan's American sales continued to surge in December, according to figures released Tuesday by the automakers, as the companies made further inroads against the Big Three domestic manufacturers, particularly General Motors and Ford Motor.
2004-12-25	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda To Sell Subcompact Car In U.S.	The Honda Motor Company will sell an inexpensive subcompact car, smaller than its Civic sedan, in the United States to compete with a growing list of new small cars from Japan. The car would be based on Honda's Fit hatchback, the best-selling car in Japan. The Fit is priced from $11,000 in Japan. Honda did not say when the car would go on sale in the United States. Toyota introduced its Scion line of subcompact cars in 2003, and Nissan Motor is planning to introduce a new subcompact model in 2007. Japan's carmakers have extensive lineups of subcompact cars in Japan and Europe but have been reluctant to offer them in the United States because of concerns they would be too small for American tastes. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-12-21	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda Forecasts Rising Sales	The Honda Motor company said it expected its global vehicle sales to rise 8 percent for 2005, to 3.4 million vehicles from 3.16 million vehicles in 2004. That would be about the same pace of growth as in 2004, when Honda's global sales rose 8.6 percent from 2003. Honda expects strong sales overseas to drive growth and plans to increase overseas production by 11 percent, to 2.15 million automobiles. Honda has been expanding production in the United States and China over the last year to keep up with demand for its vehicles. The company is counting on its first light truck and a revamped version of its Civic sedan to help it reach a goal of increasing sales in North America by 5 percent in 2005, to 1.45 million vehicles.

2004-12-16	Honda's Robot Advances, but to Where?	The Honda Motor Corporation introduced a new version of its humanoid robot that can jog, find its way around obstacles and respond to human touch. Developers of the robot, which looks like a child in an astronaut suit and is named Asimo, say the new model is a significant advance over earlier versions and brings them closer to a bipedal machine that can move on its own through homes and offices and interact naturally with humans.
2004-12-12	Fuel Cells in the Deep Freeze	AMONG the many hurdles to be overcome before we're all driving fuel-cell cars with exhaust that is baby's-breath-pure -- superyacht purchase prices, an almost nonexistent refueling network and some public concern about the wisdom of carrying hydrogen pressurized at 10,000 pounds per square inch -- is a more basic challenge: winter. Fuel cells work by producing electricity from hydrogen, with water as a byproduct. The electricity powers a motor that propels the car.
2004-12-10	Subtle Systems To Cut Noise	IN a world obsessed with cellphone ring tones and plugged in to iPods, simple silence can be precious. That's the reasoning behind Honda's two new and very similar noise-reducing systems. New this year in the 2005 Honda Odyssey (the first minivan to carry a noise-reducing system), the 2005 Honda Accord Hybrid and the 2005 Acura RL (the company's luxury brand), the kindred systems use microphones in the front and rear of the vehicle to analyze noise from the engine and exhaust. By producing sound waves that oppose the frequency of the noise -- yet are virtually imperceptible to those riding in the car -- they are able to lower the overall decibel level. John Watts, manager of product planning at Acura, said that the systems, which come standard, can reduce interior noise by 10 decibels.
2004-12-10	Honda Will Replace Parts Blamed for Fires	Amid a federal investigation into the causes of engine fires in CR-V sport utility vehicles, Honda has agreed to replace the faulty oil filters that it believes are responsible for the fires. Starting today, Honda will begin notifying approximately 295,000 CR-V owners of the potential for the vehicle to catch fire after its first oil change. Honda will also offer to inspect the oil filters of recently serviced CR-V's and replace the filters free if necessary.
2004-12-08	Automakers Sue to Block Emissions Law In California	Toyota, General Motors and seven other automakers filed suit on Tuesday to block California's new greenhouse gas regulation, which was approved by the state in its final form in September. The suit sets up a battle between automakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. Although Mr. Schwarzenegger is a fan of the Hummer, an S.U.V. with prodigious greenhouse gas emissions, he has promised nonetheless to defend the regulation, which was signed by his Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis.
2004-12-01	FORMER MAZDA EXECUTIVE WILL SUCCEED MANAGER AT HONDA	The Honda Motor Company said Tom G. Elliott, the highest-ranking American manager at its sales unit in the United States, would retire in 2005 and would be succeeded by John W. Mendel, a former executive of the Mazda Motor Corporation. Mr. Elliott, an executive vice president, joined American Honda in 1970 and will retire next year, a company spokesman, Jeffrey Smith, said. Mr. Mendel will become senior vice president for the United States unit's automotive operations, Mr. Smith said. His appointment is effective today. Mr. Elliott is in charge of product planning, advertising, marketing and distribution at American Honda, which is based in Torrance, Calif. Mr. Mendel resigned in November from Mazda's North American unit, where he had been executive vice president of sales and marketing since December 2001.

2004-11-27	This Year, Ontario May Pass Michigan In Making Vehicles	Michigan has been the heart of the auto industry since Henry Ford started mass-producing the Model T a century ago, but the Midwestern state is poised to be surpassed by Ontario. The Canadian province is on course to pass Michigan this year and become the biggest auto-producing state or province in North America, according to Ward's Automotive, which tracks auto production data.
2004-11-20	Honda and Regulators Meet On Engine Fires in S.U.V.'s	Honda officials met with federal regulators on Friday to discuss an engine problem that has led to about 80 fires in Honda CRV sport utility vehicles. While Honda has previously blamed careless service mechanics, the company told regulators on Friday that faulty gaskets made by a Chinese supplier are a major factor. The gaskets were used by one of several suppliers of oil filters. Filters from that supplier were installed in some of the vehicles, starting in the 2003 model year.
2004-11-10	HONDA TO BUILD TRANSMISSION PLANT IN GEORGIA	The Honda Motor Company said yesterday that it would spend $270 million to build a transmission plant in Georgia and expand operations in Ohio and Alabama. The expansion will add 600 jobs in the United States, 400 of them at the new plant in Tallapoosa, Ga., 40 miles west of Atlanta. The Georgia plant will be Honda's 13th manufacturing operation in North America; it is scheduled to open in the fall of 2006. The other 200 jobs will be added at existing plants in Russells Point, Ohio, and Lincoln, Ala. Honda is based in Tokyo. Danny Hakim (NYT)
2004-10-28	Profit Falls At Honda; Sales Down In America	The Honda Motor Company reported a 7.5 percent drop in quarterly net profit Wednesday as the dollar fell and sales slowed in North America. Still, the profit decline was smaller than analysts had expected, as robust sales of cars in Asia and Europe and a big increase in global motorcycle sales supported Honda's bottom line. Also, the automaker raised its profit outlook for its fiscal year ending in March by 7 percent.
2004-10-27	At the Beijing Auto Show, Signs of a Behemoth to Come	THE Beijing auto show is starting to look a lot like auto shows in Detroit or Frankfurt or Geneva, a sign of how China has become one of the world's great industrial powers. The idiosyncratic, locally built clunkers found in other developing countries, like the Ambassador cars of India, are nearly gone. In their place are sleek models made in China by practically all of the world's multinational automakers -- sedans from Honda, minivans from General Motors and sport utility vehicles from Toyota -- and a range of locally designed cars.
2004-10-27	Dad to Virtual Rad? Call the Digimodders	IN a world where many cars look alike, a car that reflects its owner's personality and style is more and more at a premium. Detroit knows there is a deep divide between needs and dreams: the car you require and the car to which you aspire. That's why the marketing buzzword ''aspirational'' has become the smoothest pebble in the stream of sales talk coming from that city in the last few years.
2004-10-27	Green de Luxe	THE hybrid is about to enter the latte generation's comfort zone. By April, Toyota will start selling the Lexus RX400h, a sport utility vehicle that gets compact-car gas mileage.
2004-10-27	For Them, a Car Is a Blank Canvas	WHY would a person spend more money on jazzing up his car than the car is worth, let alone spend many times more? Maybe it would be an exaggeration to say that there are as many reasons for doing so as there are kinds of hubcaps. But customizing addicts come to their passions in different ways. For some, it becomes their business as well as their obsession. Here are some examples of the breed. The Sacrifice Is Worth It CHRISTINA OCHOA -- 29, custom car shop owner in Wichita Falls, Tex. HER RIDE -- 1997 Honda Civic, bought new in December 1996. AMOUNT SPENT ON IMPROVEMENTS -- $30,000. HOW SHE GOT THE BUG -- ''I was the type of girl that liked to take care of my car, keep it cleaned and waxed,'' said Mrs. Ochoa. So when she bought her Civic, her husband, Alex, suggested she put special wheels on it. Next, she wanted tinted windows and a better stereo system. ''And from there I couldn't stop,'' she said. Adding things to the Civic (and her husband's car and bike customizing hobby) led the couple to open a customizing business in Wichita Falls. MY BIRTHDAY PRESENTS ARE CAR STUFF -- She improved her car rather than go on a honeymoon. She's proud of every detail and talks about those fillips the same way a fashionista coos over her newest Jimmy Choos. ''I love when I hear from people, 'I've never noticed that before, how long has that been on?' '' Mrs. Ochoa said. POINTS OF PRIDE -- The Civic has won 40 trophies at shows in Texas and throughout the South. The trophies are on display at AK Performance, the shop she and her husband own. DRIVING HABITS -- Mrs. Ochoa drives the car about twice a week. She usually stops at a parking lot to show it off. ''We don't cruise -- that leaves a lot of room for accidents to happen,'' she said. CAR VALUES -- To Mrs. Ochoa, improving her Civic is a way to prove to herself that her goals are reachable. She is trying to impart these lessons to her daughter, who is 2 and attended her first car show at 3 months. The Civic is a metaphor for Mrs. Ochoa's life, she said; like her marriage, she is not ready to trade in the Honda. She'll stick with both. The Old Pro JERRY ROMAN -- 66, custom car shop owner in Ohio. HIS (NEWEST) RIDE -- 2000 Cadillac Escalade; he also has a 70's Corvette with $200,000 of chrome work, he says. And Mr. Roman has the first car he ever customized, a 1953 Olds, complete with the television and turntable he installed in the ceiling. HOW HE GOT THE BUG -- In the late 50's, Mr. Roman, an auto body repairman, paid his employers to use their garage to customize his 1953 Oldsmobile Holiday Coupe. In 1960, he bought out his employer and started customizing Corvettes. Mr. Roman never finished painting the Olds, and he never drove it to see if the TV worked, either. Today it is on display in his showroom, Roman Chariot, in Cleveland. Mr. Roman owns another shop in Akron. WHY HE STILL LOVES DOING THIS -- After operating a successful business for 40 years, Mr. Roman says he still admires the pluck of the ''young fellow'' who tinkers with his car in his own garage. ''The kids paint everything on the interior; it only holds up for so long but they give it a good look,'' he said. After all, Mr. Roman used to be that young fellow and he knows where that passion can lead. HOW THE BUSINESS HAS CHANGED -- Today, Mr. Roman says, auto manufacturers are elbowing into the aftermarket accessories business, offering car enhancements through dealers. Nevertheless, local car dealers are some of Mr. Roman's best customers, he says. CAR VALUES -- The Escalade is Mr. Roman's marketing tool and ''guinea pig,'' where he tests all his new ideas. He drives it every day. Three weeks ago, another Escalade owner saw Mr. Roman's model and ordered $15,000 worth of similar accessories. For Love of the Road, and the Stares IMAN ALAVI -- 23, owns a computer game accessories company in Tomball, Tex. HIS RIDE -- 2002 BMW M3, bought in 2004 for $35,000. AMOUNT SPENT ON IMPROVEMENTS -- $42,000 (more are planned). HOW HE GOT THE BUG -- He has always loved cars, Mr. Alavi said. And the BMW is the fourth car he has customized. At 16, with the help of two friends, he rebuilt the engine and installed a stereo in his first car, a 1997 Corvette. When he wasn't fixing up that car, he spent a lot of time hanging around Progressive AutoSports, a car shop in Houston, getting ideas for improving his next ride. But today, between traveling for his business, System-Mods.com, and running the daily operations, Mr. Alavi doesn't do the car work himself. Instead he relies on Taza Zohar of Progressive AutoSports in Houston. WHY SPEND ALL THAT MONEY? -- ''Money is great, but you can only look at it for so long,'' said Mr. Alavi, who says fixing up the car is pure enjoyment. Mr. Alavi markets hardware that allows computer gamers to redesign their Xbox dashboards. Those same gamers show up at car shows, where Mr. Alavi plans to show off the car, especially the inside doors, which glow in neon blue with his company's logo when opened. DRIVING HABITS -- Fast. A new turbocharged engine is planned for the car, satisfying Mr. Alavi's desire for driving fast. As a street-racing teenager, he said that he accumulated 10 speeding tickets a year. ''I've been ticket-free for two and a half years,'' he said. ''I learned to slow down.''
2004-10-24	Wheel Is Turning Against S.U.V.'s	ABOUT once a month, without fail, as Bryan Feery drives his Hummer around Glastonbury, somebody holds up a hand as he passes by. The person isn't waving. ''Oh absolutely, I get the finger from people,'' he said.
2004-10-12	Why Are Honda CR-V's Catching Fire?	With barely 10,000 miles on the odometer of his 2003 Honda CR-V sport utility vehicle, the only thing Steve Elder expected to smell inside was that new- car scent. But as he drove home after having the oil changed last December, his CR-V began to fill with smoke.
2004-10-07	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Top-Selling Car	Honda Motor had Japan's best-selling model in September as its Fit compact car beat the Toyota Corolla for a second straight month. Sales of the Fit rose 7.4 percent, to 15,482 units, in September from the month a year ago, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. Toyota, Japan's biggest automaker, sold 14,788 Corollas, down 16 percent.
2004-09-12	Such a Polite Young Van	TESTED: 2005 Honda Odyssey Touring WHAT IS IT? Next generation of Honda's popular, groundbreaking minivan. HOW MUCH? Estimated prices from $25,000 (LX) to $38,000 (Touring with navigation system and DVD player). WHEN? On sale Sept. 22. WHAT MAKES IT RUN? Single-cam V-6 (3.5 liters, 255 horsepower); 5-speed automatic transmission; front-wheel drive. E.P.A. CITY/HIGHWAY MILEAGE: 20/28 ALTERNATIVES: Toyota Sienna XLE Limited, Chrysler Town & Country Limited, Nissan Quest 3.5 SE; Mercury Monterey Premier; Buick Terraza. ''WELCOME,'' Honda's redesigned minivan says when the driver gets in, via a readout in the instrument cluster. The good cheer continues until the trip ends, when the Odyssey really does say ''Goodbye.'' In lots of families, this would be the most polite member of the household.
2004-09-05	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Mazdaspeed Miata and Honda S2000; In Hot Pursuit of an Endless Summer	IT is a familiar problem in the car business: a once-revolutionary model has been around so long that it no longer generates much excitement in the showroom. But the bean counters in the executive suite remain determined to wring still more revenue from the aging design. How can a company light the fire again?
2004-08-27	Sure, It's Pragmatic. But Stylish? The Minivan Is Getting a Makeover	Julie Blewitt once vowed she would never own a minivan. ''I grew up humiliated being chauffeured about in a wood-paneled station wagon,'' said Ms. Blewitt, 34, of Loveland, Colo. ''I swore I would never drive the modern-day equivalent.'' But a couple of children can dent such resolve. Earlier this summer, she and her husband competed at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan in the Minivan Summer Games, part of a promotion by DaimlerChrysler, in the auto industry's latest attempt to cast off the minivan's dowdy image.
2004-08-05	Auto Industry Debates Virtues of Diesels vs. Hybrids	Automakers remain divided on whether diesel or hybrid cars are the best way to improve fuel efficiency, and the split is often drawn along cultural lines. All the major manufacturers are developing cleaner diesel engines, hybrids and hydrogen fuel cells. But companies are pushing harder on different technologies to get a leg up in meeting regulations that are becoming tougher around the world, and their views were represented in comments made at a management conference here on Wednesday.
2004-07-28	Mitsubishi Looks for Buyers and Its Niche	With American sales of Mitsubishi, once one of the hottest car brands, in a free fall, the company's executives are trying to engineer a turnaround. It could not come too soon for dealers and employees. ''June was a terrible month. I sold 10 cars,'' said Maria Prendergast-Lunn, general manager of Auddie Brown Mitsubishi in Florence, S.C., 80 miles from the major metropolitan center of Columbia. A year ago the dealership sold 75 Mitsubishis a month.
2004-07-28	Study Says Blacks Paid More for Honda Loans	A new study has found that black customers are almost twice as likely as whites to be charged a marked-up rate when they finance a purchase through the loan subsidiary of Honda Motor, and that on average, blacks are charged higher markups than whites. The study, covering nearly 400,000 people who borrowed from the American Honda Finance Corporation from June 1999 to March 2003, was conducted by Mark Cohen, a professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits against several automakers. His research has been at the center of those cases.
2004-07-02	Ford and G.M. Sales Both Fell More Than 11% in June	General Motors and Ford Motor said Thursday that their United States sales for June had double-digit declines, as Detroit continued to lose ground to Japanese and Korean rivals. Over all, sales in the United States were weaker than expected, down 5.97 percent from a year ago, when adjusted for an extra sales day this year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The seasonally adjusted selling rate for cars and light trucks tumbled to 15.4 million in June from 17.8 million in May, Ward's said.
2004-06-30	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Tax Bill For Honda	The tax authorities have ordered Honda Motor to pay 13 billion yen ($120 million) in additional taxes on profit from its motorcycle business in Brazil. Tax authorities say Honda did not allocate enough of the profit from its Brazilian subsidiary, Moto Honda da Amazonia, to its headquarters business in Japan for the six years to 2002. Honda said it would pay the tax but would appeal the ruling. Honda's Brazilian unit made about 820,000 motorcycles last year and 90 percent of them were sold in Brazil. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-06-19	Hybrid Vehicles Hit the Heartland...Barely	Julie Buhl drives a Toyota Prius in pickup country. She is one of a very few people in this tree-lined western Michigan city of 77,000 who drives a hybrid car, which uses electric power to save gasoline. People here, like everywhere else, are complaining about gas prices this summer, but traffic does not often grind to a halt in Kalamazoo, and on a recent afternoon it took only a matter of minutes to cruise from a complex of Pfizer offices downtown to the city's outskirts.
2004-05-21	Off to a Showroom, Diploma in Hand	WITH high-school graduation time -- and, for the lucky, the concomitant high-school graduation car -- approaching, a growing number of teenagers and their parents have been hitting Web sites, scanning the papers and visiting dealers' lots. They are weighing factors like price, safety and gas mileage against the harder-to-define hipness factor to come up with a car they can agree on. And what do American teenagers want in their driveways?
2004-04-29	Hyundai Near Top of a Quality Ranking	For the first time, new-car buyers ranked Hyundai, the South Korean automaker, higher in initial quality than any domestic or European manufacturer, according to a survey released on Wednesday by J.D. Power & Associates The result was a coup for Hyundai, which has been trying hard to upgrade its image from cheap to classy, or at least respectable, and close the gap between it and Toyota Motor and Honda Motor.
2004-04-28	Strong Yen and Drop in U.S. Sales Hurt Profit at Honda	The Honda Motor Company said Tuesday that profit fell more than a third in the latest quarter, hurt by unfavorable currency swings and a decline in sales in the crucial North American market. Honda, which was surpassed by Nissan Motor as Japan's second-largest carmaker, also warned that it expected net profit to fall 16 percent for the year ending in March 2005 because of foreign exchange losses.
2004-04-23	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda In Russia	Saying it expects strong growth in Russian auto sales, the Honda Motor Company said that it had established a subsidiary in Russia to sell its cars, motorcycles and other products. The move is the latest by Honda to increase sales in markets outside of North America and Japan. A cut in Russia's consumption tax and the country's expected entry into the World Trade Organization in a few years will help sales of cars, Honda said. Todd Zaun (NYT)
2004-04-19	Struck in Side, Many Cars Fare Poorly In Safety Test	The results are in from the first consumer test of how passenger cars fare when struck in the side by sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. And they are not good. Ten of 13 midsize car models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group financed by car insurers, received the lowest of four possible ratings, indicating a likelihood of serious or fatal injury. The tests also showed that women were at disproportionate risk in truck-car side-impact collisions.
2004-04-09	My Life, My Honda Odyssey	WHO -- Will Halm, 51, lawyer, Los Angeles WHAT -- 2002 Honda Odyssey I've always wanted kids, but I never pictured myself with a minivan. Los Angeles is extremely car-conscious, and let's face it, minivans aren't that fabulous. But as every parent knows, convenience trumps status. I chauffeur my kids to school, piano lessons, soccer, gymnastics and ballet. I'm a very typical parent in that respect, even if my family is less traditional than most. When it comes to a family car, we have the same needs as everyone else.
2004-03-26	CHRYSLER TO STOP OFFERING LEASES IN NEW YORK STATE	The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler will stop offering vehicle leases in New York State May 1 because of a law that holds leasing companies liable in accidents. The action by Chrysler comes a day after the Honda Motor Company said it resumed leasing in New York and raised prices to compensate for the state law. General Motors and Ford halted leasing in New York last year.
2004-03-21	Behind the wheel/2004 Acura TL; Those German Lessons Are Paying Off	WHEN I first encountered the redesigned 2004 Acura TL, it was like being reintroduced to an old friend. No, not to the 2000-model Acura 3.2 TL that resides in my garage -- a car that suddenly looked and felt dowdy by comparison -- but to a red-blooded German sport sedan like the Audi A4. This third generation of the midsize Acura, introduced last fall, resembles a modern German automobile more than it looks like my own beloved but aging TL, or like the original TL of 1995.
2004-03-02	Heading West, And Then East, Once a Week	Since November 2000, I've shuttled from Atlanta to Los Angeles and back once a week, 50 weeks a year, to work on a software project at Honda's American headquarters in Torrance, Calif. Last year, I added 173,000 miles on my Delta platinum card, departing every Sunday night at 5:55 on Flight 177, which gets me into my suite in the Torrance Hilton in time for a good night's sleep, and returning on the red-eye -- Flight 196 -- on Thursday, which gives me a long weekend at home with my family.
2004-01-31	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda's Profit Rises	Honda Motor said it earned 151 billion yen ($1.4 billion) in its third quarter, a 31 percent increase over the year-earlier quarter. Sales in the period, which ended Dec. 31, were steady at 2 trillion yen. Honda raised its outlook for full-year income by 0.6 percent, to 473 billion yen. Ken Belson (NYT)
2004-01-18	Growth Trend: Big Pickups	TOYOTA does not have a flashing sign at the Detroit auto show telling the hometown companies to watch out. Instead, it has a bold, brash, oversize blue pickup called the FTX, a design study that sends a clear message to the competition: Toyota's next big truck will be, yes, big. Company executives conceded that the FTX, with a pugnacious grille wearing a thick crown of chrome, hints at the size and look of their next-generation Tundra, to begin production in 2006. Until this year, when Toyota introduced its larger-all-around Tundra Double Cab, its largest pickup fell short of rivals from Detroit's Big Three.
2004-01-06	Detroit to Focus on Tastes as Its Market Share Decreases	The strengthening economy and generous sales incentives led to robust car sales last year, automakers said Monday, but the American companies' share of the market continued to shrink as import brands like Toyota, Honda and BMW posted the biggest gains. Despite those declines, the American companies did not pledge to increase market share in 2004, as they have often done. Instead, they said they would look for ways to make the cars and trucks that they do sell more profitable, largely by making them more appealing to consumers.
2004-01-06	Automakers Unveil Plans for More Hybrid Models	The number of fuel-efficient hybrid models available in the United States will more than double in the next year, to seven from three, with new entries coming from Toyota, Honda and Ford Motor. Two of the new vehicles were announced at the North American International Auto Show -- one of the auto industry's most important annual product previews -- which opened here Sunday for the news media.
2003-12-18	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda Sales Outlook	Honda Motor said it expected the introduction of new models to increase auto sales globally by 10 percent next year. Honda, the No.2 carmaker in Japan, said it expected to sell 3.2 million vehicles next year. In the United States, Honda's most profitable market, the company expects sales to hit 1.4 million, a 4 percent increase, while sales in Japan are expected to rise 8.1 percent. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-12-03	Revived Economy Helped Lift Automakers' November Sales	Sales at General Motors, BMW and Honda's luxury division, Acura, all surged last month, largely because of the rebounding economy, automakers said Tuesday. DaimlerChrysler said its sales rose slightly in November from the month a year ago, while the Ford Motor Company's sales showed a decline. G.M. said its sales grew 22 percent in November, with truck sales up 30 percent and the Cadillac division up 43 percent. Honda reported record sales for Acura, a gain of 24.7 percent over last year. BMW said it had its best November sales ever; sales increased 6.4 percent over all, led by an 18 percent increase for the Mini.
2003-10-30	Honda Says Its Cars Will Be Among Safest	Honda announced on Wednesday an ambitious plan to make its vehicles among the safest on the road. The company's executives said that several advanced safety technologies that are currently offered as options would become standard equipment on Honda vehicles as well as those made by its Acura division.
2003-10-22	Mitsubishi Falters as Other Makers Thrive	While Toyota, Honda and Nissan prosper, Mitsubishi continues to stumble. Mitsubishi's credit rating was cut two notches on Tuesday, to further below investment grade by Standard & Poor's, which cited the company's weak sales in the United States and losses on its consumer loans.
2003-10-22	Unlikely Converts to the Tuner Look, Far From San Diego	WHEN Patrick Dean first began posting photos of his black Saturn SC2 on the Internet four years ago, he knew that it would be no easy task to attract the notice of the import tuner crowd. At the time, typical tuners were young men who lived in Southern California and spent practically every waking minute (not to mention every last cent) customizing their Hondas and Mitsubishis with asphaltgrazing rocker panels, carbon-fiber hoods and bottles of nitrous oxide to fuel the huge boost of speed needed in street drag racing.
2003-10-02	Buyers Cash In on Offers to Keep Car Sales Strong	September auto sales slowed from August but continued to show strength, surprising analysts. Customers took advantage of the latest price war. Last month, General Motors was giving away Dell computers to Saturn buyers, in addition to the usual offer of zero-percent financing and big rebates that were heaviest on remaining 2003 models.
2003-09-10	Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: XM Equipment To Become Standard In Accords	XM Satellite Radio Holdings, which operates the nation's biggest satellite-radio service, said yesterday that its equipment would become standard on certain models of Honda Motor's Accord. XM might also be installed at the dealership on all 2004 Honda S2000 roadsters and Honda Pilots, Andy Boyd, a spokesman for Honda, said. XM is hoping to gain subscribers by making the equipment needed to receive its 101-channel satellite radio network standard in popular vehicles. Earlier this year, XM announced that its equipment would be standard on the 2004 Acura RL and TL sedans made by Honda. Honda owns about 8 percent of XM, Mr. Boyd said. General Motors has installed XM equipment in more than 500,000 vehicles since it was first put in Cadillacs in the 2002 model year, said Chance Patterson, an XM spokesman. G.M. owns a 15 percent stake in XM, he said. Shares of XM Satellite Radio rose $1.52, or 10 percent, to $16.10.
2003-08-24	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Toyota Prius; From Hybrid Seed, a Greener Harvest	HALFWAY through a 250-mile drive in the 2004 Prius, I pulled into a gas station here -- not because the hybrid gasoline-electric car was low on fuel, but because I was eager to top off the tank and make some mileage calculations. The new Prius quickly caught the eye of Dennis Reed, who was filling the tank of his wife's Mercedes-Benz ML430 sport utility. As he looked over my test car, Mr. Reed said that although he had little interest in the previous, smaller Prius, he liked the larger size and sophisticated look of the second-generation hybrid sedan. ''I could spring for this one,'' he said.
2003-08-17	Business; Yes, Assembly Lines Can Mix Apples and Oranges	SHOPPERS for new cars are often frustrated when they can't get the newest model exactly when they want it. Their fickle tastes will be much easier to satisfy, however, as plants like the Honda Motor Company's sprawling factory here become the norm in the industry. In this factory 35 miles northwest of Columbus, the small Honda Civic and the big, boxy Element are being made not only in the same plant, but also on the same assembly line, a radical departure for the auto industry in the United States. Historically, the industry has had a method of one plant, one car.
2003-08-08	Chevrolet Aims to Take Lead From Ford With Nine New Models	The Chevrolet division of General Motors plans to introduce nine new models over 20 months, starting in January, setting up a battle to overtake the Ford brand as the nation's top seller. ''This product barrage should help get Chevy back to selling three million cars and trucks a year,'' said Gary L. Cowger, president of G.M.'s North American operations.
2003-07-30	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda Profit Slips	The Honda Motor Company said that profits slipped 5.4 percent in the April-to-June period because of slowing sales at home and a strengthening yen. The company, Japan's second-largest automaker, earned 102 billion yen ($850 million) in the first quarter of its fiscal year. Sales grew 3.7 percent because of strong demand overseas. Sales in Japan, however, fell 28 percent. Honda raised its full-year profit target by 2.5 percent, to 451 billion yen ($3.7 billion), on the expectation that the yen will weaken before the end of the fiscal year in March 2004. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-07-10	Cruise Control May Be Goal of Honda's Chief	A couple of years ago, the Honda Motor Company invited a few professional race-car drivers to its famed three-ringed test track in Motegi, two hours north of Tokyo, to show off its latest creations and get feedback from people who make their living through speed. To add to the fun that day, Honda rolled out its Side-by-Side, a Formula-One-style car with a 750-cc motorcycle engine in a slim racing body. The professionals raced the cars around the one-kilometer track in about 31 seconds.
2003-07-02	4% Rise in Auto Sales in June Fuels Optimism at the Big Three	Nationwide auto sales rose in June, but the domestic industry continued to lose ground to foreign competitors like Toyota despite spending heavily on consumer purchase incentives. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company were upbeat in conference calls today, though, saying that they saw positive signs for industry sales in the second half of the year.
2003-06-20	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda Sets Day Off	One of Japan's largest carmakers, the Honda Motor Company, said it would halt production for one day at its factories and research centers in the Tokyo area to pre-empt a potential power shortage. Honda will shut 16 factories and research outlets on July 24 and make up the production later. Honda said it would save enough electricity to supply 30,000 households. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, Tokyo's main electricity provider, has warned of possible power shortages this summer. The government forced Tokyo Electric to shut its nuclear reactors after the utility admitted to falsifying nuclear safety reports. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-06-19	U.S. Automakers Improve Efficiency, But Some Troubling Figures Remain	With every piece of good news about the Big Three comes another reminder of how wide the competitive gap with Japan remains. Today, a report on manufacturing efficiency in North American auto plants last year showed encouraging results for American automakers. General Motors continued to make impressive strides toward closing the productivity gap with Japanese automakers. And the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler, the least productive of the six largest automakers in North America, had the industry's best year-over-year improvement in 2002.
2003-05-20	HONDA UNIT WILL STOP LEASING VEHICLES IN 3 STATES	The Honda Motor Company's finance unit said yesterday that it would stop leasing vehicles to residents of New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island in July because of laws that leave leasing companies accountable in traffic accidents. Honda's action follows similar moves by the finance units of General Motors and Ford in response to the so-called vicarious liability laws. Such laws allow a leasing company to be held responsible for accidents caused by customers operating leased vehicles. Honda's unit, the American Honda Finance Corporation, based in Torrance, Calif., is offering customers alternatives to leasing a vehicle, including a $1,500 damage waiver on excess wear and use. The New York Legislature is considering changes to the state's leasing law.
2003-05-11	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Acura TSX; A Sedan So Complete Only Its Soul Is Missing	THE Acura TSX is the Stepford wife of sport sedans. Like one of the complaisant clones in Ira Levin's sci-fi feminist novel (and the deliciously dated movie of 1975), the new TSX does everything one could ask of it and offers still more. Agile and athletic, fuel-efficient, luxuriously refined and loaded with standard features like a 360-watt sound system, leather upholstery, power moonroof and a stability-control system, the TSX undercuts a similarly equipped BMW 325i -- a main rival for your affections -- by $6,000.
2003-05-02	Tiny Tables For Travel	America is, as the title of a recent book suggests, a ''Fast Food Nation.'' In some regions, the drive-through is so important that burger chains have eliminated sit-down areas altogether. But after the cashier has passed that grilled stuffed chili cheese chicken quesadilla into the car, where do you put it? Carmakers who won their stripes in the cup-holder wars have rushed to the rescue. A few of the latest S.U.V.'s come with tiny tables designed for Big Macs, Biggie Fries and Big Kings. Think of them as TV trays for travelers.
2003-05-02	Auto Sales Dropped 6.1% During April	Auto sales for April improved on a sluggish first quarter, receiving a modest bump from a renewed incentive push by the Big Three, but were still below the strong levels of a year ago. ''When one considers the heavy incentives for the month, the sales levels are quite disappointing,'' said Domenic D. Martilotti, an analyst for Bear, Stearns. ''Each iteration of this zero-percent-for-60-months push, there are clearly diminishing returns. So the question is, where do we go from here?''
2003-04-26	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda Profit Rises	The Honda Motor Company said profit rose 9.4 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31 as a result of cost-cutting and the success of its minivans and sport utility vehicles. Honda, Japan's second-largest carmaker, earned 117 billion yen ($975 million) in the quarter as sales grew 7.4 percent. For the full fiscal year, Honda's profits grew 17.6 percent. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-04-23	2 New Chiefs in Japan Honed Skills in U.S.	In a sign of Japan's increasing reliance on the American consumer, two of the country's largest and most profitable companies -- Honda Motor and Takeda Chemical Industries -- named leaders today who have long track records of experience in the United States. With high labor costs, falling prices and economic stagnation in Japan for most of the last decade, leading manufacturers here have found it increasingly difficult to prosper in their home market and have turned more of their attention overseas, especially to the United States.
2003-04-19	Cloaked in Green, But Pushing Trucks	As the Ford Motor Company scaled back expectations this week for its first hybrid-powered vehicle and backpedaled on a pledge to improve the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles, Toyota was introducing its latest Prius, which will get about 55 miles a gallon and be the first midsize vehicle with hybrid technology. For environmentalists, the contrasting developments reinforced the sense that only foreign carmakers care about curbing America's swelling appetite for oil. ''The Japanese are where you go if you want good technology, and Detroit is where you go if you don't,'' said Daniel Becker, the top global warming expert at the Sierra Club.
2003-04-16	With Taurus in Its Last Days, Ford Bets on 3 Cars to Take On Japan	The Ford Motor Company is starting to write the obituary of the Taurus, the last American sedan that credibly competed with Japan. Company executives said yesterday that the Taurus would be phased out in the middle of the decade and that three new vehicles Ford was developing would replace it.
2003-04-10	Suit Accuses Toyota Of Bias in Lending	A lawsuit was filed in San Francisco yesterday accusing the financing unit of Toyota Motor of discriminating against black and Hispanic car buyers in setting the interest rates on their dealer-arranged loans. The suit was filed in California Superior Court by a team of lawyers that includes Bill Lann Lee, who ran the Justice Department's civil rights division during the Clinton administration. He is now a partner at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein in San Francisco.
2003-04-02	Detroit on a Mission: No Slip in Auto Sales	Auto sales continued their sluggish pace last month, according to figures released today, prompting the Big Three automakers to broaden their no-interest loan offers. Sales actually fell less than many analysts had expected in March, just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, and cars were still selling at a fairly healthy rate. But automakers are clearly worried enough to offer a new round of deals that General Motors called unprecedented, setting up a test for the industry in April.
2003-03-12	World Business Briefing | Asia: India: Honda Renews License	The Honda Motor Company said it would renew for another 10 years the pact to transfer technology to its Indian joint venture, Hero Honda Motors Ltd., after the current agreement expires in 2004. A spokesman for Honda's Southwest Asia operation said Honda hoped to control 50 percent of India's market for two-wheeled transportation by 2005. Honda, which is based in Japan, owns 26 percent of Hero Honda and has a fully owned subsidiary in India. Combined, the two Honda units control slightly more than a third of the market for motorcycles, mopeds and motorbikes. Saritha Rai (NYT)
2003-03-06	California Offers Change In Car Rules	California is seeking to compromise with automakers by dropping a requirement that they sell electric cars, the state's latest attempt to persuade carmakers to end their opposition to the program. The California Air Resources Board outlined proposed changes to the zero-emission vehicle program today that would let companies sell more gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell autos instead of battery-powered cars starting with 2005 models, a spokesman, Dimitri Stanich, said.
2003-02-28	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Exports Gain	Exports of Japanese vehicles increased 16.8 percent in January from a year earlier as carmakers supplemented onshore production in North America and Europe. Auto exports, which hit a nine-year high in 2002, have risen for 13 consecutive months. Shipments by Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Mitsubishi all rose more than 25 percent in January. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-02-18	A List Some Carmakers Don't Covet	Automakers are obsessed with ratings, from customer satisfaction to how many hours it takes workers to assemble a car. But there is at least one list many do not like to talk about. The Environmental Protection Agency rates every vehicle according to the amount of pollutants coming out of the tailpipe that contribute to smog, which can worsen asthma and lead to cancer and lung damage. Many popular sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rank at the bottom on the 0-to-10 scale. Among them are a number of recently introduced -- and highly profitable -- models.
2003-02-02	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Honda Accord; Further Dividends From Honda's Midsize Investments	IN the 1980's, before Americans discovered the joys of commuting in vehicles designed for safaris, the family sedan was king of the road. Chevy and Ford vied with pretenders from Japan. Near the end of each model year, automakers mounted last-ditch efforts to win the crown that went to the nation's best-selling car. Detroit no longer has its heart, or its wallet, in this race: its automaking profits come mostly from trucks and truck-based S.U.V.'s. But the Japanese (as well as the Germans and Koreans) still invest heavily in midsize, midprice cars, and the market is crowded with classy models at fair prices. The latest, and one of the greatest, is the seventh-generation Honda Accord.
2003-02-01	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: A Profit At Honda	The Honda Motor Company earned 115 billion yen ($958 million) in the October-December period, a 40 percent surge from the period a year earlier, thanks to strong sales in the United States and Europe. Honda, the No. 2 carmaker in Japan, also produced the best-selling car in Japan. Its Fit compact car unseated the Toyota Corolla, which had ranked No. 1 for three decades. Honda's motorcycle sales rose 40 percent in the period. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-01-28	Hybrid Autos Quick to Pass Curiosity Stage	Hybrids, vehicles that save gasoline by combining electric motors with internal combustion engines, are emerging as the first alternative-powered cars to show signs of catching on with automakers and some consumers since the automobile's early days. Toyota and Honda are already selling tens of thousands of hybrids, and General Motors and Ford, worried about ceding another fast-moving market to the Japanese, have announced plans to join them. The hybrid's rise has been encouraged by pressure from environmentalists and regulators, particularly California rules curbing greenhouse gases and smog-forming pollutants.
2003-01-24	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda Debt In Review	Moody's Investors Service has put the debt rating for the Honda Motor Company on review for a possible upgrade. Honda, Japan's second-largest carmaker, has improved its market position and financial flexibility, Moody's said. Honda is one of the few Japanese carmakers with rising sales in Japan, and last year its minicar, the Fit, was the top seller. The company's sales in the United States and Europe have also increased. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-01-19	G.M. Primps for Its Return to the Midsize Ball	EAGER to rekindle some of the passenger-car magic it lost long ago, General Motors is conjuring up new automobiles to assault the midsize market it once dominated. The Chevrolet Malibu, a sideshow in recent years, is moving to G.M.'s center ring. Executives fervently hope that an all-new 2004 model will resonate with buyers the way its namesake did in the 1960's and 70's.
2003-01-16	Carmakers Design For Generation Y	The Honda Element looks like a sport utility vehicle that married a Brink's truck, with as much headroom as a Greyhound bus. Inside, Honda calls it a dormitory room on wheels, with seats that can be turned around, pulled out, folded flat, stacked with gear and hosed off. The Toyota Scion xB seems like a time-warped homage to Chrysler's 1980's minivans, shrunken and brought down to curb level. There are no gauges in front of the steering wheel to distract the driver; they are off to the center, above an ear-blasting Pioneer stereo prewired for satellite radio.
2003-01-10	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda's Compact Tops The Corolla	The Fit, a compact car made by the Honda Motor Company, has unseated the Toyota Motor Corporation's Corolla as Japan's most popular car, ending the Corolla's 34-year run at the top of the market. Honda sold 250,790 Fits last year, 24,000 more than the Corolla. Seven of the 10 best-selling cars in Japan were compact models. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-01-07	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Sales Fall	Auto sales in Japan fell to a 16-year low as consumers and companies continue to scale back spending. The country's 11 car and truck makers sold 5.8 million vehicles in 2002, a 2.3 percent decline from the previous year and the fewest since 1986. Sales by the market leader Toyota Motor Corporation fell 2.2 percent, while the Honda Motor Company, the second-largest company, rose 7.9 percent. Ken Belson (NYT)
2003-01-07	Rugged Rubber Bumpers à la Honda	They work as furiously as any Indy pit crew. In white jumpsuits and green baseball caps, the 10-man cleanup team arrives seconds after a tiny lime green Fit and a midsize four-door Legend smash into each other at about 30 miles an hour. Hubcaps are retrieved, broken glass swept up and computers plugged into the cars' data boxes. This is Honda's crash test center, one of the world's most advanced. The lab the size of a dozen football fields is at the forefront of Honda's efforts to reinvent itself as a safety leader -- the Volvo of Japan.
2002-12-19	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Strong Forecast At Honda	The Honda Motor Company expects global auto sales to rise 10 percent next year, helped by growing demand in the United States and other foreign markets. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, plans to sell 3.1 million cars worldwide in 2003. Sales are expected to rise 12.5 percent overseas and 4.4 percent in Japan. Honda sells more than twice as many cars overseas as it does in Japan. Honda also plans to double its capacity in China to 240,000 cars. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-12-15	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda Element; Young Man, Would You Like That In a Box?	A RECENT television commercial for the Honda Civic shows three young men sitting in the car. When a fourth arrives and asks, ''So, where do you guys wanna go?'' the others react with wilting disdain: the car itself is the destination, stupid. The ad's title is ''Hangout.'' Indeed, young people have made the Civic one of their favorite hangouts. But the 2003 Honda Element, which goes on sale Thursday, was designed from the start as a sort of clubhouse for ''active young men.'' The Element is based on the Model X design study that Honda showed in Detroit in 2001, with a boxy shape, center-opening doors and aspirations of being a postmodern love nest or a mobile dorm room that can be hosed out after wild parties.
2002-12-04	Big Three's Auto Sales Fell Sharply in November	Sales at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company fell sharply in November from robust levels a year ago, and stocks of both companies were battered today. Many investors are concerned about the prospect of slumping industry sales next year, which even the automakers are expecting, coupled with increasing competition as foreign carmakers open more plants in the United States and continue to encroach on the lucrative pickup and sport utility market.
2002-12-03	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Car Sales Rise	New automobile registrations, a crucial indicator of consumer spending, rose 6.6 percent in November from a year ago, the third consecutive monthly gain. Japan's largest automaker, the Toyota Motor Corporation, said sales rose 11 percent after it introduced new models. Sales at the Nissan Motor Company and the Honda Motor Company rose more than 7 percent each. Sales at the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, which is 37 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler, fell 16 percent. Over all, Japan's new-car market has not returned to the levels it had achieved before the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-10-29	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Honda's Profit Rises	Profit at the Honda Motor Company rose just 3.3 percent in the July-September quarter as a stronger yen chewed into potential gains. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, also said operating profit, a better gauge of the company's core business, fell 6.6 percent. Honda's sales, however, grew 9.5 percent, helped by strong demand in North America for its sport utility vehicles and minivans. Honda lowered its earning targets for the full year ending in March 2003, but still expects to post a record profit. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-10-23	Mercedes's Man in Detroit Wants to Give Chrysler Some Import Magic	DURING his first month as Chrysler's chief executive, with the auto company drowning in debt, Dieter Zetsche, newly arrived here from Germany, went to a Costco in search of batteries. Bewildered by the vast choices, he eventually found what he wanted, only to be stymied at the cash register when a clerk asked him for his membership card. A hand reached out behind him and a voice said, ''Here, Dr. Zetsche, you can use my card.'' It turned out to be a Chrysler employee who had recognized him from the company's internal television network.
2002-10-15	Miscellany	American Honda Motor Company, Torrance, Calif., part of Honda Motor, is presenting what the company describes as the first commercial to be filmed in the 70-millimeter, large-screen format used by the Imax Corporation. The spot was created by the Honda agency, Rubin Postaer & Associates, Santa Monica, Calif., and will appear before showings of ''Pulse: A Stomp Odyssey,'' an Imax movie sponsored by Honda.
2002-09-29	Toward A More Perfect Accord	Not long ago, officials of the American Honda Motor Company summoned a handful of automotive journalists, under conditions of relative secrecy, to a remote and sparsely populated town along Ohio's Muskingum River for an advance drive in the new 2003 Honda Accord. Holed up between test drives in a country inn, the captive audience braved the blizzard of technical facts and demographic insight that blankets all car debuts. Then came some brandspeak and a Power Point presentation that painstakingly reviewed the Accord's sales history, particularly relative to the Toyota Camry. The big news was that last year the Accord snatched the title of America's top-selling passenger car back from Toyota. Honda sold 414,718 Accords to Camry's 390,449. What's more, the Honda marketing bosses hastened to point out, if you subtracted discounted-to-the-point-of-profitless fleet sales to car rental agencies, you would find that Accord had actually beaten Camry throughout most of the 1990's. As for private citizens spending their own money, the Honda team concluded triumphantly, the Accord was No. 1, 9 years out of the last 10.
2002-09-22	Automakers Look Beyond Electric	HENRY FORD was a young mechanic at the Detroit Edison Company in 1896 when he had a chance to meet his hero Thomas Edison. ''This young fellow has made some sort of car he runs with gasoline,'' Ford's boss told Edison, according to an account from the 1987 book ''The Fords: An American Epic.'' Ford described to Edison the car and its internal-combustion engine.
2002-07-30	Sales Abroad Push Profit 20% Higher At Honda	The Honda Motor Company said today that earnings rose 20 percent in the April-June quarter, thanks to strong demand overseas for its minivans and sport utility vehicles. But weaker sales at home, a stronger yen and a potential slowdown in United States clouded the company's outlook. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker after Toyota Motor, remained confident, however, about its prospects the rest of the year. It left its full-year forecasts unchanged and planned to expand production at its plants in the United States and Asia.
2002-07-12	Industry Baffled by Honda's Plans in China	Most auto executives say that they know what makes a good site for an auto assembly plant: plenty of land and labor, superb road and rail links and lots of high-volume auto parts suppliers nearby. So heads are being scratched around the global industry over Honda's announcement on Wednesday that it hopes to build an assembly plant in Guangzhou, 85 miles up the Pearl River from here. While Guangzhou, once known as Canton, has plenty of land and a population approaching that of Los Angeles, its transportation links are mediocre and parts makers are scarce there.
2002-07-11	Japan Carves Out Major Role in China's Auto Future	In what may be the first big step toward China's emergence as a major source of automobiles, Honda Motor of Japan announced today that it would build the first car plant there dedicated to exports. The new plant will be able to turn out as many as 50,000 vehicles a year, starting in 2004, the company said. Hiroyuki Yoshino, Honda's president, told reporters that the quality of cars built at the plant would match those made in Japan, but that production costs in China would be 20 percent lower.
2002-06-29	Honda Considers Airlift of Steel	The Honda Motor Company is prepared to airlift 2,000 tons of carbon sheet steel to its auto factories in the United States and Canada next month if it cannot secure adequate supplies from steel producers in the United States, the company said today. The company's plans were prompted by steel-import tariffs of as much as 30 percent that President Bush imposed in March. As a result of the tariffs, steel makers are renegotiating contracts, and Honda may face a shortfall.
2002-06-26	Auto Union and Honda Dispute Safety Record at Plants in Ohio	Honda's four factories in central Ohio, including its sprawling assembly plant here that makes the highly popular Accord, turn out quality cars and motorcycles that are among the most profitable in the industry. But the United Automobile Workers says that the stellar efficiency comes at a price -- injury rates more than double the average for the American auto industry. The union, which has never successfully organized an assembly plant solely owned by a foreign auto manufacturer in the United States, compiled the injury data from federal records and hopes to use the information as the cornerstone of its campaign to represent Honda's workers. It plans a public forum on June 26 in Springfield, not far from this city about 30 miles northwest of Columbus, and made the data available in advance to The New York Times.
2002-06-15	Making Cleaner Cars	To the Editor: ''Honda Takes Up Case in U.S. for Green Energy'' (Business Day, June 12) should shame American automakers. Honda has proved that producing efficient and clean cars can be profitable.
2002-06-15	Making Cleaner Cars	To the Editor: The United States has a desperate need to reduce toxic auto emissions, greenhouse gas buildup and dependence on foreign oil. So where do we find a patriotic response to this American problem? Not from domestic auto companies that fight tooth and nail against higher gasoline mileage standards and not from the Bush administration, which bows to the auto companies, but from that good old American patriot, Honda (Business Day, June 12).
2002-06-14	G.M. Beat Ford in Efficiency, A Study of Auto Plants Finds	Last year, for the first time since a closely watched study began tracking productivity, General Motors was more efficient than the Ford Motor Company in building cars. But both companies, along with DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, continue to trail Asian competitors in productivity and profitability. The gap remains wide, even though the three major Asian automakers -- Toyota, Honda Motor and Nissan -- slipped a bit last year.
2002-06-12	Honda Takes Up Case in U.S. for Green Energy	When it comes to fuel economy and the environment, there is Honda and there is the rest of the auto industry. The difference has come into sharp relief as battles rage over how to curb the nation's swelling appetite for oil.
2002-06-09	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Honda Pilot; A Line Forms for Preferred Seating	IN my neck of the suburbs, neighbors seldom glance twice at the flashy sports cars and sumptuous luxury sedans that I sometimes test-drive. But a crowd gathers when I roll up in one of the new sport utilities with three rows of seats. I've driven several of these new-millennium wagons lately, including the 2003 Honda Pilot, which went on sale last week. Still, it has been a while since any test car attracted so much attention or drew so many requests for hands-on demonstrations.
2002-05-31	G.M. Rises and Nissan Falls in J.D. Power Quality Survey	General Motors rose to third place in this year's quality ranking surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, the best performance for a domestic manufacturer since the study's methodology was changed in 1998. The Ford Motor Company also rose in the closely watched initial quality survey, which examines how cars perform in their first 90 days, as did DaimlerChrysler, the parent of the Chrysler Group. Ford moved from seventh place to fifth in the survey. DaimlerChrysler moved from fifth to fourth.
2002-05-29	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: More Autos Built	Japan's five largest automakers increased production at their plants overseas last month to meet growing demand in North America and elsewhere and to take advantage of lower costs. The Toyota Motor Corporation, the country's largest carmaker, increased production overseas by 37 percent in April, while Nissan raised output 23 percent. The Honda Motor Company, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and the Mazda Motor Corporation also raised production. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-05-16	National Briefing | Washington: Integra Leads Theft Totals	The Acura Integra, refashioned this year as the RSX, is stolen eight times more often than the average car in the 1999 and 2000 model years, according to a report by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurer-financed group. Based on insurance claims, the Honda-made Integra coupes and small sedans are also two and a half times more likely to be stolen than the second-ranking car, the Jeep Wrangler. Another Jeep, the Cherokee, was third. Peter T. Kilborn (NYT)
2002-05-15	Technology Briefing | Hardware: Fuel-Cell Research Pact	Honda Motor and Plug Power, a fuel-cell maker in Latham, N.Y., said they would study the possibility of developing dual-purpose Plug Power fuel cells that could provide household heat and power while producing the hydrogen needed to replenish fuel cells in hydrogen-powered cars Honda hopes to market later this decade. The fuel cells would consume natural gas, which is already readily available to many homeowners. The research agreement points to one of the auto industry's many efforts to develop the hydrogen-distribution infrastructure needed to migrate from gasoline-powered vehicles to designs based on fuel cells, which could be more efficient and environmentally benign. Plug Power shares rose 5.8 percent, to $10.63. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)
2002-05-02	Auto Sales Increased 2.9% in April; Only Ford Lagged	Every major automaker except Ford Motor reported sales increases last month, evidence of an economic recovery that helped propel the stock market today. Over all, automobile sales in the United States rose 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
2002-04-27	Honda Defies Market as Earnings Surge	The Honda Motor Company reported a surge in quarterly and annual earnings today as a weaker yen and demand for Honda's compact cars and minivans lifted sales in North America and in its home market. Helped by the popularity of the Fit compact car, Honda was the only major automaker to increase sales last year in Japan's shrinking market. Honda also excelled in the United States, where its Accord displaced the Toyota Camry as the top-selling car. Honda sells nearly twice as many cars in the United States as it does in Japan.
2002-04-14	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Honda Civic Hybrid; Getting Environmental Kicks on Route 66	WE have traced Route 66 for two days, but our adventures haven't measured up to those of Buz and Tod in the television series of the early 1960's. We have enountered no lynch mobs, game poachers or Las Vegas showgirls. Maybe it's the times. Maybe it's us. Maybe it's the car.
2002-04-05	Hybrid Arithmetic: Pay More, Fill Less	FOR a vehicle designed primarily for policy wonks, the hybrid car is surprisingly cool. Hybrids, which use more than one power source (usually gasoline and electricity), are designed to be more environmentally friendly than gas-powered cars. But they also represent the vanguard of car technology and, with only two models on the road until recently, they were unquestionably exotic. That has changed. Honda recently began offering a hybrid version of the ubiquitous Civic. The possibility that hybrids could become mainstream vehicles raises two complicated questions: do you try to save either your money or the planet?
2002-02-26	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Production Rises	Japan's largest automakers increased production and exports in January to meet demand in the United States. Toyota Motor, the market leader, increased worldwide production by 4.6 percent, while global output at Honda Motor was up by 7.4 percent. Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda Motor also had gains. Japanese carmakers have benefited from the zero interest financing campaigns introduced by their rivals in the United States. Ken Belson (NYT)
2002-02-10	Private Sector; Learning to Time the Market And Then, Who Knows?	Ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange has become one of those larger-than-life events, a moment of media attention akin to christening a ship. And the list of those eligible to perform the honor no longer includes just the usual titans of finance or founders of newly listed companies. These days, it includes heads of state, Hollywood celebrities, fashion models -- even a chimpanzee, when E*Trade was listed last year. But the bell ringers have always shared one trait: they were, well, alive. So history will be made again this Thursday when Asimo, the humanoid robot from Honda, whirs onto the balcony overlooking the trading floor, puts a mechanical finger on the bell switch and signals the start of another day.
2002-02-06	Weaker Yen and U.S. Sales Help Increase Honda's Profit	While many other Japanese manufacturers struggled, Honda Motor posted robust sales and profits in the last quarter of 2001, buoyed by a weaker yen and the popularity of new models in the United States and at home. Honda earned a net 82.2 billion yen ($621 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, 74 percent more than in the period in 2000. In yen terms, sales were up 11.4 percent from a year earlier, in part because Honda earns a large portion of its revenue in dollars, and those dollars bought almost 10 percent more yen in December than they did in September.
2002-01-29	Motorcycles Find Market In Brazil's Countryside	If you buy a motorcycle from Onelio Pimentel, you will be guest of honor at his monthly party in the town square. He will send you a card every year on your birthday. And he will always be waiting with a smile to show you the next new model. Mr. Pimentel, the 30-year-old business manager of the only Honda motorcycle dealer in this city of 72,000 on the banks of the Amazon, has good reason to grin. Despite an economic slowdown and an energy crisis that affected most of Brazilian industry, the number of motorcycles sold countrywide in 2001 jumped 20.5 percent, to 692,096. According to Abraciclo, the trade group for the two-wheeled sector, that makes it Brazil's highest-growth industry. Car sales grew around 9 percent in 2001, while overall industrial production is expected to have finished the year up only around 2 percent.
2002-01-20	Honda Has Bigger S.U.V. Plans	TOYOTA got there first with its Highlander. Now Honda is getting ready to wade into the market for midsize sport utility wagons with its Pilot, an eight-passenger vehicle that will go on sale in the summer. Like the popular and critically acclaimed Acura MDX on which it is based, the Pilot is designed on the architecture of the Accord sedan and Odyssey minivan. Thus, it will be a car-based utility vehicle with a unit body, rather than have a trucklike body on a separate frame. The Highlander is similarly built on the platform of the Camry sedan.
2002-01-20	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda CR-V; Popular, Well Priced, Newly Polished	A LITTLE more than a year ago, I drove a Honda CR-V through New England for a comparison test of five small S.U.V.'s -- ''cute utes,'' if you will. The others were the Hyundai Santa Fe, Ford Escape, Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4. The CR-V, which was introduced as a 1997 model, had the oldest design of the five, and our group of four test drivers agreed that it felt the most dated. All said that it was underpowered; that it drove the most like a nose-heavy, front-drive car; that it handled ploddingly in emergency maneuvers; and that it did not seem as sturdy or solid as the others, especially on rough roads. In the end, we ranked it dead last -- not a place where you'd expect to find a Honda.
2002-01-04	Incentives Prop Up Sales but May Haunt Carmakers Later	Auto sales, propelled by low-cost financing, finished the year slightly below a record set in 2000, according to data released today. But expectations for 2002 are pessimistic because of the economy as well as the dent that the incentives have probably made in demand. Carmakers ended 2001 with sales of about 17.1 million vehicles, down slightly from the record 17.3 million in sales a year earlier. Few analysts expected such a strong performance last summer, when industry sales were lagging, and the Sept. 11 attacks all but halted showroom traffic.
2001-12-27	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Auto Output Down	Four of Japan's five largest automakers reduced production in November as sales at home and in many export markets dried up. Toyota Motor, the world's third-largest carmaker, cut global production 4.6 percent, while Nissan Motor, Japan's No. 3 automaker, trimmed output 3.1 percent. Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda cut production more than 10 percent each. Only Honda Motor, helped by demand for its subcompacts and minivans in Japan, increased output. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-12-20	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Automakers Expect Small Sales Gain	The Toyota Motor Corporation and Honda Motor, Japan's two largest automakers, expect small gains in global sales in 2002. Toyota, which holds more than 40 percent of the Japanese market, expects sales to rise 2 percent when including the subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino. Exports are expected to fall 10 percent, but Toyota will offset the decline by increasing output at its plants overseas by 16 percent. Honda, meanwhile, expects global sales to rise 6 percent in 2002. Ken Belson (NYT)
2001-12-05	Honda Opens a U.S. Factory and a Front Against the Big 3	Top executives of Honda Motor criticized the Big Three today for what they view as a double standard on fuel economy. The executives said that domestic manufacturers were not willing to face the environmental implications of becoming increasingly reliant on sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles. ''Business and some social obligation have to be equally applied to the whole company,'' said Koichi Amemiya, chief executive of Honda's American operations, who was in Alabama to open a minivan assembly plant.
2001-10-31	Honda Profit Rose Sharply in Last Quarter	Profits were up sharply at Honda Motor in the quarter ended Sept. 30 because of strong sales, cost reductions and a favorable trend in exchange rates, the company said today. Net income rose 45.2 percent from the comparable period in 2000, to 84.3 billion yen ($691 million), on a 16.1 percent rise in sales. In North America, where Honda sells more than half its cars, sales rose 7.3 percent, but the positive effect on profits was amplified by a 14 percent fall in the yen's value against the dollar over the first half of Honda's fiscal year, which began on April 1.
2001-10-28	Inside an Acura, Simple Pleasures	IF I were a product-planning general for a European or American car company, I'd give my troops an assignment: Get out there and drive the Acura RSX Type-S. I would ask them to listen to the free-revving engine, to click through the six forward gears of its crisp, quick, nearly perfect transmission, to chirp the tires a couple of times on takeoff. (That's not hard to do.)
2001-10-28	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Acura RSX; Pocket Rocket With a Classy Cockpit	THIS is the moment for high-tech Japanese hot rods at bargain prices. First, Subaru introduced the WRX, a smoking fast, turbocharged version of its all-wheel-drive Impreza compact. Now the Acura division of Honda has come through with the RSX, a muscular front-drive coupe. Better yet, there is a more powerful, better handling variant called the Type-S. The RSX Type-S is a showcase for the performance technology that Honda offers those with Porsche tastes on Pabst budgets. Acura is guessing that the typical buyer will be a thrill-seeking male in his 20's. But at $23,650 loaded -- there are no factory options -- it could serve as spirited transportation for couples or very small families with mortgages to service and health insurance deductibles to pay.
2001-10-28	Anthrax Scare Trips Up Some Mail Campaigns	Many companies have altered their advertising campaigns to find an appropriate tone after the terror attacks. The anthrax scare has brought new challenges, especially for businesses that use direct mailings. Not everyone, though, has been able to react in time.
2001-10-19	Aging With Boomers, The Accord Turns 25	THE Honda Accord, the car that put the Japanese in the mainstream of the American auto market, is a quarter-century old. The first Accord arrived in dealer showrooms in June 1976 as a somewhat sporty but mostly practical hatchback that, while fairly compact, was larger than most Japanese cars of the time. A sedan version came three years later.
2001-10-03	Auto Sales Off in September, But Less Than Expected	United States auto sales slumped last month, but were better than analysts expected. A drought in auto sales after the attacks has already led to additional belt-tightening for an industry that was trimming as the economy worsened. Now, analysts say demand will plunge more sharply, leading to more production cuts, plant closings and layoffs.
2001-08-28	Most Japan Carmakers Report Gains in Global Production	Toyota Motor and Honda Motor led gains in global production among Japanese automakers in July as they raced to meet demand for new models at home and in the United States. Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, said global production rose 4.4 percent, to 439,020 vehicles, in July from July of last year.
2001-07-22	Drag Racing 21st-Century Style	Every weekend night, Newman Shiue, 21, an electrical engineering student at U.C.L.A., leaves the apartment he shares with two roommates, a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh and his Bruce Lee posters, and heads to North Hollywood in his sleek white Acura Integra GSR. Mr. Shiue and dozens of other young men converge on ''the track,'' a wide, deserted stretch of road in a dingy industrial area. Like the others, he zigzags around potholes to avoid scraping the lowered chassis of his street racer, its chrome exhaust pipe shimmering in the night.
2001-06-15	Wieden & Kennedy Chosen by Honda	The Honda Motor Company has consolidated its British creative advertising assignment by naming the London office of Wieden & Kennedy to handle that task as agency of record, effective at the beginning of 2002. Spending was estimated at $28 million. The decision came after a review that included Wieden & Kennedy and the two incumbent agencies, CDP in London, owned by Dentsu, and the Leith Agency in Edinburgh. CDP Media will continue handling media planning and buying.
2001-06-11	Patents; A new system uses TV instead of mirrors to help drivers see while backing up their cars.	SEEING where you are going while backing up a car is difficult -- the driver's perspective is limited and distorted. But three inventors from Minnesota say they can improve that by taking away a car's rear view mirrors. Kenneth Schofield, Mark Larson and J. Keith Vadas have won a patent for a backing-up system that uses small cameras to send a picture to a screen in the car. Their system will greatly reduce the blind spots to the sides and rear of the vehicle common with vehicles equipped with conventional rear view mirrors, they write in their patent.
2001-06-07	World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Hondas Recalled	Honda Motor said it would recall more than 100,000 vehicles made between January and April because of a manufacturing flaw in a wheel bolt. Because of the defect, a wheel bolt could break, causing the wheel to fall off, the company said. No accidents have been reported, the company said. The recall involves 19 types of vehicles, including the Accord, the Civic and the Stream, that were sold in Japan. Toyota said it was still checking to see if cars sold overseas were affected. Miki Tanikawa (NYT)
2001-05-25	Every Rock Band Needs Roadies When It Tours	CONVINCED that the MTV generation wants cars that relate to their lifestyles, and to their rock styles, several automakers are becoming music promoters. Volkswagen did it with its DriversFest 2000, featuring the Barenaked Ladies. Ford, which is using a ''Detroit Techno'' advertising theme for the Focus compact car, kicks off the Focus Detroit Electronic Music Festival this weekend and a national music festival this summer. And Honda has sent two popular bands on the road for the 2001 Civic Tour in customized Civics: blink-182's simply displays its logo, while Everclear's pays homage to its favorite holiday -- Halloween.
2001-05-24	Some Hybrid Vehicles Are Here; Their Tax Status Remains Vague	Last Thursday, Vice President Dick Cheney released an energy plan that recommended a $2,000 tax credit for hybrid vehicles, which mix gasoline and battery power. In theory, this was new. But it puzzled Bob Zubritsky, who had walked into a showroom in Morristown, N.J., the Saturday before and ordered a Toyota Prius, one of the two hybrids now on the market. The salesman gave him Internal Revenue Service Form 8834, ''Qualified Electric Vehicle Credit,'' which provides for a tax credit up to $4,000 for automobiles ''powered primarily by an electric motor.''
2001-05-19	Detroit Splits the Difference; Car-Based S.U.V.'s Are Unlikely to Stem Slide In Fuel Economy	Auto sales are shrinking and discounts have spread even to the largest sport utility vehicles. But sales have nearly tripled this year for one category of vehicles that is being marketed with virtually no discounts at all: sport utility vehicles based on car designs. New models like the Toyota Highlander, which shares the mechanical underpinnings of a Toyota Camry, and the Ford Escape, which is based on a Ford Contour sedan, represent a powerful new development in the American auto market.
2001-05-15	World Business Briefing | Asia: China: Honda Output	Honda Motor said it would spend 3.8 billion yen to increase production at its Accord plant in southern China. Honda, the Japanese automaker, said demand for the car was stronger than expected. It sold 32,000 Accords last year. The company said it planned to increase output to 50,000 cars this year and that the increased investment would push the plant's capacity even higher by late 2002. Meanwhile, General Motors' main joint venture in China sold just over 23,000 Buick sedans in 2000. Honda is one of the main competitors of General Motors in China. Craig S. Smith (NYT)
2001-03-22	Honda to Use Exhaust Device That It Says Will Cut Costs	Struggling to reduce its costly dependence on palladium, platinum and rhodium, the Honda Motor Company plans to begin using a new kind of catalytic converter technology that the company contends will cut its use of these precious metals by 50 to 70 percent without increasing air pollution. Catalytic Solutions Inc., a privately held company that invented the technology and is based in Oxnard, Calif., said it was in talks to sell the technology to other automakers as well, a move that could drive down the price of palladium in particular. Palladium is mainly used in catalytic converters and some laptop computer components, and its price has risen ninefold in the last five years, to $967.65 a troy ounce, on fears that supplies would prove inadequate for the needs of the auto and electronics industries.
2001-03-02	Vehicle Sales Held Strong Last Month	American consumers continued to flock to car dealerships in February despite the economic slowdown, producing another unexpectedly strong month for auto sales. Sales fell 6 percent last month from February 2000, but the year-earlier month had been one of the best in the industry's history because of lavish incentives. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was 17.5 million vehicles, in an industry that considers anything above 16 million vehicles to be an excellent month.
2001-02-22	HONDA LEAVES XFL	Honda has pulled out of the XFL, which will begin to give advertisers additional spots in the games to make up for the drop in ratings. In Week 3, NBC's XFL rating plunged 33 percent, to a 3.1 from a 4.6 last week, which itself had tumbled from a 9.5 for the inaugural game. Its ratings have declined 67 percent in two weeks.
2001-02-16	HONDA'S PROFIT FALLS	The Honda Motor Company said its group net profit fell 25 percent from the year-earlier quarter to 47 billion yen ($404 million) for the quarter ended Dec. 31. Increased sales in Japan and North America were overshadowed by the weak euro, which hurt sales in Europe, and by higher costs, the company said. Sales grew 9 percent. Auto sales increased 59 percent in North America and 29 percent in Japan. Miki Tanikawa (NYT)
2001-01-10	U.S. Issues Vehicle Ratings On Tendency to Roll Over	The Transportation Department today issued its first ratings of the resistance of vehicles to rolling over, a type of accident that kills more than 10,000 people every year and more than 60 percent of the people who die in sport utility vehicles. The ranking, based on a simple formula relating the vehicle's tread width to the height of its center of gravity, showed that cars are generally less likely to roll over and that sport utility vehicles are most likely to do so, with the Honda Motor Company's Accord sedan at the top and two General Motors sport utility vehicles at the bottom. But it also showed considerable variation within vehicle classes. Among 2001 model sport utility vehicles, one Chevrolet Blazer model rated one star, meaning a rollover risk of more than 40 percent in a single-vehicle crash. The best vehicles in that class scored three stars, meaning a 20 percent to 30 percent risk.
2001-01-04	Vehicle Sales Fell Sharply In December	Auto sales slowed precipitously last month, with domestic automakers reporting plunges of up to 18 percent from year-ago levels. Foreign automakers, though, escaped almost unscathed and gained market share. Ward's Automotive, an industry data service, calculated that overall sales fell 7.6 percent from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 15.4 million cars and light trucks.
2000-12-17	Four-Wheeled Wallflowers, Waiting for a Dance	FORGIVE me if you have heard this before: I love the Acura NSX, an $85,000-and-up supercar that you can take grocery shopping. And I am thoroughly smitten with the Honda S2000 roadster, a $30-something-thousand rocket with a little four-cylinder that has more power, for its size, than any other engine in any other mass-production car in the world. If you held a seance to channel those cars' restless spirits, the medium could be the unprepossessing Honda Prelude, a sporty coupe that rises well above its front-wheel drivetrain and economy-car parts.
2000-12-08	HONDA SAYS IT WILL REPLACE ACURA INTEGRA NEXT YEAR	Honda Motor said yesterday that it would replace the Acura Integra with a new car, the RS-X sports coupe, in July 2001 as it tries to build up sales of luxury vehicles in the United States. A prototype of the new car, the first equipped with a new high-efficiency engine to be offered in North America, will be exhibited at an auto show in Detroit in January, the company said.
2000-11-23	Humanoids That Can Do Tricks, Kick a Ball and Climb the Stairs	Perhaps envisioning the day when there is a robot in every living room, Sony and Honda are introducing prototypes of humanoid robots at the Robodex 2000 exhibition in Yokohama, Japan, on Friday. The Sony robot, the SDR-3X, is 20 inches high and weighs about 10 pounds. It can walk, distinguish between some colors, respond to 20 prerecorded words, kick a ball and balance on one shiny robot leg.
2000-11-19	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Prius; It's Easier to Be Green	TOYOTA executives describe their Prius as a ''real car.'' While that might sound like damning a product with faint praise, it is actually a compliment for an alternative vehicle. And they are right. The Prius, a so-called hybrid that uses both gasoline and electric power, avoids most of the drawbacks and inconveniences of other vehicles that are designed to be clean and fuel-efficient. Its emissions are among the lowest of any car on the road, and its fuel economy -- 48 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving -- is second only to that of the Honda Insight, another hybrid.
2000-11-12	Babes in the Woods: Putting 5 'Cute Utes' to the Test	SMALL sport utility vehicles are grabbing an ever-bigger chunk of the car market, and the hottest ones are cars at heart. They are designed like cars, with one-piece unit bodies, instead of like trucks, with separate bodies bolted to rugged frames. And they meld some car characteristics -- comfortable cabins, relatively responsive handling, compliant rides, reasonable fuel economy -- with the traits that have had people lining up for S.U.V.'s: good outward visibility, a ''commanding'' driving position, flexible cargo space and the bad-weather security of all-wheel drive. At prices in the low $20,000 range, these perky S.U.V.'s -- ''cute utes,'' in industry parlance -- are bargains compared with luxurious crossover vehicles like the $36,000 Lexus RX 300 and the $50,000 BMW X5.
2000-11-12	No Recount: Escape Wins	PLAYING musical driver's seats attunes one to a vehicle's personality, strengths and quirks. Solid and substantial, the Santa Fe exceeded my expectations. The much-improved RAV4 is impressive in many ways. But the Escape was the standout, striking a fine balance between fun and utility and capably handling every road, trail or track maneuver. 1. FORD ESCAPE -- Its V-6 was peppy, its transmission was smooth, its handling was quick and sharp, its steering was precise and linear -- no wonder the Escape felt best on-road or off. On the test track, it was the least likely to come unglued.
2000-11-12	Power and Poise Put Ford on Top	THREE years ago, when I had a chance to directly compare small sport utilities, they were easy to rank: Subaru Forester first, Honda CR-V second and Toyota RAV4 third. There are more players now, and they are better -- but harder to choose among. 1. FORD ESCAPE -- With an independent rear suspension and rack-and-pinion steering, the Escape handled accurately and predictably, and it rode well. On loose, washboard surfaces, it refused to skitter or skate. Although a four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission are standard, we drove a fancier XLT with a V-6 and four-speed automatic, which upshifted smoothly, downshifted quickly and didn't hunt for gears on hills. The economy rating is only 18 m.p.g. in town, but the Escape can tow 3,500 pounds -- by far the most in this group.
2000-11-09	HONDA'S PROFIT FALLS	Hurt by the strengthening yen, Honda Motor, which gets 73 percent of its revenue outside Japan, said its net group profit for the six months ended Sept. 30 fell 10.6 percent from the period a year earlier, to 122 billion yen ($1.1 billion), on slightly higher sales of 3.05 trillion yen ($28.4 billion). Honda reported selling 1.24 million cars, up 4.1 percent from the period a year earlier, and 2.55 million motorcycles, up 18.6 percent. Miki Tanikawa (NYT)
2000-11-02	U.S. Auto Sales Sag, Another Slowdown Sign	Not even aggressive discounting by automakers could lift sales of new cars and light trucks last month, and bloated inventories of unsold models have led to the closing for a week of 8 of the nation's 55 auto assembly plants. Auto sales are the first important economic indicator to come out at the beginning of each month, and today's results were another sign that growth in the American economy has been slowing somewhat recently. Although sales have leveled off at a high level by historical standards, they are increasingly being sustained by ever more generous rebates and low-rate loans, rather than by strong consumer demand.
2000-10-15	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Acura MDX; Through the Woods in Comfort	IF you come late to the party, you can make a grand entrance and be the center of attention, or you can find yourself so tardy that most of the guests have already gone home. There is no doubt that Acura has come very late to the luxury sport utility festivities. Its excuse is that its engineers were busy developing other vehicles, said Art St. Cyr, the project leader for the MDX team. So, instead of designing its own sport utility, Acura made due with a rebadged version of the Isuzu Trooper that it called the SLX. But the boxy SLX was out of sync with buyers looking for more luxurious S.U.V.'s. Mr. St. Cyr said that with only the SLX to offer, the company was losing 25 percent of its potential customers to the competition.
2000-10-01	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2001 Honda Civic; Honda Nominates Yet Another Conservative Ticket	AFTER just three decades in the American auto market, Honda is poised to sell a million cars and trucks in the United States this year. And it was the Civic that built the franchise. The first one arrived in 1973 as OPEC was shutting off the oil spigot. The Civic, then a tiny, efficient subcompact, was the right car in the right place at the right time. Now a substantial small car, the Civic remains a leader in high mileage and low emissions, and the redesigned 2001 model is arriving at a time of tight gas supplies and high prices.
2000-09-20	Honda Warns the Owners Of Over 500,000 Vehicles	The Honda Motor Company today became the third major Japanese company in the last month to issue an extensive product recall, warning owners of 551,924 vehicles that they might have potential oil leaks or audio wiring flaws that could cause fires. The recall was announced against a background of heightened sensitivity in corporate Japan about defective products. Earlier this month, the Transport Ministry punished the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation for systematically concealing consumer complaints about its cars and trucks for more than 20 years.
2000-08-20	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Lexus IS 300 and Acura 3.2 CL -- Who's That Knock, Knock, Knocking on BMW's Door?; A Fast Coupe That Gives Rivals a Run For the Money	SPORTY coupes come and go, but BMW's 3-Series reigns supreme, deftly deflecting all challengers to its throne. Now Acura has stepped up, drawn a bull's-eye on the Bimmer and taken aim. Acura's 3.2 CL, once a slightly fancier, more eccentrically styled version of the Honda Accord coupe, has been redone for 2001 with more style, size and substance. More important, it now has enough of a sporty edge, especially the Type S version, to make a direct challenge to two-door models in BMW's 3-Series.
2000-08-02	Car Sales Rise, Except at G.M. And Chrysler	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler said today that their sales fell in July, leaving both automakers unable to reduce their bloated inventories of unsold minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But Ford and foreign automakers announced strong sales last month and balanced inventories. Overall industry sales were very strong. While they did not quite match the torrid pace early this year, they were still brisk enough to suggest that consumer spending remained a powerful force in the American economy during July.
2000-07-07	HONDA ON TOP IN JAPAN	Claiming in June to have Japan's top-selling car for the first time, thanks to its remodeled Odyssey minivan, the Honda Motor Company displaced the Toyota Motor Corporation, which has led sales for more than a decade. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker overall, sold 14,639 Odyssey vans in June, 450 more than Toyota's subcompact Vitz, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. Toyota commands more than 40 percent of Japanese-made sales. The remodeled Odyssey was introduced in December, and sales in Japan have since reached about 70,000.
2000-06-04	Balancing Hybrids vs. Electrics on the Environmental Scale	HYBRID gas-electric cars can be clean and very fuel-efficient, and may, if automakers persuade regulators, be used to fill the quota for battery-electric cars that California, New York and Massachusetts plan to require. But engineers are learning that hybrids cannot accomplish everything that environmentalists want. That point was demonstrated at the end of the 12th running of an alternative-vehicle race, the American Tour de Sol, here on May 18, when race organizers set out to rank the competing cars on a variety of scales. One criterion was energy efficiency, which was measured on a miles-per-gallon basis for the hybrid vehicles that used gasoline or diesel fuel; for battery-electric vehicles, organizers came up with an equivalent measure based on how much fuel an electric utility would need at its power plant to make the electricity the vehicle consumed. Another criterion was the cars' potential contribution to global warming.
2000-06-04	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda Insight; High-Mileage, High-Stakes Hybrid	WITH gasoline prices pushing toward $2 a gallon in some parts of the country, Honda could not have picked a better time to bring out a car that gets 70 miles to the gallon on the highway. Sure enough, the Honda Insight, the first hybrid car to be sold in the United States, is off to a fast start, at least by the standards used to measure alternative vehicles. Honda has sold more than 1,100 of the futuristic-looking Insights since the car went on sale in December, and the company recently raised its sales target for this year to 6,500 cars, from 4,000. While even that new goal might seem small, it is double the number of purely electric cars sold by all manufacturers combined in the last few years.
2000-06-02	Auto Sales Declined 2% Last Month	Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of last year, the first year-to-year drop since the summer of 1998. Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors entirely accounted for the decline as other manufacturers posted record sales, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected decline in sales had begun. Only one in five buyers of new family vehicles pays cash; the rest rely on loans or leases, for which the monthly payments vary with interest rates. As a result, the auto industry is usually one of the first to feel the effects when the Federal Reserve starts pushing up interest rates, as it has done in recent months. Many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, have long watched for weak auto sales as an early indicator that the American economy might be slowing.
2000-05-26	Honda Plans OnStar For Acura Sedans	The Honda Motor Company, Japan's second-biggest automaker, is planningd to equip United States versions of its Acura sedans with the General Motors Corporation's OnStar satellite navigation and information devices starting in 2002. Financial terms were not disclosed. The Tokyo-based company will offer OnStar mobile communications services in Honda and Acura vehicles starting with the 2002 Acura RL luxury sedan sold in the United States. Honda will eventually offer OnStar in other models.
2000-05-23	Supreme Court Roundup; Court Overrules Law Restricting Cable Sex Shows	Declaring for the first time that programming on cable television is entitled to the highest level of First Amendment protection, the Supreme Court today struck down a federal law that required many cable systems to limit sexually explicit channels to late-night hours. The vote was 5 to 4, with an unusual lineup of justices, in a decision that, beyond the context of cable television, could pose obstacles to government efforts to regulate content in new media. Both sides agreed that shielding children from sexually explicit material, the purpose of the 1996 law, was a legitimate goal, but differed on the degree of constitutional ''flexibility'' the court should give the government in its effort to protect children.
2000-05-13	HONDA PROFIT FALLS	Japan's second-biggest automaker, the Honda Motor Company, said its fourth-quarter earnings fell 12 percent from a year earlier, less than expected, as the yen's strength offset record vehicle sales, producing the company's first full-year profit drop in six years. Honda, which relies more on United States sales than any other Japanese automaker, said net income fell to 62.7 billion yen ($580 million) in the three months that ended on March 31, while sales gained 1 percent, to 1.6 trillion yen. Honda said its net income was likely to fall 27.6 percent to 190 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 2001.
2000-05-07	In a Search for Hot Wheels, Buyers Hit a Dead End	AS Robert Forester watched his dealer pull up in a black Chrysler PT Cruiser to take him for a test drive, he decided on the spot that the retro-looking small van would join his family's fleet. ''I got in that PT Cruiser and fell in love,'' said Mr. Forester, who works for a printing and stationery business in Henderson, Tex., 150 miles east of Dallas.
2000-05-03	Auto Sales Keep to Torrid Pace Even as Loan Costs Rise	Rising interest rates, a volatile stock market and higher gasoline prices were expected to be slowing the American economy by now, especially the highly cyclical auto industry. Yet the stampede into the showrooms continues across the country, with every big domestic and foreign automaker announcing today that sales last month exceeded even last year's brisk pace. The buyers are people like Frank DiBernardino, a 52-year-old human resources consultant in Glen Mills, Pa., who bought a huge, indigo blue GMC Yukon for $42,300 last month. Interest rate increases did not affect him, he said, because he wrote a check for the entire cost of the full-sized sport utility vehicle, using the proceeds from stock he sold in February. Nor was he troubled by the high price of gasoline.
2000-04-11	HONDA PLANS PLANT IN ENGLAND	Only weeks after BMW sold its Rover unit in Britain, causing thousands of layoffs, the Honda Motor Company said it intended to build its new CR-V -- compact recreational vehicle -- four-wheel-drive car at its plant in Swindon, England. The Japanese company said it planned to build 20,000 cars this fiscal year and hire a significant number of new employees. Andrew Ross Sorkin
2000-04-04	Robust Sales Push U.S. Auto Industry to Its Best Quarter Ever	Americans bought new cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles at a sizzling pace last month, closing out the best quarter ever for the auto industry as the nation's economy appeared to be following up a winter of brisk economic growth with a springtime of continued strong expansion. Ford Motor said today that its sales in the United States leaped 7.2 percent from a year earlier to the highest level ever for a single month. Four other big automakers had their best March ever: DaimlerChrysler, up 4.4 percent from last year; Toyota, up 16 percent; Honda, up 20.3 percent; and Mitsubishi, up 25.4 percent.
2000-03-26	DaimlerChrysler Nears Deal To Buy 33.4% of Mitsubishi	In another big move toward the global consolidation of the automobile industry, DaimlerChrysler of Germany is to announce a deal tomorrow to acquire 33.4 percent of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors for about $1.3 billion, people close to the companies said yesterday. The deal would make DaimlerChrysler the world's third-largest automaker, behind General Motors and Ford. All three will now have large shares of the three main markets: Western Europe, Japan and the United States. The other giants of the auto industry, Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda and the Renault-Nissan alliance, still are weak in at least one of these markets.
2000-03-23	Gentlemen, Merge Your Manufacturers; Consolidation Hits on Virtually All Cylinders	The consolidation of the global auto industry has reached a full-throttle roar as automakers around the world respond to the changing economics of the business. The list of companies partly or entirely acquired by other manufacturers in the last two years was impressive even before the frenzy of the last two weeks: Chrysler, Volvo Cars, Nissan, Saab, Fuji Heavy Industries, Suzuki, Daihatsu, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Since the beginning of last week, General Motors has agreed to buy a fifth of Fiat; Ford Motor has agreed to buy Land Rover from BMW; and DaimlerChrysler has moved close to taking a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Daewoo and Samsung are both up for sale in Korea, with deals likely later this year.
2000-03-02	Auto Sales in February Near Monthly Record	The United States auto industry is poised to have its second-best month for sales ever after the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported higher vehicle sales for February today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate is expected to be about 19 million cars and light trucks when the few remaining companies report sales on Thursday. That would put February sales in second place after September 1986, when the rate was 21.2 million vehicles.
2000-02-02	Newest and Trendiest Autos Bring Americans to Dealers	Americans flocked to dealerships last month to buy the most recently introduced and most fashionable cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles available, automakers said today, as every manufacturer except DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced big gains in sales. The three increases of a quarter percentage point each in short-term interest rates last year by the Federal Reserve seemed to have had no effect on the torrid pace in the auto market last month. The Fed is widely expected to respond to inflationary pressures in the economy by raising rates further on Wednesday. But auto executives remained optimistic that the industry this year would nearly match the record-setting pace of 1999.
2000-01-22	As Thefts Fall, New Yorkers Find Car Where They Left It	It has not been the cars that have been vanishing lately in New York City. It has been the thieves. During the last decade, as crime declined throughout the city, none of the major felonies tracked by the Police Department -- not murder, not rape, not robbery and not assault -- fell as sharply as auto theft.
2000-01-11	G.M. Agrees to Purchase Remaining Half of Saab	The General Motors Corporation said today that it would buy the half of Saab Automobile A.B. that it did not already own. The move could bring new customers into the G.M. fold and reduce European production costs. By purchasing the portion owned by the investment company Investor A.B., G.M. would be exercising a buy option it has held since the summer of 1996. G.M. and Investor have shared ownership of the Swedish automaker since 1990, and the latest deal is expected to close by the end of January, when the option was scheduled to expire.
2000-01-01	Detroit Plays Catch-Up In Race for Hybrid Car; With Fewer Subsidies, Japan Is Ahead	With hundreds of millions of dollars of private and federal research work behind it, the General Motors Precept, an experimental model to be introduced here on Jan. 9, is probably the most expensive single car ever built. Yet it is still a lot of car for the money. In place of side-view mirrors, which cause a lot of wind resistance, it has tiny cameras, mounted on the front doors, that send images to the dashboard. Rather than the smooth, rounded contours commonly associated with aerodynamic design, carefully angled body panels are designed to give the six-passenger Precept far less wind resistance than a Corvette sports car. And instead of a gasoline engine, the car has two electric motors, batteries under the seats and a rear diesel engine to charge the batteries and provide additional power and range.
1999-12-04	G.M. Is Said to Be in Talks To Buy Engines From Honda	The General Motors Corporation appears intent on expanding its relationships with Japanese automakers, and is talking with the Honda Motor Company about a three-way deal in which G.M. would use engines designed by Honda in cars G.M. builds in North America. The negotiations, the second potential deal with a Japanese automaker disclosed this week, also involve Isuzu Motors.
1999-12-02	G.M. and DaimlerChrysler Report Weak Monthly Sales	General Motors and DaimlerChrysler announced November sales figures today that were weaker than expected as American automakers continued to lose market share to Japanese rivals, who posted big gains. G.M. said its sales in the United States inched up just one-tenth of a percent last month compared with figures in the period a year earlier, several percentage points worse than expected, while DaimlerChrysler said its sales fell 1.3 percent last month, marginally worse than expected. But Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and particularly Nissan Motor all reported large increases, while sales for Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled.
1999-11-14	BEHIND THE WHEEL/2000 Honda S2000; The Little Engine That Could	ANOTHER roadster, you say? Ho-hum. Been there, drove that. But hold your horsepower: Check out the Formula One-style tachometer that arcs over the instrument displays of the Honda S2000: The red line -- the limit of where the engine can safely be run -- is just short of 9,000 revolutions per minute. That's surely a mistake; only superbikes rev that fast. Doesn't the new Ferrari Modena top out at 8,500 r.p.m.?
1999-11-10	HONDA EARNINGS FALL	The big Japanese car maker Honda Motor reported sharply lower earnings for the second quarter. Although unit sales of cars, engines and generators were higher, the strong yen eroded profits, which fell 20.7 percent, to 63.5 billion yen, from the corresponding period last year. Almost 80 percent of Honda's operating profits come from its sales in the United States, making it especially sensitive to exchange rates. Stephanie Strom
1999-11-03	Foreign Nameplate Autos Are Sales Favorites in U.S.	Buyers snapped up cars and trucks with foreign nameplates last month, forsaking some of their past favorites -- American-made sport utility vehicles. Nearly every foreign brand reporting sales results today showed increases, and many notched double-digit gains. Toyota sales rose 12.6 percent in October compared to the same period a year ago. Honda sales rose 3.2 percent and Nissan jumped 27.6 percent.
1999-10-06	William Wegman's dogs take the plunge into TV commercials for the Honda Odyssey minivan.	A CANINE ''family'' is being enlisted to help stimulate sales in a product category where the competition resembles a, well, dogfight. (After this, no more doggone puns will be unleashed on you.)
1999-10-02	Auto Makers Finish Record Year on Strong Note	Customers drawn by hefty rebates bought more than 16 million new cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in the 1999 model year, breaking the sales record set in 1986. ''These are good times,'' said Roy S. Roberts, group vice president for sales, service and marketing for the General Motors Corporation, which had its best model-year results in a decade. ''The combination of affordable vehicles, high employment and buying momentum continues to propel us to record levels.''
1999-10-01	AUTOS ON FRIDAY /Technology; Looking Under the Hood of a Hybrid Honda	HONDA and Toyota started with the same concept, an automobile powered by both an internal-combustion engine and an electric motor, and each company will begin shipping such hybrid cars to dealers in a few months, the first of what environmentalists hope will be a flood of innovative cars from companies around the world. But the two Japanese companies that will be the first to market have assembled similar ingredients into products as different as a potato chip is from a French fry. The Honda Insight will be in showrooms by December, the first mass-produced hybrids offered for sale in this country. Two-seaters vaguely reminiscent of the Honda CRX, which went out of production in 1992, they will have an E.P.A. fuel economy rating of more than 70 miles a gallon, the company said, and will sell for less than $20,000, including amenities like keyless entry and power windows (although with only a manual transmission, at least for now). With a range of 600 to 700 miles on a 10.4-gallon tank of plain old unleaded gasoline, they avoid the electric car's dilemma of where to recharge and then, after 100 miles or so, where to recharge again, and then again.
1999-09-21	A Web-Researched Ford in Microsoft's Future	A joint venture of the Microsoft Corporation with the Ford Motor Company, offering built-to-order automobiles via the World Wide Web, shows the potentially wrenching changes that electronic commerce is bringing in its wake. At a news conference here today, Microsoft and Ford executives took pains to argue that their venture -- allowing on-line customers to configure their own cars and obtain detailed information on product availability -- would not displace the traditional role of the car dealer.
1999-09-19	If They Huff and They Puff, Can Motorists Find a Place for the Ashes?	IN the days when Johnny Carson conducted TV interviews wreathed in cigarette smoke, huge drawer-like ashtrays took center stage in automobiles. But as cup holders have ascended, the ashtray has declined. As the percentage of Americans who smoke has fallen to about 25 percent (down from 40 percent in the early 60's), auto makers are shrinking their ashtrays -- the Lincoln LS's is barely two inches square -- or dispensing with them as standard equipment. Instead, they offer optional ''smoker's kits,'' which typically include a fireproof insert for a cup holder along with what was once an immutable fixture in cars: a cigarette lighter.
1999-09-02	Auto Sales Rose Sharply In August	In a sign that strong consumer spending continued to power the American economy last month, many auto makers announced today that their sales soared in August, with the biggest growth occurring for some of the most expensive models with the highest profits. DaimlerChrysler A.G. said that its Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep and Mercedes-Benz brands had their best August ever, together climbing 9.6 percent from already brisk sales in August 1998. Honda Motor reported that its sales had climbed 10.5 percent in August from a year earlier, to the highest level ever for any month, while Toyota Motor reported its best August ever in the United States with a 2.8 percent increase.
1999-07-21	American Honda Cuts 2 Agencies	The American Honda Motor Company unexpectedly dismissed two roster agencies yesterday by consolidating general-market national and regional advertising assignments for its two car brands, Honda and Acura, at Rubin Postaer & Associates in Santa Monica, Calif. The dismissed agencies are Suissa Miller in Los Angeles, which had handled creative duties for Acura, and Western Initiative Media in Los Angeles, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which had handled Acura media duties. Rubin Postaer adds billings for Acura, estimated at $190 million, to its Honda billings, estimated at $300 million.
1999-07-13	U.S. Lawsuit Faults Toyota On Pollution Warning Lights	The Federal Government sued Toyota today, accusing it of violating the Clean Air Act by selling 2.2 million automobiles on which the ''check engine'' light would not illuminate even when the vehicles were emitting excessive pollution. The lawsuit, which theoretically could involve penalties of as much as $60 billion, came after Toyota rejected an offer to settle the case out of court. It is the latest in a series of similar disputes pitting the Government against auto makers and truck makers. In each case, the Government has contended that the vehicles' computer diagnostic equipment had been programmed to meet Federal standards during laboratory tests, but not during actual driving on the road.
1999-06-23	HONDA'S DOMESTIC PROFITS	A big Japanese auto maker, the Honda Motor Company, managed to stay profitable, though only modestly, in the domestic market as robust sales overseas drove net income to a record 305 billion yen in the year that ended on March 31, the company's president, Hiroyuki Yoshino, said in an interview.
1999-06-03	Vehicle Sales Increased by 5.3% in May	Auto executives were exuberant today as May's car and truck sales propelled the industry toward its best year ever. Despite weak results from the General Motors Corporation, the industry's sales rose 5.3 percent in May compared with results in the period a year earlier, when sales were also stellar. Last month's seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 17.3 million was surpassed only by a rate of 17.8 million set in December 1986. Anything more than an annual rate of 15 million rate is considered strong.
1999-06-03	A Boom Built on Big Wheels; Sales of Light Trucks Drive the Auto Industry's Expansion	Craig J. Thomas stands near the end of DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s assembly line in Fenton, Mo., and waits for a spindly orange robot to lower a pickup bed to meet the rest of a Dodge Ram truck. Then, 37 times an hour, 300 times a day, he bolts the bed to the truck and waits for the next pickup to reach him. In mid-May, he got a break from the rhythm of the robots to celebrate with other workers: the company said it would spend $435 million to expand the Ram factory.
1999-05-29	Clean Cars Get Real; Makers of Hybrid Vehicles Add Fuel to Electric Mix	The annual showcase for electric cars, the Tour de Sol race, was so crowded this year that organizers were forced to turn some entrants away. But the crowded field was not so much a result of electric vehicles finally catching on as it was the new emphasis on another class of vehicles invited to join. These cars, known as hybrids, use batteries and electric motors, but also depend on gasoline or diesel engines as well. In a change that might have horrified the purists who ran in the first race 11 years ago -- when there were only five participants and not all of them could finish the course -- the event was held in conjunction with a conference on hybrid vehicles, organized with the Society of Automotive Engineers.
1999-05-19	From Mother's Ugly Duckling To Chic and Expensive Swan	CINDY BURROWS had it all: a successful husband, three bright, attractive children and a showplace home on Philadelphia's Main Line with a fully loaded, leather-upholstered Chrysler Town and Country van in the driveway. Then her oldest son went away to college and her true feelings emerged. ''I hate vans,'' she said. ''The only reason I bought one was because I was driving three kids around. As soon as Jeb went away to college, I started looking for something different.''
1999-05-19	Where to Put the Golf Clubs? Right Next to the Hydrogen!	THE two small cars that rolled up to the State Capitol in Sacramento did not seem much different from other cars -- until you saw the hydrogen tanks in their trunks. The vehicles, one by DaimlerChrysler and the other by Ford, were propelled by fuel cells, which are nonpolluting and are seen by many experts as the technology that will replace the gasoline-burning internal-combustion engine. The event in Sacramento last month marked a milestone. Ford and DaimlerChrysler, along with the State of California, announced that the auto makers would test up to 50 of their new vehicles over the next few years, a sign that fuel cells are stepping out of the laboratory and onto the road.
1999-05-15	Honda Says U.S. Sales Lifted Profit in Quarter	The Honda Motor Company of Japan said yesterday that its profit unexpectedly rose in the January-March period as booming sales in the United States compensated for declines in Asia and Europe.
1999-05-07	Honda Plans to Build Plant in Alabama for Larger Vehicles	In the latest sign that foreign auto manufacturers are shifting toward bigger vehicles and moving south in the United States, Honda announced today that it would build a factory in rural Alabama to assemble large sport utility vehicles and Odyssey minivans. The Honda Motor Company said that it would spend $400 million to erect the factory in Lincoln, 40 miles east of Birmingham. The Mercedes division of DaimlerChrysler A.G. makes its M-class sport utility vehicles in Tuscaloosa, Ala., which is 50 miles southwest of Birmingham, while Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G. is preparing to produce BMW X5 sport utility vehicles in Spartanburg, S.C., for sale beginning in November. ''It's certainly going to be sport utility alley down there,'' said Michael E. Robinet, the director of forecast services at CSM Worldwide Inc., based in Northville, Mich.
1999-05-04	Several Big Auto Makers Posted Robust April Sales	In a further sign of consumers' willingness to keep spending in a robust economy, auto sales maintained their sizzling pace in April. The Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G., Toyota, Honda and Nissan, along with a number of smaller auto makers, reported strong sales today, and the industry as a whole is on track to match or beat its vigorous sales pace of last April.
1999-05-02	It's the Extras That Count	VIRTUALLY every manufacturer has minivan ergonomics down pat. After all, functionality, comfort and convenience are the reasons people drive these mobile dens. So other factors now count: Four doors have become essential for convenience (and for children's safety on one-way streets). Power-operated sliding doors win extra credit. I also appreciate extra horsepower and nimble, car-like handling. Clever ideas, like well-placed storage nets and power outlets, are a big plus.
1999-05-02	Rating Vans: Who Has the Best Family Room for the Road?	CHRYSLER created the modern minivan, and for 15 years it has successfully fended off the arrows of a pack of challengers. But the rivals keep coming with ever more potent weapons, including new vans this year from Ford and Honda (on the heels of improved competition from General Motors and Toyota). But just as van makers figured out what customers want in a family vehicle -- from extra doors to cup holders to secondary music sources with headphone jacks -- the market has cooled. Although sales have picked up nicely this year, they remain below their 1994 peak, and rebates and discounts are common. Sport utility vehicles are one reason, and rebellion against the vans' soccer-mom image is another.
1999-05-02	From Skeptic To Admirer	I HAD not cared much for minivans, preferring the handling of even a station wagon over these boxes on wheels. Then I took a family trip in a Plymouth Grand Voyager, hauled home a Christmas tree on the roof of a Toyota Sienna and took some Cub Scouts camping in a Ford Windstar.
1999-04-07	Pension Fund At Nissan Has $4.76 Billion Shortage	The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, detailed the extent of its pension financing shortage today, disclosing a gap almost twice as large as analysts had expected. A spokesman, Masataka Saito, said the shortage in Nissan's consolidated pension fund was 580 billion yen, or $4.76 billion at current exchange rates, based on a relatively conservative assumed rate of return of 3.5 percent.
1999-03-31	Requiem for the Middleweights; Ho-Hum Taurus Marks End of Midsize Sedan as Style's Pace Car	Remember the first Ford Taurus? When the car was introduced in late 1985, its smooth, aerodynamic curves shook up the design of midsize sedans. And despite fears that its radical look would turn off car buyers, sales took off almost immediately. Moreover, its success was one of the early signs of the resurgence of the Ford Motor Company, which today is at the brink of surpassing the General Motors Corporation as the largest auto maker in the world. Well, Ford just unveiled the new Taurus yesterday at the New York International Auto Show. But do not look for any surprises. While it may sell well if it is priced cheaply enough, it is unlikely to win any contests for style. Indeed, the most distinctive thing about the new Taurus is probably how indistinguishable it is from all the other lookalike midsize sedans.
1999-03-12	AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology; Variable Transmission Wins New Disciples	WHILE driving the Honda Civic HX coupe, one immediately senses that something is missing. Step hard on the accelerator when a stoplight turns green, or press the pedal to the floor to pass on a freeway, and there is no jerk as the transmission shifts gears. Nor does the sound of the engine rise just before a shift, along with its speed, and then fall off. The tachometer's needle holds steady. Indeed, the car feels as though its transmission is not shifting at all.
1999-03-04	Report Says Buyers Can Choose Clean Cars or Clean Factories	For environmentalists in the market for a new car, the choice is not an easy one. According to the Council on Economic Priorities, an environmental group based in New York, car buyers face a rock-and-a-hard-place choice: They can buy cars that were made in nonpolluting plants or cars that run clean themselves, but they cannot do both.
1999-03-03	Major Auto Makers Report Record Sales	Most major auto makers, including the Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G. and American Honda, reported record sales for February. ''Since the end of the General Motors strike in August, the industry has had an incredible run of monthly records,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham Securities in New York. ''The reasons are the usual suspects. Car prices are reasonable, if not declining. Employment levels and consumer confidence are very high. Used-car prices are strong, making trade-ins worth more and causing people to buy new cars instead of used ones.''
1999-02-19	HONDA MOTOR SAYS EARNINGS CLIMBED 16% IN 4TH QUARTER	The Honda Motor Company said yesterday that earnings increased 16 percent in the latest quarter as sales in the United States of more profitable cars made up for a decline in revenue. Honda compensated for weaker sales in Japan and Europe by selling Odysseys and Acura TL luxury sedans in the United States, whose auto market has been strong. During 1998's fourth quarter, Honda's group net income rose to a record 75.5 billion yen, or $636 million, from 65.2 billion yen a year before. Analysts had expected earnings of about 71.8 billion yen. Sales fell 3.9 percent, to 1.49 trillion yen from 1.55 trillion yen. North American sales rose 6 percent, to 780.27 billion yen.
1999-02-17	Honda Seeks China Sales	The Honda Motor Company, Japan's third-largest auto maker, said today that it would open about 100 sales outlets in China by April 2001 as it starts producing cars in China, the world's most populous country. Honda will open 30 outlets jointly with Chinese automobile dealers next month when Chinese production of the midsize Accord sedan begins, Yuzuru Matsuno, a Honda spokesman, said. Production will be at Honda's factory in Guangzhou, where the company expects to produce 100,000 Accords by 2001.
1999-01-07	Auto Industry Finds Surprises At the End of a Rainbow Year	Last month was the best for auto sales since December 1986, lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in a dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from which the General Motors Corporation has not fully recovered. With the last auto makers reporting their results today, the industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month from December 1997. For the year, a total of 15.55 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8 percent increase from 1997.
1999-01-06	Auto Makers Up On Merger Rumors	Shares in the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company rose sharply today in the Tokyo stock market on rumors that the auto makers may be acquired by foreign competitors. Automotive executives called the rumors untrue. Honda rose 170 yen, about 5 percent, to 3,680 yen, to lead both the Nikkei and Topix indexes higher after Agence France-Presse reported that the Ford Motor Company was working to buy Japan's No. 3 auto maker and Germany's BMW A.G.
1998-12-06	A '-San' Snares a 'Sir'	You can almost hear the bureaucrats at Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry gnashing their teeth: Queen Elizabeth has knighted Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the former president and chief executive of the Honda Motor Company. Years ago, when the ministry was trying to protect Japan's auto industry leaders, Toyota and Nissan, it discouraged bankers from lending to Honda, then a motorcycle maker. The strategy failed, and Honda is now a global giant, producing 150,000 vehicles a year in Swindon, England, with plans to increase capacity by 100,000. A total of 31 other Japanese executives, including Soichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, have also achieved British knighthood.
1998-11-13	Japanese Slump Aside, Profit Is Up at Honda and Mazda	Despite recent trouble in the Japanese auto industry, the Honda Motor Company and the Mazda Motor Corporation reported impressive profit gains today for the first half of the fiscal year. Japan's car makers have faced slumping sales in the domestic market, a credit squeeze and a recent unfavorable swing in dollar-yen exchange rates. Earlier this week, the Nissan Motor Company, the nation's troubled No. 2 car maker, posted a loss and revised its outlook for the fiscal year from flat to negative. And last Friday, Mitsubishi Motors announced a major reorganization and continued losses in the first half.
1998-11-04	Chrysler Sales in October Increased 20% Over a Year Ago	The Chrysler Corporation reported today that its October car and truck sales rose 20 percent over a year ago, indicating yet another strong month for vehicle sales industrywide despite waning consumer confidence. Chrysler sold 226,179 cars and trucks this October. Its percentage increase over the corresponding period last year is significantly larger than that of many other auto makers because of a particularly weak October last fall. At that time, Chrysler was in the process of introducing some critical new products and its plants were not making those new vehicles at expected capacity.
1998-10-21	How Do You Add Up Sales Figures? Let Us Count the Ways	WHAT is America's most popular car? It depends on what you mean -- the car bought by the most people or the car that sells the most over all? The difference lies in fleet sales -- these are sales to rental car companies, to corporations and to government agencies that provide cars for their employees, along with sales to businesses that operate fleets of company cars for other corporations. Fleet sales can turn a runner-up into a winner.
1998-10-21	Making Its Marque at the Top; Toyota's Lexus Offers a Lesson in Brand Development	Ellen Passe sat in the passenger seat of an RX 300, the new Lexus midsized sport utility vehicle, while her 2-year-old son, Alex, fiddled with the steering wheel. Outside the car, her husband, Michael, spoke with a salesman at a midtown Manhattan Lexus dealership. ''Where are my heated seats?'' Ms. Passe asked good naturedly. The salesman quickly pointed to a small button near the CD player. Ms. Passe smiled.
1998-10-18	BEHIND THE WHEEL/ 1999 Honda Odyssey; The New Life of the Minivan Party	CHRYSLER threw a party here recently to mark the 15th anniversary of the minivan -- a vehicle it invented. The entertainment included film footage of the first advertisement for a minivan, which featured the magician Doug Henning. He demonstrated the innovative features like the front-facing third-row seat, the sliding door for back-seat passengers, the cargo bay and the low step into what he called the ''magic box.''
1998-10-09	Honda Is Joining Roadster Competition With S2000	FIRST it was the BMW Z3. Then the Mercedes-Benz SLK230 Kompressor followed. On its heels came the Porsche Boxster. This spring the Audi TT arrives. Now, Honda has announced that its S2000 two-seat roadster prototype, which was unveiled in Japan recently to mark the company's 50th anniversary, will go on sale in the United States next summer as a 2000 model.
1998-09-03	Honda to Sell Stake In Venture to Partner	The Honda Motor Company plans to sell its 51 percent stake in Kinetic Honda Motor Ltd. to its joint venture partner, Kinetic Engineering Ltd., based in Bombay, India, for $8.1 million. A joint statement said Honda would continue to provide technical support to Kinetic Honda. Kinetic Honda will continue using Honda's network for exporting its vehicles under the Honda name, the statement said.
1998-09-02	Chrysler Sales Break a Record for August	Sales of Chrysler cars and trucks rose 3.5 percent in August, setting a record for the month, though they were off from the blistering pace of the spring. The Chrysler Corporation sold 186,469 cars and trucks in August, up from 180,131 vehicles in August 1997. The previous August record was set in 1996, when the auto maker sold 186,306 vehicles. This spring, Chrysler had been selling more than 200,000 vehicles a month.
1998-08-04	Yen Hits Seven-Week Low Against the Dollar	The yen fell to its lowest level against the dollar in seven weeks today, as currency traders tested the new Japanese Government's resolve to let the market determine the currency's value. At 5 P.M. today, one dollar could buy 145.63 yen, up from 144.79 yen when trading opened this morning and from 144.70 yen late Friday in New York. [The yen slipped more on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported, trading at 145.72 to the dollar early in the day, but its slide was limited because a Finance Ministry official said that Japan might act to buoy the sagging yen.]
1998-08-04	Chrysler Sales Rose 3% in July, After Even Busier Spring	The Chrysler Corporation announced today that its sales of cars and trucks in July were up slightly from levels a year earlier but down from the brisk pace of the previous two months. Chrysler's sales totaled 206,018 cars and trucks, up 3 percent from the level in July 1997. In both May and June this year, when incentives to buyers were in place, Chrysler sales hit 250,000 units, reaching that level for the first time ever, and inventories were lowered on dealer lots. Still, July marked the sixth consecutive month of sales exceeding 200,000 units.
1998-07-29	Honda Dealers Said to Settle Suit	The Honda Motor Company has tentatively agreed to pay more than $316 million to settle a lawsuit filed by dealers who contended that the auto maker had conspired to ship fewer cars to dealers who refused to pay kickbacks to Honda executives, people close to the case said today. Honda's United States unit said it had reached an agreement with lawyers representing as many as 1,000 dealers in a class-action suit here. The dealers argued that they had been unfairly denied hot-selling Accords and Acuras.
1998-07-26	BEHIND THE WHEEL/General Motors EV1, Toyota RAV4-EV, Honda EV Plus; Charge! Doing an Electric Commute	A TURTLE icon suddenly lit up on the dashboard of my Toyota RAV4 Electric Vehicle. The car's batteries were exhausted and I had entered ''limp home mode,'' which would allow me to putter along at a reduced speed for a few miles to make it back to a charger. But instead of slowing down, the car stalled completely on a dark street a mile from my home. Panicked, I jumped out, pushed the car to the side of the road and began scrounging for coins to call a tow truck.
1998-07-05	The High School at the End of the Road	In august 1996, jerry mcginnes, a sulking, brooding 18-year-old, awaited sentencing in a Fort Collins, Colo., courtroom. His tattoos -- the sun and a cross on his forearms and unintelligible markings on his knuckles, a result of a drunken evening -- lent Jerry an air of defiance. The Juvenile Court magistrate, Joseph Coyte, asked if he had anything to say. Jerry, who had dropped out of school, had been on probation for stealing a car when he cut off his ankle monitor and fled for San Diego to live with his sister. There, he smoked marijuana and hung out until deciding he'd had enough of being on the run. He then turned himself in. The prosecutor asked that the judge send him to a youth prison. Jerry rose; his hands, manacled and shaking, clutched a penciled four-page letter he had written. He read it aloud. Magistrate Coyte,
1998-06-09	HONDA AND FORD ARE FINED MILLIONS	Honda and Ford have agreed to pay millions of dollars in civil fines for selling cars that were designed to pass emissions tests but run dirtier on the road, Federal prosecutors announced today. The Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency fined the Honda Motor Company $12.6 million for violations of the Clean Air Act. The E.P.A. said the auto maker would also face costs of about $250 million for remedial efforts, including extending warranties and providing free tune-ups for the 1.6 million cars that are affected.
1998-06-03	Sales of Chrysler Vehicles Jumped 27% in May to a Record	The Chrysler Corporation said today that sales of its cars and trucks in the United States rose 27 percent in May, making it the best sales month ever for the No. 3 auto maker. Chrysler's car sales rose 4.7 percent, to 73,452 vehicles, from May 1997. Truck sales rose 39 percent, to 176,579, a percentage increase magnified because of a United Automobile Workers strike at an important truck-engine plant last year. The total, 250,031 vehicles, beat the previous record of 245,289 in May 1996.
1998-05-09	INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Japan's Auto Makers Go It Alone; Tradition Creates Resistance to Industry's Consolidation	Standing inside the dormitory he manages for the Nissan Motor Company, Mutsumi Goto looked a bit befuddled by the whirlwind on the other side of the world. ''It's an epoch-making event and I feel a little bit left behind,'' he said.
1998-05-08	Mergers Help Fuel a Two-Tier Global Auto Hierarchy	The global auto industry is increasingly divided into two tiers, as a half-dozen giant companies prosper while many of their smaller rivals struggle to manage heavy debts or afford the ever-rising cost of designing new cars. With the pending completion of today's acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz A.G., each of the world's three major auto-producing regions will have two successful, global auto makers. Toyota and Honda are thriving in Japan. General Motors and Ford are enjoying record profits in the United States. Volkswagen and the new DaimlerChrysler, which will have German and American executives but will be dominated by European shareholders, will be the strongest auto makers based in Europe.
1998-04-28	Honda Chief to Step Down; Few Changes Are Expected	Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the engineer who has led Honda to record profits and market shares in the United States and Japan over the last eight years, announced yesterday his retirement as president and chief executive. Hiroyuki Yoshino, one of the Honda Motor Company's two executive vice presidents and the president of Honda's research and vehicle development division, was chosen to succeed Mr. Kawamoto.
1998-03-29	Go West: New Sport Brutes Square Off on the Utah Buttes	MONUMENT VALLEY, that collection of impossibly beautiful buttes, mesas, canyons and valleys in southeast Utah and northeast Arizona, is an excellent place to test the mettle of sport utility vehicles. There are great roads, good roads, bad roads, rocky roads, dirt roads and no roads, with natural wonders waiting no matter which route you take. Three couples, including four automotive writers, gathered in Southern California in late January with a mission: We would take the pulse of five newborn sport utility vehicles on a 2,200-mile trip through the desert Southwest, seeing how they compared in the kind of environment for which they are designed (but all too rarely see).
1998-03-08	Daytona Beach Journal; Bikers Flash Chrome, and Gold Card	In the black leather, exhaust pipe extravaganza known as Bike Week, close to half a million motorcycle enthusiasts descended on this city of about 63,000 residents to partake of the engine revving, beer drinking and girlfriend flaunting of biker lore. Bars still post ''No Colors'' signs that forbid patrons from wearing identifying jackets that could provoke brawls between rival motorcycle clubs. Contests held throughout the city and the rest of Volusia County's coast during the annual 10-day event that ends on Sunday cater to the taste of the rough: ''Ladies arm wrestling,'' ''Biggest beer belly,'' ''Great cleavage,'' ''Best tattoo'' and ''Bikini pull-off.''
1998-03-04	Chrysler Sales Increased 3.1% in February	The Chrysler Corporation reported today that domestic car and truck sales rose 3.1 percent in February, beating estimates, with a surge in truck sales offsetting a sharp drop in car sales. Over all, sales for Chrysler, the third-largest American auto maker, rose to 200,068 from 193,983 a year earlier. Car sales fell 9.1 percent, to 64,506, while truck sales increased 10 percent, to 135,563.
1998-02-01	Why Do People Quit Their Jobs? Because They Can	MIKE MITCHELL was perfectly happy last spring in his job as an employee communications specialist here for the Phelps Dodge Corporation. He liked his boss, had a lot of independence and felt challenged. He had just had his one-year review and it was positive. He received a raise.
1998-01-08	Camry Holds Off Accord For Title of Best-Selling Car	After a race to the wire, the Toyota Camry beat the Honda Accord for the title of the nation's best-selling car in 1997, leaving the Ford Taurus in third place and ending its five-year reign as the top seller. Strong sales in December for Toyota, Honda and the General Motors Corporation left the auto industry as a whole with better-than-expected sales for the year. Auto makers sold 15.2 million vehicles in the United States last year, up from 15.1 million vehicles sold in 1996.
1998-01-03	Camry and Accord Race for Sales Title	The biggest car race of the year was held on dealer lots in December. Who won? It's anyone's guess. With the last sales figures about to trickle in, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord were neck and neck, both vying for the title of the year's best-selling car. Ford's Taurus, a five-time champion, has been demoted to third place.
1997-12-25	Honda Predicts Output Will Rise 3.3% in 1998	The Honda Motor Company forecasts its global production will rise 3.3 percent next year as it starts building its popular Odyssey mini-van in Canada and shifts the production of its Acura luxury sedan to the United States. The company said yesterday that it would increase North American production capacity to more than one million vehicles by 2001 from 790,000 now. By next autumn, it will begin producing 120,000 mini-vans a year at its Canadian plant and will roll out its first Acuras built in the United States.
1997-12-05	Honda Is No. 2 in Japan	For the first time in its 49-year history, the Honda Motor Company can claim to be Japan's second-largest auto maker after the Toyota Motor Corporation. Last month, Honda overtook the Nissan Motor Company to sell more vehicles in Japan. Honda sold 74,706 autos in its domestic market in November, 4.3 percent more than Nissan's 71,593 units, according to figures released today.
1997-11-14	Honda, Beating Out G.M., Plans to Build Cars in China	Beating out a competing bid by the General Motors Corporation, the Honda Motor Company announced today that it had won the right to manufacture passenger cars at a plant in southern China. Honda executives said the venture, their first auto assembly operation in China's perplexing car market, would involve a $200 million investment with two local partners to produce a model resembling the Honda Accord. Honda will take a 50 percent stake.
1997-11-08	'Zero Emission' Car Still Fouls the Planet	To the Editor: ''Hybrid Effort by Honda to Curb Exhaust Pollution'' (Automobiles, Nov. 2) did a disservice to electric vehicles in reporting that Honda's new zero-level-emissions vehicle is supposed to have equivalent emissions to the plants generating power for electric vehicles. That comparison ignores substantial amounts of pollution that gasoline vehicles directly or indirectly emit: increases of tailpipe emissions over time, evaporation of fuel from the vehicle and from gasoline refining and delivery to the market.
1997-11-06	Texas and Arkansas emu ranchers sue Honda over a TV spot they say disparages their birds.	WHAT does it take to offend an emu? The American Honda Motor Company found out late last month when a group of Texas and Arkansas emu ranchers sued the auto company over a television commercial that they contend disparaged the ostrich-like birds.
1997-11-05	Auto Makers Report Weak October Sales	The Big Three American auto makers reported weak sales in October, giving the industry a slow start in the first month of the new model year. The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 4 percent last month compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, mostly because of weak sales of vans, small sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales dropped 2.1 percent last month, as a sharp drop in mini-van sales outweighed rising sales of large sport utility vehicles like the Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator. The Chrysler Corporation announced on Monday that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October.
1997-11-05	Auto Giants Build a Glut of Asian Plants, Just as Demand Falls	Shoppers have deserted car dealerships across Southeast Asia since the region's currency crisis began last summer, while investors who have lost fortunes in plummeting stock markets have flooded the used-car market with late-model luxury cars. The world's auto giants do not seem to care. Even though some industry experts insist they should pull back, General Motors and Ford Motor are busy building huge new assembly plants in Thailand and preparing to open up to five more factories in Southeast Asia and China. And Toyota and Honda are dealing with the crisis with temporary production cutbacks rather than changing their basic strategic plans.
1997-11-04	October Auto Sales Weak Except for Newest Designs	People shopping for a new car last month were ready to plunk down money for the hottest new or redesigned models, leaving auto makers with lackluster sales for all but the freshest designs. The Chrysler Corporation said today that its sales fell 8.3 percent in October, the first month of the new model year. But its newest sport utility vehicle, the brawny Dodge Durango, sold briskly, as did its new four-door version of the Dodge Ram pickup truck.
1997-10-16	Big, Bigger, Biggest: Rolling Reports From Across the Country; A Mini-Van With a Checkered Future	EVER SINCE their beloved Checker cabs began heading for the scrapheap, New Yorkers have grumbled about the lack of room in the rest of the city's taxis, which can turn rides into Big Apple moments of torture. That's starting to change now, as the Honda Odyssey, not a car at all but a bubble-ended mini-van, is making its presence felt. For Odyssey passengers, there is more legroom, more headroom and more storage space. There are even air-conditioning ducts in the back.
1997-10-10	Toyota Seizes a Title, but Ford's Trucks Stay in the Money	The 1997 model year is officially over, and there is a new name at the top of the list of the best-selling cars: the Toyota Camry. The Camry took the title from the Ford Taurus, which had been the top-selling car in America for the prior four years, having stolen the crown from the Honda Accord. But the race is already on for the 1998 model year, and Honda has its eyes on the prize again with a redesigned Accord that recently went on sale. This past year, even with an aging design, the Accord came close to knocking the Taurus down to third place, with Honda selling just 1,696 fewer Accords.
1997-10-04	Auto Sales Weaken as Buyers Await Deals	Call it the car buyer's revenge. Auto sales slowed in September, and as a result auto makers are expected to announce a new round of rebates and discounted lease deals as they vigorously try to woo more buyers into showrooms.
1997-10-02	Chrysler, After Sales Plunge, Is Hopeful on New Models	All year long, the Chrysler Corporation has watched its sales lag behind last year's record levels, and in September its disappointment deepened. So far this year, Chrysler sales were down 7.1 percent. The company said today that its sales dropped 14.1 percent last month, with car sales down 14.4 percent and sales of mini-vans, Jeeps and pickup trucks down a surprising 13.9 percent.
1997-10-02	Honda Files Lawsuit Against Republic	The Honda Motor Company's American unit said today that it had filed suit against Republic Industries to halt Republic's proposed acquisitions of Honda dealerships in Tennessee and Alabama in the latest of several similar actions against Republic. The American Honda Motor Company said the suit, which was filed in United States District Courts in Tennessee and Alabama, contended the company's dealer agreements and policy on public ownership of its dealers allow it to withhold its consent on Republic's proposed acquisitions. Republic, a highly acquisitive company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., owns new- and used-car chains, the National and Alamo car rental companies, and solid waste companies.
1997-10-01	Republic and Toyota Reach Settlement	Republic Industries reached a settlement with the Toyota Motor Corporation today that clears the way for Republic to quickly add Japanese car dealerships to its chain of new-car showrooms. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
1997-09-30	Republic Selling Security Unit To Ameritech for $610 Million	The Ameritech Corporation said today that it would buy the security business of Republic Industries for $610 million, giving Ameritech more residential customers and a wider reach for its fast-growing theft-protection unit. The purchase, which is subject to regulatory approval, would add 310,000 clients to Ameritech's 566,000 security customers, making Ameritech's Securitylink No. 2 behind ADT, the nation's largest security company, as it gains 35 markets in the Midwest and Southeast.
1997-09-21	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Acura Integra Type R; A New-Age Muscle Car With a Racing Pedigree	ACURA has always had two distinct personalities. Its big sedans, like the TL and RL Series, are practical, reliable and just a tad uninspiring. But the Integras -- especially the coupes -- are stylish runabouts that make up for their modest creature comforts with zippy performance. This year, the Honda subsidiary widened this schism with the Integra Type R, an austere, relatively cheap supercoupe with the suspension of a true sports car and a power plant that borrows heavily from Honda's racing technology.
1997-09-14	To Pick Up Buyers, Some New Lines	IN designing its 1998 Accord coupe, Honda's philosophy was to the point: A coupe should be more than a sedan that's missing two doors. The remake of the 1998 Accord line, which now consists of only a coupe and a sedan -- a station wagon is no longer available -- marks the first time the coupe and sedan are markedly different in design.
1997-09-14	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1998 Honda Accord; Ex-Champ Returns to Center Court	THE high-stakes market for midsize sedans is not unlike an intensely competitive tennis tournament. Every year, a new model charges onto the court, driving a forceful serve that challenges its opponents to return it.
1997-09-04	Sales Results Show Americans Buying Trucks and More Trucks	The new Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle has not yet reached showrooms, but most dealerships are sold out for the rest of this year. The Lincoln Navigator, a huge luxury truck, is also in short supply. And August sales results released today show that Americans continue to buy more and more trucks, with the latest, expensive truck models among the most popular. The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales rose a stronger-than-expected 7.6 percent last month compared with the period a year earlier. Trucks did well, with sales up 7.2 percent, propelled by strong mini-van sales, but car sales were also strong, rising 7.8 percent.
1997-08-30	Buick Bringing Its Rivals to the Showroom Floor	It sounds like a cruel challenge: Why not put Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords in Buick dealerships and see whether dealers can persuade people to buy the Buicks anyway? Even executives at Buick's parent company, the General Motors Corporation, thought the idea was a joke at first. After all, Camrys and Accords are synonymous with high quality and reliability to the generation of buyers who normally would not be caught dead in a Buick showroom. To baby boomers, Buicks are synonymous with mushy steering, velour-covered bench seats and room for six.
1997-08-26	Republic Reaches a Preliminary Pact With Toyota on Dealerships	It is one down and one to go for H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries, the nation's largest car dealership owner. Republic, which has been feuding in the courts with the United States arm of the Toyota Motor Company and with the American Honda Motor Company, reached a preliminary agreement late yesterday with Toyota that would allow Republic to buy more Toyota dealerships and would end litigation between the two sides. The deal with Toyota came after more than six hours of meetings in Dallas between the two sides. dr
1997-08-22	Fight Over Car Dealerships Takes a Turn for the Nasty	Dishing dirt has turned into throwing mud in the very public spat between the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company on the one hand and H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries on the other. In the latest round, Republic staged a news conference yesterday in New York at which 23 former state attorneys general it had hired concurred that Toyota and Honda had no right to block Republic's attempts to buy car dealerships.
1997-08-13	Huizenga, Toyota and the Perils of Lawsuits	A vicious legal fight between H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries and two Japanese auto makers is proving that few problems can be as deadly to a stock as the uncertainty created by big lawsuits. Republic's stock closed today at $23.4375, having lost nearly half its value since reaching a high of $42.75 on Jan. 23. This precipitous drop in a rising market is particularly serious for Republic, which has an expansion strategy of using its stock to buy up other businesses.
1997-08-02	Auto Makers In Price War To Spur Sales	Sales results released by auto makers today showed an industry in an old-fashioned price war, with companies offering some of their broadest discounts ever in efforts to increase their market shares. For the 11 auto makers reporting results today, sales rose a combined 5.6 percent last month over July 1996. The General Motors Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Company all reported sales gains in July, while the Chrysler Corporation said its sales dropped 9 percent from record levels in July 1996. G.M. said its stronger sales were propelled by rebates it began offering in mid-July, while Honda and Toyota have been passing on savings from the weak yen.
1997-07-27	Midsize, Yes, but They're Growing All the Time	The medium-sized cars aimed at Middle America keep getting bigger. Consider, for example, the 1998 Honda Accord that goes on sale in September. Although Honda has not released specifications, the redesigned car is expected to be longer and wider, with a longer wheelbase. A bigger cabin will push the sixth-generation Accord from the compact to the midsize class, as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency, with as much interior space as a Ford Taurus. The Accord will be more powerful, with an available 3-liter, 200-horsepower V6 borrowed from the Acura 3.0CL. But the big news is that the base engine, a 2.3-liter four-cylinder, will be the first low-emission power plant available nationwide. It produces 150 horsepower, up 15 percent from 1997.
1997-07-20	Testing 2 Rivals, High and Low	HARLEY-DAVIDSON'S least expensive cruiser bike is the 1,340-cubic-centimeter Dyna Glide Lowrider, priced at $14,000. Prices of Harley cruisers go up from there to $16,000, and touring bikes can top $18,000. To see how close the Japanese are coming to the American paradigm, I test-rode two Japanese cruisers, one from the entry-level end of the price scale, the Honda Shadow ACE, and one that is bigger, heavier and more mechanically complex than a Harley, the Yamaha Royal Star.
1997-07-20	When You Are What You Ride	RIDERS of Harley-Davidsons include blacks, whites, Orientals and most other categorizations on the census form. They may be high school dropouts or Ph.D.'s, con artists or matinee idols, ex-convicts or investment bankers. But whatever their backgrounds or bank accounts, they tend to dress, ride and act much alike. Harleyism is a set of motorcycle mores that separates riders of Harley-Davidsons from all others. The rules have evolved over decades as Harley riders have closed ranks against those on Japanese bikes -- known as ''rice burners'' among the faithful.
1997-07-06	Piece by Piece, Honda Wins the Hearts of Car Thieves	THE Honda Accord may be, as its advertising has suggested, ''the car that sells itself,'' but its desirability doesn't end when it leaves the dealership. The most popular car last year in retail sales -- Ford's Taurus was No. 1 if fleet purchases are added -- the Accord also tops the lists of cars likely to be stolen. Indeed, the 1994 Accord was the most-stolen car last year in New York City and nationwide.
1997-07-03	G.M. June Sales Off 13.3% Amid Industrywide Decline	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 13.3 percent last month, leaving the auto industry as a whole on track to end the second quarter with a whimper, following a stellar first quarter. The weak G.M. sales reflect lackluster demand for new cars and trucks industrywide, Wall Street analysts said. Sales of the company's pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles fell 7.7 percent, while car sales plummeted 16.7 percent in June, compared with a year earlier.
1997-07-02	Chrysler Sales Were Off 4% in June, Less, Though, Than Expected	The Chrysler Corporation reported a 4 percent sales drop for June today, its fifth straight monthly decline, but demand for its pickup trucks and mini-vans was so strong that the overall decline was less than Wall Street analysts had feared. Compared with June 1996, Chrysler's car sales dropped 14.8 percent last month, while sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and Jeeps rose 2.5 percent, setting a monthly record. So far, June looks to be a slow month for auto sales generally. Toyota reported a 2.3 percent drop in sales today compared with a year earlier, though Honda sales rose 8.9 percent and Nissan was up 2.4 percent. Most smaller manufacturers fared poorly. Total sales for the 12 producers reporting today were down 2.3 percent.
1997-06-29	If You Can't Beat Dilbert, Hire Him	THE chief executive of a national company going into its fifth reorganization was at the lectern, addressing a few thousand apprehensive employees about the need for trust. As a collective groan rippled through the audience, a small figure popped out from behind the executive.
1997-06-21	Camry Teaches Economics 101: Features Are Nice but Price Sells	Auto advertisers love to promote each new model as changing an industry, but only a few actually do so, like the 1986 Ford Taurus, which spawned a fleet of aerodynamic imitators. Introduced last autumn, the 1997 Toyota Camry lacks the grace or beauty to alter automotive design -- indeed, its bland curves verge on the utilitarian. But the car is reshaping the nation's midsize car market because of its price tag of $16,448 to $24,088, down $550 to $1,745 from the 1996 model, depending on the version. The lower prices have narrowed substantially, without eliminating, the premium that American buyers have come to pay for a Japanese car compared with a similarly equipped American model.
1997-06-04	G.M. Posts Decline in Sales; Mixed Results by Japanese	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales fell 8.5 percent last month compared with May 1996, the second big American auto maker to post a sales decline for the month. Sales were mixed for large Japanese auto makers, which have been enjoying the benefits of a strong dollar. Toyota said today that its sales fell 6 percent compared with the period a year ago, while Honda reported that its sales rose 4.8 percent. Nissan said its sales rose 7.8 percent and Mazda said its sales fell 15.1 percent, and some other auto makers posted mixed May results today. For the 17 auto makers who have reported May results so far, sales are down 7.2 percent, with car sales down 11.7 percent and sales of mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks up 0.2 percent.
1997-05-21	Profit Surge In Quarter For Honda	The Honda Motor Company said today that its profits more than doubled in the latest quarter, capping a record year as the auto maker reaped the rewards from a broad revamping of its product line. Since late 1994 Honda, which once made only passenger cars, has introduced a series of sport utility vehicles and mini-vans that have galvanized sales in its home market and have proved popular abroad as well. As with other Japanese exporters, Honda's results in the last quarter and last year were also bolstered by the substantial weakening of the Japanese yen against other currencies.
1997-05-08	HONDA SUES TO THWART REPUBLIC DEALERSHIP PLANS	The Honda Motor Company said today that it had sued Republic Industries to block Republic's acquisitions of Honda and Acura dealerships in major markets. The Japanese auto maker's United States sales unit, the American Honda Motor Company, said it believed Republic wanted to buy more than 60 Honda and Acura franchises in major markets in the next 18 months, which would give it as much as 20 percent of American Honda's total sales volume. American Honda said Republic refused to recognize dealer pacts and ownership policies that limit the number of dealerships any one person or company may own. American Honda's dealer network includes 1,000 Honda dealerships and 270 Acura dealerships. Acura is Honda's luxury car line.
1997-05-02	General Motors gambles on a do-or-die strategy to reinvigorate the Oldsmobile marque.	EVERYONE agrees it is a tough assignment. The Leo Burnett Company is charged with wooing Honda and Toyota buyers to Oldsmobile, best known for building stodgy sedans driven by grandparents.
1997-05-02	Sales for G.M. And Chrysler Fell in April	The General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation said today that their car and truck sales cooled off last month, even as Japanese auto makers, benefiting from favorable exchange rates, reported stronger sales. G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, said that its sales in the United States dropped 5.2 percent last month from the corresponding period a year earlier, while Chrysler said its sales fell 11.5 percent. By contrast, the eight Japanese auto makers reporting April sales today saw their sales rise a combined 2.0 percent.
1997-04-19	Honda to Raise Exports to U.S.	The Honda Motor Company plans to increase its United States-bound auto exports from Japan by roughly one-third this year to meet strong demand for some of its models. An executive vice president, Yoshihide Munekuni, said the company would ship about 200,000 vehicles across the Pacific, up from 152,000 in 1996.
1997-04-02	Chrysler Reports Flat Sales In Key Light-Truck Market	The Chrysler Corporation, which rode demand for its rugged Jeeps and roomy mini-vans to near-record profits last year, said today that its sales of the high-profit vehicles had leveled off. Sales of Chrysler's sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks fell two-tenths of 1 percent last month from the comparable period a year ago. Even the recently redesigned Jeep Cherokee saw its sales drop 19 percent in March. Chrysler's car sales fell 8.7 percent, and the company's overall sales fell 3.4 percent.
1997-03-21	Banc One uses promotional tie-ins to a movie about Selena to reach out to the Hispanic market.	A BANKING powerhouse is proclaiming ''Hooray for Hollywood'' with a Spanish accent. The Banc One Corporation, the country's 10th-largest bank, has become the financial services sponsor of ''Selena,'' a biographical film about Selena Quintanilla Perez, the South Texan singer who died in March 1995. Banc One is spending more than $1 million on a series of extensive marketing tie-ins with the movie, which is being released nationally today by the Warner Brothers unit of Time Warner Inc.
1997-02-22	Profits at Honda Tripled in Third Quarter	The Honda Motor Company said today that its earnings more than tripled in the fiscal third quarter, putting it on track for the most profitable year in its 49-year history. After being left behind when the popularity of mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and other light trucks began to grow rapidly in Japan, Honda caught up and has been faring well in those markets for the last two years.
1997-02-04	January Car Sales Up 2.3%; Foreign Makers Have Surge	Foreign auto makers showed the biggest sales gains in the American auto market last month as the strong dollar continued to help them offer generous lease deals and low prices. Among the nine auto makers reporting January results today, sales rose 2.3 percent from a year ago. Foreign auto makers reporting results today saw their combined sales rise 10.9 percent, while the combined sales of the two American auto makers reporting results today dropped a tenth of 1 percent.
1996-12-29	Reborn, Audi Joins A German Renaissance	PEOPLE who drive a lot of new cars may disagree about the merits of a particular model -- or about the future of the automobile, for that matter. But they are nearly unanimous on this: The new vehicles sold in America have never been better. While critics of the auto industry argue that much more progress can be made on safety, durability and fuel efficiency -- and even that the internal-combustion engine should be retired -- there is little doubt that today's cars are far superior in all respects to their predecessors of just a decade ago. Fresh designs use space more effectively. Computer controls make engines start easier and run smoother. Electronic transmissions shift gears for optimum power and economy. Air bags, side-impact beams and ''crumple zones'' -- not to mention antilock brakes and traction controls -- have helped to reduce fatalities and serious injuries. More thought goes into the controls and more care goes into the way the pieces are assembled.
1996-12-29	A Preference for Sport Over the Sport Utility	PEOPLE who drive a lot of new cars may disagree about the merits of a particular model -- or about the future of the automobile, for that matter. But they are nearly unanimous on this: The new vehicles sold in America have never been better. While critics of the auto industry argue that much more progress can be made on safety, durability and fuel efficiency -- and even that the internal-combustion engine should be retired -- there is little doubt that today's cars are far superior in all respects to their predecessors of just a decade ago.

1996-12-06	Car Companies In United States Hurt by Imports	Japanese and European auto makers have come roaring back in the United States this autumn, by cutting prices and increasing rebates. After several years of gradually winning back buyers, American auto makers, particularly General Motors, are facing their toughest competition since the early 1990's.
1996-12-06	A Show of Support for Hendrick	The reaction of the Nascar community yesterday to the indictment on Wednesday of Rick Hendrick, one of the sport's leading car owners, was divided into three parts: support for Hendrick's record and character as an owner; refusal to comment on the substance of the charges against him, since they have nothing to do with racing, and a feeling that the timing of the announcement was unfair to Hendrick and Terry Labonte, his championship-winning driver. Hendrick, Labonte and just about everyone else of any importance in the Winston Cup Series are in Manhattan this weekend for the annual awards dinner tonight, where Labonte will pick up $1.5 million for winning the 1996 Winston Cup.
1996-12-05	Ford Reports Vehicle Sales Dropped 2.2% in November	The Ford Motor Company reported today that its sales fell 2.2 percent in November, as the final tally of monthly auto sales showed that American companies had lost ground to Japanese and European competitors. The Big Three American auto makers built 72.1 percent of the cars and trucks sold in the United States in November, down sharply -- three percentage points -- from the levels during November 1995. Foreign auto makers, especially Honda and Toyota, gained market share given up by American companies, particularly the General Motors Corporation. G.M.'s market share dipped below 30 percent for the third month this year, analysts said.
1996-11-21	F.T.C. Said to Reach Agreement On Improper Auto Lease Ads	The Federal Trade Commission is planning to announce on Thursday that it has reached an agreement with five auto makers accused of improperly advertising auto lease deals, according to people familiar with the agreement. The companies involved are the General Motors Corporation, Honda Motor, Mazda Motor, Isuzu Motor and Mitsubishi Motor , said people with a detailed knowledge of the matter who insisted on anonymity.
1996-11-17	When One Good Turn Deserves Another	THE sky is blue, the few remaining leaves are brown and the passenger is quickly turning green. The car I am enthusiastically driving is emphatically red, a 1997 Honda Prelude Type SH, and I have spent the afternoon flinging it around every curve and corner in a swath of the northern Catskills, trying to determine if it is possible to flap this seemingly unflappable sports coupe.
1996-11-16	Honda Net Gains Almost 300% In Half-Year as U.S. Sales Surge	The Honda Motor Company said today that its earnings soared almost 300 percent in the fiscal first half of the year as sales, particularly in the United States, rose strongly. Another Japanese auto maker, the Mazda Motor Corporation, also had improved results, despite falling sales. It posted a first-half profit for the first time in four years.
1996-11-12	Ford Joins Move to Used Car Warranties as New Rivals Grow	The Ford Motor Company today became the latest auto maker to offer a warranty program for used cars from its dealers, with the first ''quality certified'' used Fords to be sold next week from some dealerships in the Southeast. The program is expected to be available at dealers nationwide next spring. Guy M. Bertram, Ford's regional marketing manager, said he expected that 250,000 to 300,000 used Fords annually would be sold under the warranty program. An additional 20,000 low-mileage Lincoln used cars will be sold each year under a separate warranty program.

1996-11-02	G.M. Car Sales Drop as Other Makers Report Increases	The General Motors Corporation reported today that its car and truck sales dropped 7.9 percent last month from a year earlier, even as Chrysler, Honda and Toyota all announced their highest October sales ever. Wall Street analysts said that it was hard to figure out why G.M.'s sales were weak. G.M. had strong car sales in October 1995; still, the 24 percent drop in car sales, to 215,276, was larger than expected. G.M.'s sales of pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles rose 22.1 percent, to 182,661, but analysts said the gain compared with weak sales last year, when a trucking company strike slowed deliveries of these light trucks.
1996-10-27	Indeed, Less Is More	I CAN'T see it. After test-driving two versions of the redesigned 1997 Toyota Camry, I still can't tell how the midsize family sedan was ''de-contented,'' the auto industry's clunky term for reducing the cost of manufacturing a car. When Toyota began to develop the fourth-generation Camry, Japanese auto makers' profits were being squeezed by the strength of the yen against other currencies, which made it hard for them to sell their cars abroad. So the company ordered its designers and engineers to make the new version of its best seller profitable even if the yen stayed at near-record highs. Much of the task was accomplished by reducing the number of parts, which in turn requires less assembly time. For example, the front bumper has seven fewer parts than the bumper of the '96 model, yet it is able to withstand a 5-mile-an-hour impact, unlike the bumper of the '96.
1996-10-16	After an underdog agency gets the Acura account, heads turn on Madison Avenue.	The shock waves from the stunning conclusion to the review of the Acura account, with billings estimated at $125 million, continue to reverberate along Madison Avenue. Acura, the luxury vehicle division of the American Honda Motor Company, yesterday announced the dismissal of its longtime agency, Fathom in Los Angeles, and the hiring of the darkest of the dark horse contenders in the review, Suissa Miller in Santa Monica, Calif.
1996-10-15	Small Agency Is Said to Win Acura Review	Acura, the luxury division of the American Honda Motor Company, has ended one of the biggest and most closely watched advertising reviews of the year, according to executives with knowledge of the decision, by dismissing the agency that had handled the brand since its introduction and awarding the account, with billings estimated at $125 million, to a dark horse finalist. The executives, who spoke last night on the condition of anonymity, said that American Honda had dismissed the Los Angeles office of Ketchum Advertising, which had been reorganized -- and renamed Fathom -- in an effort to retain the account. That office, part of the Ketchum Communications unit of the Omnicom Group, had created campaigns for Acura since the brand was introduced in 1984.
1996-09-05	G.M. Says Its Vehicle Sales Slipped 7.9% in August	The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales last month dropped 7.9 percent from the strong levels of a year ago, partly because of weak demand for large sedans and luxury cars, and partly because dealers did not have an adequate supply of trucks to sell. Sales of G.M. cars plunged 13.8 percent in August, while sales of the company's mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose a slight 2.1 percent. Of G.M.'s eight divisions, only Chevrolet and Saab, the car maker it owns jointly with Investor A.B., reported higher sales.
1996-08-02	G.M. Sales Decline, but Chrysler's Surge	The General Motors Corporation's sales fell by 2.3 percent in July from a year earlier while the Chrysler Corporation's sales surged 18.8 percent, as overall demand for vehicles appeared to cool and shift toward mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks instead of cars. Nearly three-fifths of G.M.'s vehicle sales in the United States come from cars, while two-thirds of Chrysler's sales come from light trucks, which the industry defines as including mini-vans and sport vehicles. So the shift toward light trucks has particularly benefited Chrysler.
1996-07-30	Finalists Named In Acura Review	The Acura division of the American Honda Motor Company yesterday named four finalists to compete for its account, with billings estimated at $125 million, in a review that began in May. Eric Conn, senior manager for automobile advertising at American Honda in Torrance, Calif., identified the finalists as: Fathom, formerly the Ketchum Advertising Los Angeles unit of Ketchum Communications, a unit of the Omnicom Group that has handled the account for almost 12 years; Deutsch Inc. in New York and Santa Monica, Calif.; Rubin Postaer & Associates in Santa Monica, the agency for the Honda line of vehicles marketed by American Honda, and Suissa Miller Advertising in Santa Monica. A decision is expected in October, Mr. Conn said.
1996-07-30	Honda to Import Civics Into U.S.	The Honda Motor Company said today that it would import Japanese-built Civic sedans into the United States for the first time in a year because of strong demand for the small cars. Honda makes Civics for the North American market in East Liberty, Ohio, and Alliston, Ontario.
1996-06-16	BEHIND THE WHEEL/1997 Acura 2.2 CL;Luxury That's Priced to Please	I WAS sailing along at somewhat extra-legal speed when the two guys hove up next to me in a Chevy Blazer and called across lanes to inquire about the car's price, among other things. That was in Pennsylvania, but the same sort of thing happened in gridlocked lower Manhattan. And on Long Island. Acura's new 2.2 CL sports coupe just begs for attention.
1996-06-06	4 Doors and Air, but No Heat	"Though the Honda Motor Company's new City subcompact is priced to fit the pocketbooks of Asia's emerging middle class, is designed to withstand the pounding of Asia's muddy roads and is being assembled in Thailand, the company refuses to call it an ""Asia car."" Engineers who utter the forbidden words have to contribute money to the office coffee pool. Why is Honda being so coy? Simple: it does not want buyers in the world's fastest-growing car market to think they are being short-changed with a stripped-down version of the Civic or other cars that Honda sells to more affluent customers at home and in the West."
1996-05-22	Honda Group Yearly Pretax Profit Up 22%	The Honda Motor Company said today that group pretax profit rose 22 percent in the latest fiscal year, aided by increased sales of recreational vehicles in Japan and motorcycles in Asia. Honda, whose 1995 sales in Japan ranked it fifth among auto manufacturers, is increasing its share of Japan's fast-growing market for recreational vehicles. The company did not introduce its own models until late 1994, but it has quickly carved out a niche with the introduction of the Odyssey mini-van and the CR-V, a sport utility vehicle.
1996-05-17	Honda to Expand in U.S.	The Honda Motor Company said today that it and its suppliers would spend $300 million and create 1,200 jobs at plants in Ohio and Michigan, part of a plan to increase Honda's United States engine and transmission production. Honda said it would increase United States production of automatic transmissions to 650,000 units beginning in 1997.
1996-05-14	Acura Account Put In Review by Honda	The American Honda Motor Company said yesterday that it had placed in review the account of its Acura luxury car division, which has been handled for almost 12 years by the Los Angeles office of Ketchum Advertising. Though billings were not disclosed, trade publications estimated them at $120 million to $125 million. The review is the first in the United States by one of the three big Japanese auto makers -- Toyota, Nissan and Honda -- since 1987, when Nissan assigned its account to what is now the TBWA Chiat/Day unit of the Omnicom Group in Venice, Calif.
1996-05-10	Ford Chiefs Say the Taurus Can't Stay No. 1 at Any Cost	The Ford Motor Company will not risk missing its profit targets simply to insure that its Taurus is the nation's best-selling car again this year, a top Ford official said today. Partly because of heavy advertising and generous rebates, the Taurus has held that position for the last four years. But the Honda Accord narrowly outsold the Taurus during the first four months of this year, 124,927 to 123,837, a pattern that Ford's critics have attributed to the company's decision to redesign the Taurus and to raise the price when the new model was introduced last fall.
1996-05-04	Detroit's Sales Pace Slowed in April, With Ford Off 2%	In the auto business, April was a lamb to March's lion. Car and truck sales last month dropped to an annual pace of 14.6 million, seasonally adjusted, down from a sizzling 15.9 million in March. The April slowdown reflected surprisingly weak sales at the Ford Motor Company along with shortages of some General Motors autos, which were slow getting to dealers because of a 17-day strike in March.
1996-05-03	A More Varied Diet for a Cab-Hungry City	"Two vehicle models were approved yesterday for use as New York City taxis, prompting a prediction that in a few years the cabs cruising the streets will look a lot different, except for the color. The Honda Odyssey, a minivan, and the Ford Explorer, a sport utility vehicle, which both had been used experimentally since last fall, have performed beautifully during a brutal winter and a pothole-plagued spring and ""have earned the right to be added to the menu of vehicles available for use as taxicabs,"" Christopher R. Lynn, chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, announced."
1996-05-02	Strong Auto Sales Point to Rising Confidence	Despite rising gasoline prices, two of the biggest auto makers reported strong April sales today that exceeded analysts' expectations, providing another sign that consumers' confidence is growing. The General Motors Corporation said its sales rose 7.7 percent last month, compared with April 1995, despite a recent strike that crimped the production of some of its hottest sellers.
1996-04-21	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Acura 3.5RL;Impersonating a Lexus: Exhibit A	I STOOD in the vegetable aisle of the supermarket, comparing a can of Green Giant Niblets with a can of the store-brand corn. The generic variety cost 39 cents, the Green Giant 73 cents. Assuming the quality is virtually the same, why the big difference in price? Acura executives may have asked a similar question when they developed the 1996 3.5RL, the Honda division's new flagship sedan, which replaces the Legend. Why should one Japanese luxury car cost so much more than another, and might there be a market for a lower-priced imitator?
1996-04-21	Once More Without the Vigor: Acura Plays the Numbers Game	"A decade after revolutionizing the luxury care market, the Acura division of the American Honda Motor Company is reinventing itself, revamping its product line and plugging vehicles into nearly every conceivable niche. It is also renaming its models with letter-number combinations that represent the type of vehicle and the engine size. Acura says it research indicates that affluent customers associate luxury with numbers, not word. Rich Thomas, executive vice president and general manager, boasted in an interview that ""we now have a full line of vehicles with no holes."" He added, ""The broadening of the product line will allow a buyer to stay within the Acrua family no matter what kind of vehicle he or she desire.*"
1996-04-16	FORD SWEETENS TAURUS DEAL TO FIGHT CHALLENGE	"Moving to protect the Taurus's title as the ""best-selling car in America"" from a challenge by the Honda Accord, the Ford Motor Company sweetened financing terms yesterday for the vehicle. Ford cut the financing costs for the Taurus and the Contour, offering loans with an interest rate of 2.9 percent instead of 4.8 percent. The average lease payment on a Taurus will drop to about $240 a month from about $270. The Taurus, which has held the top United States sales position for the last three years, has had sales of 91,828 cars this year -- just 486 more than the Accord. Ford also said it was introducing a new base model for its redesigned Escort, which goes on sale May 23. The new model will start at $11,430, about $500 less than the old base model."
1996-04-14	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Eagle Vision TSi, Honda Civic HX;Testing a Shifty Character And a Shiftless Wonder	AUTOMOBILE transmissions come in two flavors, manual or automatic. Check that: they used to come in just two flavors. Now Honda and Chrysler, seeking to add pizazz to some plain-vanilla products, are offering exotic variations. Each works splendidly. Start with the continuously variable transmission, available as an option (for about $1,000) on the Honda Civic HX coupe, which was redesigned for 1996.
1996-04-09	Honda to Offer An Electric Car	The Honda Motor Company said yesterday that it would introduce a two-seat electric car in California in the spring of 1997. The declaration makes Honda the second auto maker with plans to offer a specially made electric car. The General Motors Corporation plans to begin selling and leasing its EV-1 model in Arizona and California this fall.
1996-03-31	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mercury Sable vs. Accord and Camry;Circling the Wagons	IF the top brass of the Ford Motor Company kept rejecting sketches of a new Ford Taurus in favor of something bold and different, they certainly got what they wanted. But did they kill the golden goose in the process of coaxing out the latest egg? There are many who think that when it comes to the Taurus -- and its fraternal twin, the Mercury Sable -- bold and different spell ugly. Initially, I tended to agree, but I confess that the designs are growing on me, especially the wagon versions. At the risk of coming off as a fuddy-duddy, the wagon seems to have a more coherent appearance than the sedan, which looks to me as if the styling wizards concentrated so much on making the front end look like a trout that they ran out of time, money and good ideas for the rear.
1996-03-21	Acura Dealers Group Selects Landey	The Tri-State Acura Dealers Advertising Association said yesterday that it had selected Landey & Partners, Grounds Morris in New York to handle its account, with billings estimated at $4 million to $6 million. The Acura division of the American Honda Motor Company recently permitted local dealer associations to hire agencies separate from the national Acura agency, the Ketchum Advertising Los Angeles unit of Ketchum Communications. The review began with Landey and three other New York agencies -- Christy MacDougall Mitchell, the Cox Group and Korey Kay & Partners -- and was narrowed earlier this month to Christy MacDougall and Landey. Two additional agencies then joined the review, Scaros & Casselman in Stamford, Conn., and Slater Hanft Martin in New York; Landey was chosen yesterday from that second field of four, said Robert Certilman, president of Smithtown Acura on Long Island.
1996-03-06	Auto Sales Rise by 5.6%, With Ford's Flat in Month	Auto sales rose 5.6 percent last month, assuaging industry and Wall Street fears that the industry was heading for a stiff downturn. The Ford Motor Company reported nearly flat February sales today. Ford said its car sales fell 4.7 percent while its truck sales -- buoyed by its redesigned F-150 pickup -- rose 5.5 percent. Over all, Ford sales slipped one-tenth of 1 percent last month. Sales of the Ford Taurus and its sibling, the Mercury Sable, fell 3 percent despite $600 rebates. But Ford was encouraged because the slip came as Ford reduced sales of the two cars to fleets by 26 percent, while retail sales of the cars rose 45 percent in February, said Joel H. Pitcoff, Ford's market analysis manager.
1996-03-04	Acura Dealers Conduct Reviews	Acura dealer groups in metropolitan New York and Philadelphia are proceeding with reviews for their accounts after the Acura division of the American Honda Motor Corporation permitted local dealer associations to hire agencies separate from the national Acura agency, the Ketchum Advertising Los Angeles unit of Ketchum Communications. Robert Certilman, president of Smithtown Acura on Long Island, said that of four New York agencies initially considered for the metropolitan New York account, with billings estimated at $4 million to $6 million, two would proceed in the review: Christy MacDougall Mitchell and Landey & Partners, Grounds Morris. The two shops eliminated, he said, were the Cox Group and Korey Kay & Partners. Mr. Certilman said two more agencies would join the review, adding that a decision was expected by the end of March.
1996-02-23	Quarterly Profits Up For Honda Motor	Riding a strong rebound in domestic sales, the Honda Motor Company, the Japanese auto maker, said yesterday that its profit jumped 41 percent in its third quarter. Honda earned 18.4 billion yen, or $175 million, in the three months that ended on Dec. 31, up from 13 billion yen for the corresponding period in 1994. Sales jumped 13 percent, to 1.02 trillion yen, or $9.7 billion, from 905 billion yen a year earlier. Honda said rising Japanese sales and continued cost-cutting helped operating income even as its research and development and selling expenses rose. Honda said its automobile, motorcycle and other businesses all showed favorable results. It cited particularly strong domestic auto sales. (AP)
1996-02-17	Auto Ruling Favors Independent Traders	The European Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that independent traders might sell cars across the European Union.

1996-01-31	Dentsu Is Hired For Acura Project	The American unit of Honda Motor has hired Dentsu Inc. in Los Angeles to handle a small national research and marketing project for its Acura NSX luxury sports car. The billings were not disclosed. Eric Conn, senior manager for national advertising at American Honda in Torrance, Calif., confirmed a report of the assignment this week in Adweek. He said that Dentsu, which handles advertising in Japan for Honda as well as for Mazda and Toyota, was awarded its initial United States assignment after discussions between Dentsu and Honda executives in Japan.
1996-01-21	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Acura SLX;Something Borrowed, Something New	AMERICANS have a thing about trucks. Not just any trucks: the new breed of tough-looking, all-purpose haulers that handle like cars and offer comparable creature comforts. Hence the runaway popularity of fancy sport utility vehicles and the stampede to put rugged, off-road-capable transportation with pleasing highway manners into every auto showroom. Among the latest to arrive is the five-passenger, five-door Acura SLX, built to carry groceries through the slush of Boston as well as it hauls camping gear across the scrabble of Baja.
1996-01-07	Building All-American Vehicles in the U.S.	"Having failed to beat the United States auto industry, German and Japanese car makers have clearly decided to join it, as was made evident by several new vehicles on display here last week at the North American International Auto Show. Amid a growing number of made-in-America models bearing foreign names and enough new sport-utility vehicles to cause gridlock on a mountain trail, Mercedes-Benz served notice that it would participate in both trends, showing a thinly veiled prototype of its ""all activity vehicle,"" to be assembled at a new plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The rakish Mercedes will combine full-time all-wheel drive with carlike characteristics, including dual air bags in front and side-impact air bags in the doors. The Mercedes, to be sold starting in the fall of 1997 at a base price in the mid-$30,000's, is poised to compete with top-of-the-line sport-utilities like the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, as well as with the much more expensive Range Rover."
1995-12-20	Honda to Lift Capacity at Canadian Plant	The Honda Motor Company said today that it planned to double the capacity of its vehicle assembly plant in Alliston, Ontario, to begin production of a new mini-van in the fall of 1998. Honda said it would invest $210 million to add capacity to build as many as 120,000 mini-vans a year. The Alliston plant is currently capable of building as many as 120,000 Honda Civic subcompacts a year. The expansion will add 1,200 workers, bringing total employment to 3,000, Honda said.
1995-12-09	Honda May Expand	The stock of the Honda Motor Company surged yesterday to its highest level in more than six years on news the car maker may build a new North American factory to assemble mini-vans. Analysts said the factory, which is likely to be in Canada, would help Honda seize a bigger share of the growing market for light trucks and vans. On Japanese exchanges, Honda's shares rose as much as 150 yen, to 2,060 yen, the highest since Aug. 24, 1989. The stock closed up 60 yen, at 1,970. The American depository receipts were up $1.25, to $39.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. (Bloomberg Business News)
1995-12-08	Brazil Plant for Honda	The Honda Motor Company announced yesterday that it planned to build a $100 million factory in Brazil to make Honda Civics starting in August 1997. The Japanese auto maker said that the plant would be able to build 15,000 cars at first, rising to 30,000 by 1999 and capacity might eventually rise to 100,000 units. (AP)
1995-11-18	Honda Profits Fell 36% in Fiscal First Half	The Honda Motor Company said yesterday that its profits had declined by 36 percent in the first half of its fiscal year, but predicted it would show a slight improvement in earnings for the full year. Honda posted profits of 24.2 billion yen ($239 million) for the six months that ended on Sept. 30. Excluding last year's gain of 12.8 billion yen ($126 million) from the sale of its holding in Rover P.L.C., the decline was only 4 percent, Honda said. Honda said a weaker yen and strong domestic demand for its recreational vehicles might mean better profits than it had originally forecast for the year. The company, which posted earnings for last year of 61.53 billion yen ($609 million), raised its full-year group net profit forecast to 65 billion yen. Reuters

1995-10-31	Honda to Make Civics Overseas	The Honda Motor Company said today that it had stopped exporting Civic passenger cars to the United States last month and would shift production of the model to American factories in an effort to reduce the effect of the strong yen. Honda said it planned to increase production to 720,000 from 610,000 by 1997, at plants in East Liberty, Ohio, and Alliston, Ontario, as part of the plan for North America it introduced in July 1994.

1995-08-30	Honda Meets Emission Rule Set for 1997 in California	The Honda Motor Company said today that its new Civic subcompact model met strict emissions requirements set by California for 1997, making it the first gasoline-powered mass-production car to do so. But also today, California announced it had taken a step that could lead to a delay or softening of its toughest emissions standard, requiring 2 percent of all new vehicles to emit no pollution from their tailpipes by 1998. Most auto makers reluctantly plan to meet that standard with electric vehicles.

1995-08-24	Honda's Operating Net Rises 1.5% on Large Odyssey Sales	The Honda Motor Company said today that group net income tumbled 49 percent in the fiscal first quarter because year-earlier results were inflated by a one-time gain, but that operating earnings rose 1.5 percent, aided by strong sales of Odyssey utility vehicles in Japan. Net income fell to 11.92 billion yen, or $123 million at current exchange rates, in the quarter ended June 30 from 23.14 billion yen a year earlier. Profit in the 1994 quarter included an extraordinary gain from the sale of Honda's 20 percent holding in Rover Group Ltd. of Britain. Without that gain, net income in the 1995 quarter would have risen 16 percent, the company said.

But the four-wheeled fantasies of the world also call for something more. They require time. When you drive such a beastie, there is no short stop for gas, no drop-it-and-run at the parking garage. Whatever the destination, you have to allot time to talk about The Car.
1995-07-09	For Those With the Itch to Shift	"AUTOMATIC transmissions are easy. Move the gear selector into ""drive"" and the transmission shifts its own gears -- a fine formula for everyday commuting. But when a driver wants more control over the car's performance -- when driving fast, for instance, on a winding road -- an automatic makes a less than perfect partner because the driver surrenders control of the shifting to the transmission, which cannot read his or her mind. Several auto makers are working to change this by adding a new level of driver control to automatic transmissions. Acura, BMW and Porsche all offer vehicles equipped with such ""auto-manual"" transmissions, and Eagle will join them this fall. Although each version has a different name, all function in much the same way. In each, the transmission can operate as a normal automatic when the shift lever is in drive. Or the driver, by moving the shifter to a special position, can override the automatic's shifting pattern and select the gears. These are not simply clutchless manual transmissions -- like Volkswagen's ""Automatic Stick Shift"" of 1968-75 and various offerings in the 1940's and 50's -- but are sophisticated automatics capable of mimicking the operation of a stick shift."
1995-05-23	Japan's Auto Makers Feel Bite of U.S. Tariff	The high tariff imposed by the Clinton Administration on Japanese luxury cars imported into the United States has begun to bite, forcing Japanese companies to suspend exports and cut production. The Mazda Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company said today that they had temporarily halted exports to the United States of the models that would be subject to the 100 percent tariff.
1995-05-20	Honda Posts First Annual Earnings Increase in 6 Years	The Honda Motor Company said today that group net income in its latest fiscal year rose for the first time in six years, as higher sales in North America, Europe and Japan offset the effects of the strong yen. Net income more than doubled in the fiscal year, which ended on March 31, to 61.53 billion yen ($708 million at current exchange rates) from 23.70 billion yen in the prior fiscal year. In the fiscal fourth quarter, profit rose 38 percent to 10.5 billion yen. The full-year figure included a one-time gain from the Japanese company's sale of its stake in Rover Group of Britain. That bolstered net income by 12.8 billion yen; excluding the sale proceeds, Honda's group profit was 48.7 billion yen.
1995-05-17	100% TARIFFS SET ON 13 TOP MODELS OF JAPANESE CARS	Living up to its threat to impose harsh sanctions on Japan, the Clinton Administration placed a 100 percent tariff today on 13 luxury car models that accounted for $5.9 billion in sales in the United States last year, including the flagship products of Toyota, Nissan and Honda. The tariff, the largest ever imposed by the United States against any trading partner, is to go into effect at 12:01 Saturday morning. Customs inspectors will be instructed to double the wholesale price of every Toyota Lexus, Nissan Infiniti and a number of other cars that roll off Japanese transport ships -- an increase that would make the cars all but unsalable.

Just as a consumer service, you understand, for die-hards like me who refuse to quit. I could compare the cars, I thought, with the great old Cadillacs that had chrome ashtrays everywhere, commodious, each with its own lighter. I could whine about the Volvos whose shift levers pushed the ashtray shut when you put the transmission into park -- meaning that the easiest way to empty the tray was at speed.
1995-05-02	Sales Slowdown Worsened for Big Auto Makers in April	Most auto makers reported today that their sales plunged in April, in the most striking of four consecutive monthly declines, dashing their hopes that warm weather, stable interest rates and fattened incentives would bring buyers back to showrooms. Several companies, including the Chrysler Corporation and the Honda Motor Company, posted double-digit percentage decreases from a strong month a year earlier. Auto makers controlling two-thirds of the United States market reported sales today, and not one major company reported an increase.
1995-04-25	International Briefs; Honda Seeks Cuts	The Honda Motor Company has demanded that its Japanese suppliers reduce component prices by 3 percent in an effort to overcome pressures created by the surging yen, a company spokesman said yesterday. The spokesman said the company had regularly demanded a 2 percent reduction of total prices each year until this year, but the high value of the yen had forced Honda to ask for a 3 percent reduction. The cost of components and supplies accounts for 60 percent of Honda's total production costs, the spokesman said. He declined to say how much the additional price cut would save Honda, although an estimate of 15 billion yen, or about $180.4 million, has been given by a leading Japanese financial newspaper.
1995-04-06	In Honda Case, Tales of Dealers' Culture of Bribes	"A helicopter tour of Hawaii, $25,000 shopping sprees in Hong Kong and a swimming pool for his California home. Such were the bribes -- ""gratuities,"" he calls them -- that a former marketing executive at the American Honda Motor Company received from dozens of Honda dealers, according to his testimony during the last several days in Federal court here."
1995-04-04	Corruption Is Called Broad in Honda Case	A former executive at the American Honda Motor Company testified today that he believed the company's president knew he was taking bribes from dealers but did nothing to stop him. Indeed, the executive, Stanley James Cardiges, said in a criminal trial here that he suspected the president and other Japanese executives of also accepting bribes -- including a Mercedes-Benz, a Rolex watch and a painting worth $50,000. He said in court that he believed they joined in what he called the widespread corruption of the company's sales force in America during the 1980's and early 1990's when Honda cars were wildly popular and in short supply.
1995-03-02	Fall in Auto Sales Raises New Fears of Slowdown	Sales of cars and light trucks fell in February, in contrast to a robust period a year ago, according to company sales reports released today and estimates by analysts. The results were below the expectations of Wall Street analysts, heightening fears of an economic slowdown and sending auto stocks falling on the New York Stock Exchange.
1995-02-24	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; A Modest Low-key Campaign Belies the Case of Buying and Owning a New Chevrolet Cavalier	"""ANY car can be easy to buy,"" declares one of the mellow television commercials for General Motors' new compact, the Chevrolet Cavalier. ""The Cavalier is easy to own."" So far, however, the Cavalier is proving both statements false. It has been easy neither to buy nor own, because G.M. has had problems producing the car at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio."
1995-02-08	Guilty Plea In Honda Bribery Case	A former sales executive at the American Honda Motor Company pleaded guilty in Federal court yesterday to scheming with other company officials to accept bribes of up to $1 million and gifts that ranged from a Mercedes-Benz to a laser karaoke machine, in exchange for granting franchises to sell popular cars. The former executive, Stanley James Cardiges, is the highest-ranking Honda official and the 20th person to plead guilty in one of the largest Federal fraud investigations into the auto industry.
1995-01-19	An auto maker uses a cult artist's colorful images to make its mini-vans stand out from the pack.	ALTHOUGH much of his work hung in galleries and museums, Keith Haring also designed art to sell Swatch watches and Absolut vodka. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that four years after his death his colorful, genderless people have been resurrected -- or should that be reanimated -- to plug mini-vans for the American Honda Motor Company. Two gently comic television commercials and print advertisements for the Honda Odyssey use the figures to gild the image of the most unhip of vehicles. Honda hopes the campaign will ease the angst of baby boomers contemplating their first purchase of a mini-van, a vehicle so terrifying to them, apparently, that Honda dares not speak its name.
1995-01-09	New Honda Engine a Threat to Natural Gas	"The Honda Motor Company's announcement Friday that it had developed an engine that reduces tailpipe emissions by 90 percent could bolster several state governments' efforts to impose more stringent air-quality standards on auto makers and is also likely to hurt the natural gas industry. The Honda engine is powered by reformulated gasoline, and thus far the only vehicles that could meet the aggressive air standards, adopted first by California and requiring ""ultra-low emissions,"" were powered by natural gas."
1995-01-01	Speed Demons in Disguise	"""BUT officer, the school Christmas pageant starts in 10 minutes, and my daughter forgot her halo."" This excuse for going 45 in a 30-mile-an-hour zone is unlikely to make much headway if you are driving, say, a swoopy new Camaro. But it might work if you are behind the wheel of a Plymouth Voyager, with the built-in infant seat and Raffi tapes in the cassette player. But, then, hardly anyone would be tempted to speed in a mini-van."
1994-11-20	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda Odyssey; Another Shuttle in the Space Race	AS a longtime Honda fan, I have been looking forward to the company's new mini-van. Now that it is finally in the driveway, I am both pleased and not so pleased. The 1995 van, named the Odyssey, is based on the popular Honda Accord, and it carries the Accord's four-cylinder engine, which means it is somewhat underpowered. On the other hand, it is smaller than much of the competition, and its handling is definitely more carlike.
1994-11-06	A Patriotic Pitch: Honda Is American	FOR years, the Big Three auto companies and the United Automobile Workers have tried to make patriotism part of the car-buying mentality of Americans. As a marketing pitch, the effect of showroom jingoism has always been debatable -- so has its economic logic. Still, the idea that driving a Chevy or a Chrysler is a patriotic act, while owning a Honda or a Toyota is not, clearly appealed to some. And in their lobbying efforts and in their advertising, Detroit has long argued that buying American-made cars is good for the American economy and that buying imported cars is bad.
1994-10-17	Honda Set to Play Catch-Up in Mini-Van Market	The Honda Motor Company will try to plug a major hole in its product line on Thursday when it introduces its first mini-van. The name of the van, Odyssey, couldn't be more appropriate. That is because the Odyssey is only the first step in what is likely to be a long journey for Honda, as it tries to catch up in a booming part of the vehicle market that it has ignored for years.
1994-10-16	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Porsche 911 Carrera vs. Acura NSX; Two Faces of Hedonism	AND what is milord's pleasure today? The Day-Glo turquoise Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe, with its bulging postmodern fenders, souped-up engine and gadgets to monitor the gadgets? Or the screaming-red Honda Acura NSX, with its fighter-jet cockpit, all-aluminum body and 21st-century engineering? Such choices seem a throwback to an era when investment bankers roamed the earth in Lamborghinis and only hippies and plumbing contractors drove vans. But it's always nice to stay abreast of what's new and decadent, in case hedonism makes a comeback. Besides, it makes a change from all those car reviews focusing on cup holders, 5-mile-an-hour bumpers and ozone-friendly air-conditioning.
1994-09-17	Bargemusic With Mozart, Schumann and Chausson	It is easy to imagine, during a Bargemusic concert of chamber music under the Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn Heights, that you are actually sitting in a chamber: a living room, perhaps, with a low-slung but panoramic view of the financial ramparts of lower Manhattan. In fact, it is easy to imagine all sorts of things in the slightly giddy glow induced by the gentle rocking of the moored boat: might there, for example, be another group playing a Mozart trio on that fast-moving barge headed up the East River? (Oops! Suddenly the rocking is less gentle.) Well, O.K., so it was not always easy to keep the mind focused on Mozart's Piano Trio in C (K. 548). In current wisdom, hearing Mozart makes you smarter, as listeners were reminded by the cellist, Ronald Thomas; but perhaps not this piece, which is laid out from beginning to end for the piano, with the strings brought in as a mere afterthought.
1994-09-17	Music Notes	"Glass Wins Did you notice how a commercial for the Acura that ran early this year had music that sounded a lot like Philip Glass? Mr. Glass did. In fact, the composer thought the commercial's soundtrack music not only appropriated elements of his style but also was a direct copy of ""Opening,"" the first piece on his ""Glassworks"" album. So he hired a lawyer and threatened to sue the American Honda Motor Company and its advertising agency, Ketchum Communications. After several months of wrangling, the case was settled out of court, with Acura withdrawing the commercial and paying Mr. Glass a sum that both sides agreed not to disclose."
1994-08-30	Luxury Car Fight Turns Uncivilized	"Some blame the sport-utility vehicles, others the higher income taxes on the very wealthy. Some claim ""90's values"" have made the rich self-conscious, while still others argue that fears of health care cost-cutting have made doctors miserly. Whatever the reason, the luxury car market, roughly defined as cars costing more than $25,000, or about 13 percent of car sales in the United States, is in turmoil, and the calfskin gloves have come off."
1994-08-25	Honda Posts 15.8% Gain In Operations	Buoyed by strong sales of its cars in the United States, the Honda Motor Company reported a 15.8 percent increase in its fiscal first-quarter operating income today on a 5.8 percent revenue gain. Net income for the quarter, which ended June 30, nearly quadrupled from a year earlier, although much of the gain came from the sale of Honda's stake in the Rover Group Ltd., the British auto company.
1994-08-14	BEHIND THE WHEEL: Honda Passport; An Isuzu, Alias Honda, Travels Incognito	PASSPORT pictures are notorious, right? As often as not, they make you look like somebody else, and that is definitely the case with the Honda Passport, a new entry in the rapidly growing sport utility field. In photos and in the flesh, the Passport looks just like an Isuzu Rodeo, a fact that is not so surprising when you realize that is just what it is.
1994-08-05	Honda Says It May Drop U.S. Wagon	The Honda Motor Company is considering dropping the Accord station wagon it builds in Ohio from its United States product lineup, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president and chief executive, said today. Mr. Kawamoto said the move would be taken as part of a broad effort to strengthen its car line in the next two years. Honda would continue to produce the station wagons at its Marysville, Ohio, plant for export to Europe and Japan, where most of them are sold. The wagon is not popular in the United States, Mr. Kawamoto said, so the new, Japanese-built mini-van that Honda plans to sell here next year may replace it in American dealerships. Honda sells about 30,000 Accord station wagons annually in the United States; it exports 40,000, mostly to Japan.
1994-07-20	American Expansion For Honda	The Honda Motor Company, the first Japanese auto maker to build vehicles in the United States, announced a series of steps today that are intended to increase its North American car production. The expansion should help to mitigate the high costs, caused by the soaring value of the Japanese yen, of building cars in Japan and exporting them to the United States. The expansion, consistent with Honda's decade-old strategy of seeking growth mainly outside Japan, is expected to tap emerging Latin American markets, especially Mexico, and raise Honda's market share in the United States and Canada.
1994-07-10	Rick Hendrick's Days of Thunder	"THE life of Joseph R. Hendrick 3d sounds like a hard-driving country song set to the rhythm of a souped-up car, with lyrics that celebrate life in the fast lane. He has owned a race car team with Paul Newman, hung out with Tom Cruise and helped found basketball's Charlotte Hornets. In the movie ""Days of Thunder,"" the car dealer and race car owner portrayed by Randy Quaid was modeled on Mr. Hendrick."
1994-07-07	Japanese Made Gains In June Vehicle Sales	The leading Japanese auto makers posted strong sales and gains in market share in June, driving up total car and light-truck sales for the month despite a weaker performance by the Big Three. Over all, sales sustained the moderate growth they have managed since easing off in May, sticking to a pace that analysts say bodes well for continued slow growth in the economy. Sales of cars and light trucks rose 6.8 percent compared with a strong period a year earlier.
1994-06-26	"BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Celica GT vs. Acura Integra GS-R;
Of Running Shoes and Ruby Slippers"	"DRIVING the new Toyota Celica is like wearing a fine leather dress shoe. You can't run fast in it, and it costs more than other pumps might. But it's supple and sleek, fitting your foot as if it were custom-made. You feel, and look, great.

Driving the Acura Integra is like wearing a well-engineered athletic shoe. You can tear up a track. You feel, and look, macho."
1994-06-25	Punitive Damage Awards by Juries Must Be Subject to Judicial Review, Justices Rule	In a ruling likely to give new ammunition to the effort to limit punitive damage awards, the Supreme Court ruled today that juries cannot have the last word on punitive damages and that states must make some form of judicial review available. The immediate effect of the 7-to-2 decision was limited, because among the 50 states and the Federal Government, only Oregon provides no judicial review of the size of a jury's damage award. The Court today set aside a $5 million punitive damage award against the Honda Motor Company, won by an Oregon man who was injured when a three-wheeled all-terrain vehicle flipped over on him as he drove it up a steep embankment.
1994-06-05	BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda Accord Station Wagon; Good for People, But Not for Bureaus	TWO of my lesser charms, or so says my wife, are that I am a pack rat and that I am occasionally lazy. As usual, she is half right. It is true that the last thing I threw away was a water bill from 1959. But I am lazy on more than just an occasional basis, a fact reflected by the bottles and cans that fill one of the rooms in our basement.
1994-05-22	A Switch for Rahal and Groff	Bobby Rahal and his teammate, Mike Groff, were out-run in the last 20 minutes of qualifying today at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, but quickly re-qualified in faster cars. The victim in the process was the Honda Indy-engine project. John Paul Jr. (222.500 miles an hour) and Scott Goodyear (220.737) filled two of the three open spots in the 33-car lineup. With 29 minutes left in qualifying, Mauricio Gugelmin requalified in a Reynard-Cosworth at 223.104. Mark Smith filled the last spot in a Lola-Cosworth at 220.683.
1994-05-13	Honda Suspected Wrongdoing for 3 Years	The American Honda Motor Company first became aware of allegations of wrongdoing in its sales force three years ago, long before the Government started an investigation of company executives who took bribes for granting dealerships and providing popular cars to existing dealers, a lawyer for Honda acknowledged in an interview this week. But even though Honda began its own investigation in 1991, the Japanese auto maker began to share the results of its internal inquiry with law enforcement officials only last October, well after a Federal criminal investigation was under way. During that time, the company also apparently did not disclose the existence of its inquiry to securities regulators or shareholders.
1994-03-15	How 2 Dealers' Squabble Broke a Scandal at Honda	The corruption scandal engulfing the sales organization of the Honda Motor Company began a year ago as part of a squabble between two Acura dealers in this quiet corner of New Hampshire. Richard M. Nault, a car dealer from nearby Manchester, sued Honda in 1989 after his Acura dealership first foundered and then was canceled by Honda, which markets both Honda and Acura cars. Mr. Nault contended that one reason his Acura store had done poorly was that he could not get enough cars.
1994-03-15	PROSECUTORS LINK HONDA FRAUD CASES TO U.S. EXECUTIVES	Federal prosecutors are uncovering a long-running fraud in which American executives of the Honda Motor Company pocketed more than $10 million in bribes and kickbacks paid by car dealers. In return, the dealers received permission to open lucrative dealerships and obtained scarce Honda automobiles that they could sell at a large profit. Some of the payments came in the form of college tuition for the son of one former Honda executive, as well as gifts like watches, jewelry and barbecue grills for other Honda officials.
1994-02-24	Bribe-Taking By Honda Officials Seen	After a yearlong inquiry, Federal prosecutors in New Hampshire are preparing to charge more than a dozen current and former American Honda Motor Company executives with accepting bribes from dealers in exchange for franchises and hot-selling Honda models from 1986 through 1991. Prosecutors are likely to file the charges, which include racketeering, bribery, extortion and obstruction of justice, before mid-March, according to officials close to the investigation. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said prosecutors believed the Honda executives -- both Japanese and American -- would plead guilty to the charges. Other executives are expected to be charged later.
1994-02-22	Acura Tire Wear Comes Under Fire	The Acura NSX is hardly your typical car. An aluminum-bodied rear-wheel-drive sports car with a 270-horsepower engine, it lists for $65,000, can hold the road at 140 miles an hour and was acclaimed at its introduction in 1990 as a marvel of Japanese automotive technology. But its tire wear has been far from typical, as well. In some cases, the rear tires have been found bald of tread after 3,000 miles.
1994-02-22	Honda Plans To Cut Ties With Rover	The Honda Motor Company said today that it would end its ownership ties with the Rover Group in response to the sale of the British automobile company to BMW. Honda, which had made no secret of the sense of betrayal it felt when the controlling stake in its longtime partner was sold, also hinted that it would end many of its collaborations with Rover and set up a more independent operation in Europe.
1994-01-28	A Dozen Companies Chosen for 'Lemons'	"Advertisers including Amoco and American Honda Motor were among a dozen to achieve the dubious distinction of being named ""honorees"" at the ninth annual Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon Awards ceremony yesterday in Washington, sponsored by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The so-called awards are designated by a group of national consumer, environmental and health advocate organizations. It selects ads it considers ""the most misleading, unfair or irresponsible"" for the year."
1994-01-15	Justices to Decide on a Right Of Review of a Jury's Award	The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the right to judicial review of a jury's award of damages is constitutionally required to protect defendants against excessive judgments. The case is a challenge to an Oregon rule that makes the size of jury awards unreviewable either by the state trial judge or by an appellate court. The Supreme Court appeal was brought by the Honda Motor Company, which an Oregon jury ordered to pay $735,000 in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages to a man who was injured when a three-wheel all-terrain vehicle made by Honda flipped over on him.
1993-10-24	Feeling the Bumps in the Road At the Tokyo Auto Show	IN 1985, visitors to the auto show here were treated to a preview of Honda's new Accord, a car that crossed the Pacific and outsold all American models for three years running. The 1989 show marked the first sighting of Lexus, the Toyota luxury sedan that displaced Cadillacs, Mercedeses and Jaguars from garages of the wealthy. The once-obscure Tokyo Motor Show, held every other year, had suddenly become a gallery for the dynamic imagination of Japan's auto industry, whose creations provoked nightmares from Detroit to Turin.
1993-10-08	Acura Plant May Be Built In the U.S.	"Acura, the Honda Motor Company's luxury car division, is considering building an assembly plant in the United States within the next three to five years, the general manager of the division said today. The official, Rich Thomas, said the company had made no final decision. But, he said, ""If we bring something here, it will probably be a new model, and it will probably be an exportable model."""
1993-10-03	Honda Rolls Out Its New Accord	"IT was noon and traffic was oozing on New York's 42d Street. I was pointed west, momentarily moribund in front of Grand Central Terminal when an eastbound 5.0-liter Mustang crept alongside. ""Hey,"" the driver said, ""is that thing smaller than it used to be? It looks smaller."""
1993-09-20	Honda Set To Increase U.S. Output	The Honda Motor Company plans to make all Accords and Civics for sale in the United States at its plants in Ohio, eliminating exports from Japan of those models, a spokesman said this weekend. The shift of production to the United States is part of a long-range revamping that has been accelerated by the rise of the Japanese yen, which has made it much more difficult for automobiles produced in Japan to sell profitably in the United States.
1993-09-12	Indy-Car Owners Carry Competition Far From Roar of the Track	The last two weeks have provided evidence that winning an Indy-car race often involves competition that occurs far away from the track. On Aug. 29 in Vancouver, Scott Goodyear, Bobby Rahal and Al Unser Jr. -- among other drivers -- suddenly found themselves a lot closer to winning than they have all season. Meanwhile, Emerson Fittipaldi, Paul Tracy, Nigel Mansell and Mario Andretti, who had been dominating the series, were struggling. One reason was that parts for the Lola chassis that were not previously available to every Lola customer suddenly were.
1993-09-10	Honda Marries Rahal	After months of testing and indecision over the rules, Honda announced yesterday that it would supply engines to the Indy-car driver BOBBY RAHAL starting next season. Rahal, who is a Honda dealer, won the 1986 Indianapolis 500 and his third Indy-car title in 1992, his first year as an Indy-car team owner. Rahal had been testing the Honda engine since June, but the company had been hesitant to join the series because of rules that might force it to supply more drivers with its engines than it wishes to. By announcing that Rahal will field a car for a teammate next year -- most likely MIKE GROFF -- the chances are slim that Honda will have to supply an engine to any other driver next season.
1993-09-08	Honda Dealer Group Chooses an Agency	The Philadelphia office of Earle Palmer Brown, which has handled advertising for the Tri-State Honda dealers association of southern New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, has been awarded the assignment for an expanded association that absorbs the defunct dealer group in New York, Connecticut and northern New Jersey. Combined billings of the new Five-State Honda Automobile Dealers Association were estimated at $14 million. The assignment follows the dissolving this spring of the metropolitan New York dealers group, known as the Tri-Honda Dealers, which fell apart amid internal squabbling. The American Honda Motor Company, which franchises local dealers around the country, had been unhappy that its dealers in such a large market were disorganized.
1993-09-02	Honda to Hold Base Price on Accord Model	Honda is maintaining the base price of its new 1994 Accord family sedan at $14,330 -- the same as the current model -- which could provoke protectionist pressure by the Big Three auto makers, which say they expect Japanese car makers to raise prices to reflect the stronger yen. Preparing to defend against possible attacks by Detroit's auto makers, Honda executives and engineers here explained today how they cut costs to avoid a price increase on the stripped-down Accord, modestly raised prices on other models and still expect to remain profitable.
1993-08-31	3 Japan Auto Makers' Debt on Credit Watch	The Standard & Poor's Corporation placed more than $25 billion of debt of the top three Japanese auto makers on credit watch with negative implications today, in a move that could eventually raise the borrowing costs for the Japanese automobile industry. S.& P.'s move was further verification of the deteriorating financial position of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company, which have been hurt by the soaring value of the yen and sharper competition from Detroit's Big Three auto makers.
1993-08-27	Honda's Star Gets Another Sequel	Since January, when the Ford Taurus eclipsed the Honda Accord as the nation's best-selling car model, the auto industry has been waiting for Honda's counterpunch, the new Accord. The first public demonstration of that model takes place Wednesday at a Honda assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. Even rivals concede that the Accord has been the benchmark against which family sedans are measured, raising this question: Can the Accord do it again?
1993-08-01	From Acura, a Third-Generation Integra	HONDA's Acura Division has come a long way in the seven short years since it arrived on these shores as the leader in what has since become a Japanese rush to produce luxury automobiles. First, there was the Legend sedan, followed by an elegant coupe. Then came the entry-level Integra, the Vigor sports sedan and the spectacular all-aluminum NSX sports car. And a new network of dealers was set up to distance the nameplate from Honda's reputation for cheap little cars.
1993-07-28	HONDA TO START NEW VENTURE IN CHINA	Just three weeks after the Chinese Government began cracking down on runaway economic growth, the Honda Motor Company is shrugging off concerns of an economic squeeze to move ahead with its first passenger car production agreement in China. The Japanese auto maker said yesterday that it had signed an accord with the Yancheng Automobile Company of Guangzhou, near Hong Kong, to assemble Civic sedan passenger cars at Yancheng's existing factory, beginning in November.
1993-06-29	Honda Settles on Dealer's Charge of Bribes	The Honda Motor Company has settled a lawsuit by one of its dealers who charged that his Acura franchise had failed because Honda did not provide him with enough cars. The suit by the dealer, Richard Nault of Concord, N.H., was settled last week just as the trial was to begin in United States District Court in Concord. It brought to light charges of corruption against Honda and set off a Federal investigation.
1993-06-16	How Honda Slipped From Its Perch	Honda. For years the name struck fear and awe into the American auto industry. But with a strong yen forcing up prices and with many Detroit models flourishing on the strength of improved quality and creative design, the Honda Motor Company is stumbling -- still profitable, but not the powerhouse it once was.
1993-05-30	New Coupe Completes Civic's Line	IN mystery stories and on television, somebody always seems to be slipping a lock with a credit card. And while my experience with recalcitrant latches is limited, I have been around long enough to discover that this method never works. Or almost never. I tried it one morning last week on a balky ashtray after a frustrating drive home the night before, tugging and fiddling in the dark and finally opening the moon roof to flick my ashes at the stars.
1993-05-27	Onetime Wizard at Honda Re-emerges in Video Games	A man who had once been considered one of the brightest executives at the Honda Motor Company will take a high position at Sega Enterprises Ltd., the video-game maker, and try to help it in its quest to catch up with Nintendo, the world leader. Shoichiro Irimajiri, 53, will join Sega as an executive vice president in charge of research, development and manufacturing, the company announced today. The appointment is considered something of a coup for Sega, whose managers have been stretched thin by the explosive growth of the last few years.
1993-05-04	Restore Trust, Honda Stresses	"Responding to assertions that its retail-dealer and distribution network had been tainted by corruption, the Honda Motor Company urged its dealers in the United States today ""to work together in order to reinforce our customers' trust in the Honda organization and in our business operations."" The company's statement -- signed by Koichi Amemiya, president of Honda's American sales subsidiary -- was sent by computer to the 1,291 Honda and Acura dealers in the United States. On Sunday, The New York Times published allegations by some dealers and Honda workers that company executives had been bribed so that dealers could secure more cars and franchises."
1993-05-02	Honda's Ugly Little Secret	"TOM ROULETTE opened a Honda dealership in Painesville, Ohio, in 1978, offering what were becoming the hottest cars in America. But more than one Honda Motor Company executive told him, he recalls, that to get all the cars he wanted to sell he would have to ""play the game."" During the next eight years, Mr. Roulette concedes, he played the game faithfully, showering Honda executives with gifts -- a car, jewelry, a stereo system, barbecue grills and thousands of dollars in cash. On some Christmases he received a list specifying what executives expected from Santa. One year, he recalls, he sent his wife to buy a watch costing more than $2,000 for the wife of a Honda executive."
1993-04-15	Sales Rise For Vehicles Built in U.S.	Sales of domestically built vehicles excluding those built by the Ford Motor Company rose 14.8 percent in early April from the corresponding period a year ago. In a deviation from its pattern of reporting on the same day as other auto makers, Ford said it would release its 10-day sales figures on Thursday. The Chrysler Corporation does not provide partial monthly figures; its sales are estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports. 'Demand Is Only So-So' Some analysts cautioned that demand could be slightly better or slightly worse once hard data from Ford and Chrysler were available.
1993-03-29	Back to School for Honda Workers	For the 5,400 workers who assemble the popular Honda Accord at a factory here, the unthinkable finally happened. Tougher competition from the Big Three and tepid demand for cars have forced the Honda Motor Company to trim production significantly for the first time in the plant's 10-year history. Organizers from the United Automobile Workers union, which waged an unsuccessful campaign to organize the plant, had warned years earlier that if Honda ever slipped, workers would suffer without protection of a union contract.
1993-03-26	Japanese Mix and Match Auto Plants and Markets	Every so often on the Toyota Motor Corporation assembly line here, a Toyota Camry takes shape with the steering wheel on the right side. But more surprising than the steering wheel's location are the cars' destinations: the ports of Tawara, Japan, and Sheerness, England. After a decade of making cars in America, Japanese auto makers like Toyota and Honda are turning their ships around and sending American-made cars to Japan, Taiwan, the Middle East and Europe.
1993-03-18	Rahal to Test Engine	BOBBY RAHAL, whose team has long been rumored as the one that will use Honda's Indy-car engine if and when the company enters the sport in 1994, will begin testing that engine next month. But in announcing the deal yesterday, TOM ELLIOTT, an American Honda Motor Company official, said the company still hasn't made up its mind about entering races with the motor next season. IndyCar, the sanctioning group for most of the series, recently enacted a rule that would require companies like Honda to supply a minimum number of teams with motors in the first and second years that they compete in the series.
1993-02-25	Japanese Cars Get British Accents	"The Japanese auto makers, having entrenched themselves in the United States, are turning to what is perhaps the world's most hotly contested and most promising market: Europe. Following the same basic strategy that helped push their share of the United States market to 30 percent from 20 percent during the last decade, Toyota, Nissan and Honda are starting to produce cars in large numbers in Europe. They are building efficient new plants in British towns like this one in the English Midlands, home to a $1 billion Toyota factory that opened in December. The goal, as it was in the United States, is to sidestep ""voluntary"" quotas that limit their exports from Japan."
1993-02-05	Honda Stalls Indy-Car Plans	Honda, which announced last month that it planned to enter Indy-car racing in 1994, is reconsidering because of rules that could require the company to build as many as 100 racing engines by 1995. The company had planned to announce which team would use its engine in 1994 next Tuesday, said Tom Elliott, executive vice president of American Honda. But, Elliott said yesterday, that was canceled after a decision by IndyCar, the group that sanctions the 15 Indy-car races other than the Indianapolis 500.
1993-01-08	Honda to Build Engines for Indy Race Cars	Eager to portray itself more convincingly as an American institution, the Honda Motor Company's United States subsidiary said today that it would begin building engines for race cars in the Indianapolis 500 and associated races, starting in 1994. Honda executives said they expected the racing program to help in the marketing of Honda and Acura cars and to provide racing experience for the company's American engineers and technicians.
1993-01-07	With Money No Object, Ford Beats Honda	The Ford Motor Company celebrated with a parade today as its Taurus model finished first -- by a stadium lot full of cars -- to win an industry rivalry for the nation's best-selling car. Only instead of the age-old fracas between Ford and Chevrolet, this time it was a showdown with the dreaded Japanese and the celebrated Honda Accord, which has been the American favorite for three years running.
1993-01-05	Playing a Game of Numbers; Race For No. 1 Nears End For Taurus and Accord	In the contest to outsell a rival model, the winner is often the auto maker that reports last. Fearing this, the Ford Motor Company suggested to the Honda Motor Company that the two auto makers exchange sales totals on Wednesday morning to make sure there are no last-minute additions. Honda's answer: No thanks.
1992-12-09	Leasing Is Main Weapon In Battle for Top-Selling Car	WILL the Ford Taurus overtake the Honda Accord as America's best-selling car? With just a few weeks left in the year, Ford has its work cut out. Through the end of November, Ford was lagging by roughly 15,000 cars. But perhaps more interesting than the ultimate winner of these bragging rights is the marketing strategy of both auto makers of using low-cost leases to pump up sales. Although the lease deals are fairly close at first blush -- $199 a month for the Accord and $248 a month for the Taurus -- they are yielding different and noteworthy results in satisfying consumers.
1992-11-26	Honda Cut From U.S. Auto Group	"The United States auto makers' main trade organization today ejected its only Japanese member, the Honda Motor Company. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association explained that it was limiting membership to the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation ""to focus on the common issues and interests that are unique to the domestic manufacturers."" The action signals that the Big Three plan to strengthen their lobbying efforts on trade and other issues."
1992-11-24	Honda Names Woman To Head Plant in Ohio	Following the defection of two top executives to BMW, the Honda Motor Company has named Susan J. Insley to supervise Honda's engine plant in Anna, Ohio, making her the highest-ranking woman in American automotive manufacturing. In a field dominated by male engineers, the appointment of Ms. Insley, who is 46 years old, is doubly unusual because of her background as a lawyer, teacher and legislative aide.
1992-10-09	Honda's Nationality Proves Troublesome For Free-Trade Pact	In a factory here covering the area of 19 football fields, Honda is making engines with American and Japanese parts that will be put into Civics assembled in Canada. Question: what nationality is the engine, and, ultimately, the car? The answer has bedeviled American and Canadian officials for three years and is at the heart of a shin-kicking battle that could bog down Congressional approval of the recently negotiated North American Free Trade Agreement.
1992-09-13	Stubborn Taurus Tramples on the Heels of the Accord	"They're calling it ""Showdown in Motown,"" a title bout between the Honda Accord, champion for three consecutive years, and the Ford Taurus, the leading contender for best-selling car in America. When a slightly restyled Taurus was introduced a year ago, some reviewers criticized the Ford Motor Company for not undertaking a more far-reaching overhaul. But the model has sold far better than the critics expected, and the Taurus has continued to close in on the Accord, whose sales peaked at 417,000 in 1990, a year when Ford sold 313,000 Tauruses."
1992-09-12	Honda Cutting Ties to Auto Racing	The Honda Motor Company said today that it would end its participation in Formula One auto racing at the end of this season -- a sign of changing priorities and tough times for the automobile industry. Honda, which supplies engines to Formula One teams, said it wanted to turn its attention to making low-polluting engines, not superfast ones. By suspending its development of racing car engines, Honda will free 100 engineers to work on emissions control, alternative-fuel technology and other projects the company would not specify.
1992-09-09	HONDA IS RAISING PRICES 2.5% FOR 1993 ACURA MODELS	The American Honda Motor Company's Acura car division said it would increase the prices of its 1993 models an average 2.5 percent, or $582, from similarly equipped 1992 models.
1992-09-06	Unwrapping the del Sol, Honda's Sporty New Civic	"Forget for a moment that Honda's new del Sol is an innovative open-air competitor to the Mazda Miata and the Mercury Capri, among others. What is really neat and worth remarking is that thing right there in the middle of the dashboard, a panel that slides up and hides the radio from would-be thieves. City dwellers are going to love it. And never mind that as soon as those urbanites throw away their ""No-Radio-in-Car"" signs, the audio rustlers are going to figure it all out. By that time, the del Sol's owners are going to love the car for a lot of other reasons."
1992-08-17	Japan Auto Pact Seen	Four Japanese automotive companies have agreed to standardize their parts to reduce costs, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported today. The report said the companies -- Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha and Kawasaki Heavy Industries -- would work out the details next month.
1992-08-05	Honda Roof Can Go Topless Without Taxing One's Back	Since the earliest days of driving, automotive engineers have tried to enhance driving pleasure by finding devices that let fair weather into a vehicle and keep foul weather out. Some of the latest innovations in open-air driving are incorporated in the Honda Civic del Sol two-seat roadster, which is being introduced in the United States on Wednesday. The 1993 del Sol, a successor to the CRX hatchback, features a removable roof panel that stores in the car's trunk.
1992-05-24	From Honda, An All-New '92 Prelude	THE question comes up time and again: What kind of car should I buy? I get it on the phone, in the mail, from friends. And, like a good psychoanalyst, I answer the question with a question. What kind of car do you want ? Because you won't really be happy with anything else. But the answer is never easy. It depends on what kind of vehicle you need, obviously, and on how much you want to pay. It depends on how long you will keep it, on your ego, on a balance of safety and pizazz and cost of operation.
1992-05-21	Honda Decentralizes Management	The Honda Motor Company restructured its senior management today for the second time in 14 months, in an effort to decentralize its worldwide operations and give regional executives more power. A Honda spokesman, Shigeaki Kato, said the company was accelerating its trend toward decentralization and greater personal responsibility for decision making.
1992-03-22	The Civic VX: a Honda for the Long Haul	IN the scheme of things, it isn't all that long ago that I was paying 21 cents for a gallon of gas, with S & H Green Stamps as part of the bargain. On the other hand, those days in the middle 1950's seem like a time of long-lost innocence. It was eons ago that I was pulling up to the pump and asking for a buck's worth of gas. I got it without a sneer, too, and it would take me out and about for what passed as an evening's fun.
1992-03-19	In New Jolt, Honda Loses	The Honda Motor Company, already struggling to recover from sales slumps in the United States and Japan, was jolted today by the sudden resignation of one of its most vital executives for health reasons. The executive, Shoichiro Irimajiri, was president of Honda of America in the 1980's and the chief architect of Honda's manufacturing operations in the United States. He is credited with turning them into one of Japan's biggest overseas manufacturing success stories.
1992-03-04	U.S. Tariffs on Hondas Roil Japanese	"A simmering dispute over the national origin of Honda automobiles assembled in Canada has flared in the last two days into the newest political battle between the United States and Japan, with the Japanese Government declaring today that it is beginning an investigation into whether the Bush Administration is ""discriminating against Japanese interests."" The announcement came in protest of a ruling on Monday by the United States Customs Service that the Honda Motor Company owed millions of dollars in tariffs for Civic autos imported from Canada because they contained an insufficient percentage of parts made in North America. Canada has reached an opposite conclusion on the key point in the ruling, saying engines made in Ohio for the Civics qualified for duty-free treatment under the United States-Canada free-trade agreement. Japan Sees Political Motives"
1992-03-03	Duties Set On Honda Over Parts	The Bush Administration ruled today that Honda owed millions of dollars in tariffs because Civic autos imported from Canada did not contain enough North American parts to qualify for duty-free treatment. The move is likely to intensify the nation's trade tensions with both Canada and Japan. The United States Customs Service did not disclose the amount of money owed or the number of cars involved. But Honda said the United States was trying to collect $16.5 million in duties on 90,000 vehicles imported into the United States from Jan. 1, 1989, through March 31, 1990.
1992-03-03	Hondas for Muscovites	The Honda Motor Company has announced plans to open a direct-sales network in the Commonwealth of Independent States, beginning with the opening of a sales office in Moscow this month. Honda will become the first Japanese auto maker to begin direct sales in the former Soviet Union.
1992-02-27	Detroit Leaning on Japan, in Both Senses	"When Lee A. Iacocca, the outspoken chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, demands that America take a stand against Japanese car imports surely he must not be talking about car No. 11AMRXML2D19W-C06, which rolled off the line here the other day. The car was produced by teams of Japanese workers all wearing neat uniforms with ""Mitsubishi Motors"" emblazoned on the back. But the sporty. bright red model is a Dodge Stealth, made by Mitsubishi, and sold in America starting at about $17,000. And the only thing that makes it seem American is the word ""Dodge"" etched in the front bumper. Mr. Iacocca made no mention of Mitsubishi's Nagoya plant when he visited Japan with President Bush in January, and these days people at the plant say as little as possible about Mr. Iacocca. Confused Feelings ""We feel a little funny about him,"" Kozo Naruse, the deputy general manager, conceded the other day, shaking his head. ""Here he is talking about keeping Japanese cars out of America, and every day we come to work and make very good Chryslers."""
1992-02-15	European Car a Winner	"To the Editor: In ""Why Favor Less Sturdy Japanese Cars?"" (letter, Jan. 27), David J. Rivkin states that a Road & Track comparison of a European and two Japanese cars named one of the Japanese cars a winner, though we scored the European car higher."
1992-02-12	Honda Protests Customs' Audit	"The Honda Motor Company, stung by adverse rulings in a Customs Service audit, today accused the Federal agency of unfairly manipulating the audit to achieve ""a politically correct conclusion"" that its cars have less American content than the auto maker contends. The accusations were contained in a letter to Carol B. Hallett, the Customs Commissioner, from Scott Whitlock, Honda's executive vice president of United States manufacturing. Honda has extensive manufacturing operations in Marysville, Ohio, and at other locations in North America."
1992-02-02	From Acura, A Legend To Live With	MY friend Sally can tell you that Cal Ripken batted .323 last season and that Mozart's favorite drink was Pilsener (although he also liked punch.) She is smart about a lot of things, but she is also somewhat benighted when it comes to seat belts. I give her a ride now and again, and she usually manages to get half the belt around her and half of it behind her. Still, she wants to wear it, and she always asks if the car du jour has an air bag. Alas, the answer usually is no. But manufacturers are cozying up to the concerns of people like Sally, and more and more they are wisely peddling safety.
1992-01-19	Guess We Just Don't Figure in U.S. Car Makers' Marketing Plan	To the Editor: While experts decide who to blame for the American auto industry's problems, I'd like to tell my story of trying to buy an American car.
1992-01-10	A Trade Mission Ends in Tension As the 'Big Eight' of Autos Meet	"President Bush's hopes of returning home with what he called an ""action plan"" to help Detroit began to unwind late this afternoon, in one of the most unlikely business meetings in the history of Japanese-American industrial rivalries. The chief executives of the world's eight largest auto makers -- three American, five Japanese -- gathered face to face in a hotel room in downtown Tokyo, with everyone in the room clearly understanding, and no one saying, that the American industry will probably never gain back the ground it has lost to Japanese imports and to Japanese cars made in American plants. A Tense Hour It was apparently the first time executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met directly with their counterparts at Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, which together now control more than a third of the American auto market. After a tense hour, during which the Japanese told their guests that American industry needed to transform itself radically, and the Americans warned that the time was long past when ""mere declarations of intent"" to open markets would suffice, Lee A. Iacocca, the fiery head of the ailing Chrysler Corporation, finally spoke up."
1991-11-04	Rare Miscalculation by Honda	Among automotive cognoscenti, the Honda Motor Company sits on a tall pedestal for its almost uncanny ability to aim at a market niche and fill it with a wildly popular car. But after Honda's introduction of its Accord station wagon, that pedestal is not quite so high. Nearly a year after Honda showed off its first Accord wagons at its Marysville, Ohio, assembly plant, American sales are running at about 2,000 cars a month, well short of the 3,000 cars Honda had hoped for.
1991-10-18	Groups Are Critical Of Honda Commercial	A new Honda television commercial, which uses time-lapse photography to show a rain forest sprouting around a Honda Civic VX, has been criticized by advocacy groups for supposedly presenting a misleading pro-environmental statement.
1991-10-17	Honda Ready to Show a Car That Gets 100 Miles a Gallon	At the Tokyo Motor Show next week, the Honda Motor Company is expected to display a prototype of an unusual two-seat passenger car whose fuel efficiency it says could top 100 miles a gallon. Though most auto makers have created ultrahigh-efficiency prototypes for research and demonstration, the Honda vehicle is apparently intended to look like a model that could be put into production.
1991-09-22	ABOUT NEW JERSEY	"BY now nearly everyone who lives within 100 miles of New York City has heard of Danny, the schnook from Hoboken who sells Hondas without trying. Danny, forlorn Danny, never has the chance to sell because people yell ""I'll take it"" before he says a word. He is successful anyway and when, on one of the television commercials he stars in, he is shown outside his modest Hoboken home, Hoboken turns out to look an awful lot like Fanwood, or Cedar Grove, or any of the hundreds of mild-mannered, front-lawned, attached-garage, quarter-acre suburbs around the state."
1991-09-20	A Fuel-Efficient Grab for Power	About 18 years ago, the Honda Motor Company got a lot of attention when it displayed its Civic, which had an unusual, fuel-efficient engine that satisfied pollution concerns. In two weeks, Honda will introduce a Civic model whose engine could have a big impact on a current debate: whether fuel-efficient cars need come only in small packages.
1991-09-16	Honda Sets U.S. Exports To France	"The American Honda Motor Company says it has received ""verbal approval"" to import American-made Honda Accord station wagons into France after several months in which French authorities had barred the cars. If the auto maker receives formal import certification from French customs authorities this week, as expected, a potential trade conflict between the United States and France will be headed off."
1991-09-06	Goodby, Berlin Loses Honda Dealers' Group	"The Northern California Honda Dealers Ad Association is looking for another advertising agency with Honda experience to replace the incumbent, Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein, San Francisco, on its $5 million to $6 million account. The search began when Goodby, Berlin became a finalist in a review for the $90 million American Isuzu Motors account, said Jim McDonald, the association's head. Now that the agency has won the Isuzu account, he added, the association wants a new agency to ""be up and running"" in a matter of weeks."
1991-08-06	Soichiro Honda, Auto Innovator, Is Dead at 84	Soichiro Honda, a rebellious auto mechanic who defied the Japanese Government and built one of the world's biggest and most innovative auto companies from the ruins of World War II, died today. He was 84 years old. Mr. Honda, who appeared to be in vigorous health until he was hospitalized recently, died of liver failure, a spokesman for Honda Motor Company said.
1991-07-31	Fuel Efficiency: New Japan Coup?	In a challenge to American auto makers, two of Japan's leading auto manufacturers say they will equip some of their compact cars with redesigned engines this fall that burn far less gasoline with virtually no loss of power. The new engines improve mileage by achieving more complete combustion of gasoline. But some industry experts and Big Three executives disputed the mileage claims and doubted the new engines could be used in any but the smallest and lightest cars without increasing engine emissions.
1991-06-27	Honda Faults A U.S. Audit Of Its Imports	Senior executives of the Honda Motor Company have met with top Treasury officials to express concern about the status of a Government audit suggesting that the company may owe millions of dollars in duties on cars imported into the United States from Canada, lawyers for the auto maker said today. Donald Harrison, a lawyer for Honda, said the company wanted to make clear to American officials that it was strongly committed to the American market. In addition, he said, Honda protested the disclosure of details of the audit, being conducted by the United States Customs Service.
1991-06-10	All-Terrain Vehicles Recalled	The American Honda Motor Company has announced a recall of 730 of its 1991 four-wheel-drive all-terrain vehicles because their brakes could fail. The front brake hose of the TRX300FW model may contact the edge of the front fender, a result that could damage the hose, the company said Saturday. The model has independent front brakes and rear brakes, and the latter would function if the front brakes failed, said a company spokesman, Kurt Antonius.
1991-05-04	Honda Raises Prices	The American Honda Motor Company raised prices today for Honda and Acura cars sold in the United States. The average price of a Honda car rose by $92, or six-tenths of 1 percent, and the average price of an Acura went up $197, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, the company said. The company attributed the higher prices to increased manufacturing costs.
1991-04-21	From Honda, an All-American Wagon	Among my friends is a guy named John. Like me, he is sometimes a grouch, but we get along -- arguing about everything -- and he is proud of his curmudgeonry. Less perversely, he is also proud of his lifelong unionism and rightly proud of his patriotism. But he is on his third Honda. That says a lot about the state of the domestic car business, but it also says something about the way that Honda builds and sells automobiles. They are simply so well engineered and so well put together that it takes more than a strong streak of nationalism to give them a pass.
1991-04-07	"Tech Notes;
Adding a Cylinder for Kick"	Since the earliest automobiles, most cars have had two, four, six or eight cylinders. An even number of cylinders allows the up-and-down motion of each piston to be offset by another piston. An engine with an odd number of cylinders tends to vibrate more. Nevertheless, a few companies have used engines with three or five cylinders. Honda's new four-door Vigor comes with a five-cylinder engine (right) so as to pack more horsepower in a small engine compartment. Honda engineers dampened the vibration by careful timing of each piston's stroke. Their design also incorporates hydraulic devices at points where the engine is attached to the car's frame. The all-aluminum engine displaces 2.5 liters and produces 176 horsepower. By contrast, the Honda Accord has a 2.2 liter four-cylinder engine that produces 125 horsepower.
1991-04-04	U.S.-Made Honda Wagons in Japan	The Honda Motor Company began selling a new compact station wagon model in Japan that was designed and manufactured in the United States. The cars, derived from Honda's popular Accord model, have a base price of $19,580 in Japan at current exchange rates. The same vehicle, with the steering wheel on the left-hand side for American drivers, went on sale in the United States in December, with a base price of $17,300. Honda makes left-hand-drive and right-hand-drive vehicles at its plant in Marysville, Ohio. In 1988, the company began shipping two-door Accord coupes from Marysville to Japan. While those cars were designed and engineered in Japan, the Accord station wagon was developed by Honda's American employees. The car maker also plans to export about 4,000 wagons a year to Europe.
1991-03-29	New Honda Has 5 Cylinders	The Honda Motor Company introduced a new four-door sedan today with a five-cylinder engine. The mid-sized Vigor will cost $22,000 to $26,000 and is scheduled to go on sale next month. The Vigor is intended to expand Honda's line of luxury and performance cars and to fill a gap between the company's Integra sports sedan and the flagship Legend model.
1991-03-06	Honda Stores Cars	About 2,000 new Honda Accords, the best-selling car in the United States for the last two years, are being stored as the Japanese manufacturer resists layoffs at its United States assembly plant, the company said. The cars are being kept at a former Army depot in Marion, Ohio, about 25 miles northeast of the Accord assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio, a Honda Motor Company spokesman, Kurt Antonius, said. It is expected that unsold Honda Civics, made at Marysville and nearby East Liberty, Ohio, will also be stored at the depot.
1991-02-24	Chevrolet Ranks High and Low in New Crash Tests	A front-seat passenger in the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice is vulnerable to serious or even fatal head injury in a crash, while the Chevrolet Beretta's air bag and seat belts make serious injury unlikely, according to Government tests of seven new vehicles. And the test results show that both the driver and the front-seat passenger in the Chevrolet Blazer 4x4, a multipurpose vehicle, are vulnerable -- even more so than in the Caprice.
1991-02-22	Honda to Lift Civic's Mileage	The Honda Motor Company said today that it would replace its Civic CRX HF subcompact model this fall with a version that would achieve 65 miles a gallon in highway driving and 50 miles a gallon in the city. The mileage ratings, if achieved, would represent a sizable increase in the fuel efficiency of the Civic CRX HF, which now travels 52 miles on a gallon in highway driving and 49 miles on a gallon in the city, the highest figures of any vehicle with a four-cylinder engine.
1991-01-30	Auto Slump Hits Honda And Production Is Cut	One of Japan's most successful auto makers is experiencing one of the most important rites of passage since it became a United States manufacturer: slumping sales and production cuts. The Honda Motor Company, maker of the best-selling model in the United States for the last two years, the Honda Accord, said it would trim production at three assembly plants, including its factory in Marysville, Ohio. The cuts reflect consumer jitters over the war in the Persian Gulf and a deepening recession in the American automotive industry.
1991-01-10	New Impetus in Honda Car-Building Effort	"The Honda Motor Company, responding to ""a number of socio-economic changes"" that have complicated business, including the new Clean Air Act in the United States, announced today that it was intensifying efforts to develop vehicles that will set new environmental, energy and safety standards. Honda provided few details, except to say it was working on a highly energy-efficient compact model that would be introduced ""in the near future."" The auto maker will also begin public testing of what it says is the world's first electric motorcycle this year in Japan."
1991-01-08	U.S. Honda to Ship Wagons to Japan	The Honda Motor Company plans to import into Japan Accord station wagons produced at its United States plant, the company said. Honda spokesmen would not comment on the number of station wagons to be imported, or when such imports would begin. A published report today put the number at 6,000 station wagons in 1991, starting in April. Spokesmen said the company would announce its plans on Wednesday. Honda began importing Accord coupes into Japan from its plant in Marysville, Ohio, in April 1988. Last year, the company imported 10,000 Accord coupes. It plans to increase that number to 12,000 in 1991, a spokesman, Kermit Whitfield, said. Honda produces all of its Accord coupes and station wagons at the Ohio plant.
1990-12-14	Honda's New Wagon: A U.S. Auto, Almost	"The Honda Motor Company introduced a station wagon today that represents another step in the Japanese company's drive to become the first foreign company to create a self-sufficient United States auto maker. The Accord station wagon is the first Honda to be designed and assembled completely in this country, although some components are imported from Japan. It was designed at the company's studios in Torrance, Calif., and is being built at Honda's plant in this city 35 miles northwest of Columbus. ""For years we were supporting projects that started in Japan,"" said Ben Knight, assistant project leader for the station wagon."
1990-11-11	About Cars; Acura's NSX: All-Aluminum Exotica	WHAT is so amazing about Acura's new NSX is not its blinding speed or the ripping mountain-lion snarl of the engine when you put your foot into it. What is so amazing is not the complex suspension that makes the NSX handle as well as anything yet put on the road. Nor is it the fact that hungry customers are pushing and shoving to pay double the car's sticker price. No, what is so surprising about this tiger, this first true exoticar from Japan, is that it is such a pussycat to drive. The NSX is maybe the best sports car that ever was, but it behaves with all the civility of a Honda Accord -- which with good reason has become America's top-selling automobile.
1990-11-06	Japan's Rich Cars Enrich Dealers	Dealers that bet on the Japanese push into the luxury-car market are winning big. At a time when many dealerships in the United States are hurting, those selling the Lexus from Toyota, the Infiniti from Nissan and the Acura from Honda are being viewed as models both for their profitability and the lengths to which they and their car companies will go to impress customers. When Rohrich Lexus opened in Pittsburgh, it did not expect to make money for at least two years. Many analysts warned that Japanese luxury franchises might fail because dealers would be required to invest an unusually large amount -- several million dollars to build a showroom. And they would have little immediate prospect of making a profit because the brands were new and unfamiliar and there would not be much revenue from repairs or used cars, which often provide more profit than new-car business.
1990-11-03	American Honda Is Raising Prices	The American Honda Motor Company is raising prices on its 1991 model cars by about 1.3 percent over comparably equipped 1990 models. Honda attributed the price increase, averaging $173 a vehicle, on fluctuations in the exchange rate between the dollar and the Japanese yen. Prices range from $6,995 for a 1991 Honda Civic hatchback to $19,795 for an Accord Special Edition 4-door Sedan. Honda said its Acura division also was affected by the price increases, with 1991 model Integras and NSX's costing 1.2 percent more, up $199 per vehicle.
1990-10-30	DEVICE IN AIR BAGS PROMPTS RECALLS	The Ford Motor Company and three other manufacturers are recalling more than 55,000 late model cars after the discovery that scores of air bag inflators may fail to work in a head-on crash and may also release dangerous gases. Federal highway safety officials said late Friday that they knew of no incidents in which the problem air bags had failed. But they urged owners of the affected cars to limit use of the vehicles until they are inspected or repaired.
1990-09-25	All U.S. Hondas to Get Air Bags by Fall of '93	LEAD: The new president of the Honda Motor Company said today that starting in the fall of 1993 all Hondas sold in the United States would be equipped with air bags on both the driver's and front passenger's sides.
1990-08-27	THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising - Addenda;   Cox Landley Awarded Acura Dealers Account	LEAD: Cox Landey & Partners has won the $8 million to $10 million account for the Tri-State Acura Dealers. The campaign created by the New York agency will begin in October.
1990-08-07	Honda Denies Truck Plans	LEAD: An automotive trade journal reported today that the Honda Motor Company plans to enter the truck market and increase its United States sales by 50 percent by 1995, but Honda denied the report.
1990-08-02	From Honda, an Exotic Challenge	LEAD: The Acura NSX sports car that will be roaring down American roads later in August has swooping lines, a heart-stopping 168-mile-an-hour top speed and a long list of other characteristics that the Honda Motor Company says a competitive ''super car'' should have.
1990-07-09	Satisfaction Lead to Acura	LEAD: The Acura luxury car division of the Honda Motor Company of Japan has topped the J. D. Power & Associates list of cars most satisfying to owners for the fourth year in a row, the marketing company said last week.
1990-06-16	Chrysler Pact With Honda To Sell Jeeps	LEAD: The Honda Motor Company Ltd. has agreed to make part of its dealer network in Japan available to the Chrysler Corporation to sell two Jeep sport-utility vehicles, the companies said today.
1990-05-31	Honda Increasing Ohio Operations	LEAD: The Honda Motor Company said it would nearly double the size of its research and development operations in Marysville, Ohio. The Japanese auto maker said the expansion would provide additional capacity to design and develop new vehicles for the North American market.
1990-05-26	What if They Ran Indy And Japan Came, Too?	LEAD: None of the 33 cars in the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday will have a Japanese engine, but future races may be very different. The event, as much a noisy reunion for car-crazy Americans as a test of speed and endurance, is attracting new attention from Japanese auto makers eager to increase their appeal in the United States and

1986-07-04	JUNE 21-30 AUTO SALES ROSE 21.2%	Sales of new American-made cars rose 21.2 percent in late June from the comparable period of last year, a time when sales were soft. Light-truck sales were also up, the makers said today, by 10.5 percent.

For all of June, sales of domestically produced autos increased 8.8 percent and light-truck sales were 3 percent above June 1985. The annual selling rate for cars was 8.1 million, up from 7.6 million in June 1985 but down slightly from an 8.2 million rate in May. The rate is seasonally adjusted.

1986-03-30	HONDA IN UPSCALE MARKET	IT is always an event when a new car arrives on the scene, particularly when that car comes from one of your favorite manufacturers. In this case, it is Honda's entry into the upscale market, and the vehicles - which went on sale Thursday - are the top-of-the-line Legend and the far-less-pricey Integra, both bearing the Acura brand. Honda is trying to stay out of its own way with the Acura, and the only place you will find the maker's name is under the hood and on the doorsills. The thinking, oddly enough, concerns Honda's reputation for reasonably priced excellence. With Acura, the company is evincing a heavy yen for the big buck, and economy is not an image devoutly to be wished.
1986-03-29	UNION ORGANIZING: SETBACK AT HONDA CASTS LONG U.S. SHADOW	The United Automobile Workers's suspension of its highly visible organizing drive at the Honda Motors plant at Marysville, Ohio, is a major setback for the union and seems to portend greater organizing difficulties. The union is placing the most favorable interpretation on the situation, saying there was a ''poor climate'' for a vote of the 3,300 hourly workers to see if they wished union representation. It said it would assign more organizers and ultimately organize the plant. But the U.A.W. has not organized a Japanese-owned automobile plant where a company has opposed union organization. And labor expects said that if the union had seen a chance of winning it would have gone ahead.
1986-03-23	U.A.W. Ends Drive At a Honda Plant	In a move that was widely seen as a major setback in its drive to represent workers at foreign-owned plants, the United Automobile Workers decided last week to halt a six-year organization drive at a Honda Motors plant in Marysville, Ohio. In a petition to the National Labor Relations Board, the union withdrew its request that a date be set for a representation election among the 3,300 workers there.
1986-03-19	AUTO WORKERS GIVE UP HONDA PLANT ORGANIZING	The United Automobile Workers has halted its six-year drive to organize workers at a Honda Motors plant in Ohio in a major setback to its drive to represent workers at the growing number of Japanese-owned plants in the United States. The election would have been the first union representation election at a Japanese-owned auto plant in this country. Other Japanese companies that have built plants here have watched the campaign closely to measure union strength and the adaptation of American workers to Japanese management practices. The union, citing a ''poor climate,'' said late Monday that it was ''temporarily'' dropping efforts among 3,300 Honda workers in Marysville, Ohio. The formal action was withdrawal of its petition to the National Labor Relations Board to schedule a vote.
1986-02-04	UNFAIRNESS CHARGE AT HONDA IS DISMISSED BY LABOR BOARD	The National Labor Relations Board has dismissed a charge of unfair labor practices brought by the United Automobile Workers against the Honda Motors Company, an action that appears to clear the way for a union representation vote at the company's plant in Marysville, Ohio. It would be the first referendum on union representation at a Japanese-owned automobile plant in the United States. In a brief statement the director of the labor's board's regional office in Cleveland said he found ''insufficient evidence to issue a complaint.''
1985-12-18	UNION VOTE AT HONDA PLANT POSTPONED AFTER U.A.W. FILES CHARGE	The National Labor Relations Board has ''indefinitely postponed'' a union representation vote scheduled for Thursday at an Ohio Honda motors plant after the United Automobile Workers formally charged the company with an unfair labor practice. The complaint, filed Dec. 13 with the labor board's regional office in Cleveland, accuses Honda of illegally interrogating workers about their attitudes toward unions, allowing antiunion material to be distributed on company time and granting increased holiday and vacation benefits in the midst of the organizing drive in order to discourage union activity. Honda officials at the plant in Marysville, Ohio, angrily denied the charges.
1985-12-03	American Honda Increases Prices	The American Honda Motor Company said that it was increasing the price of its 1986 automobiles by 4 percent, or an average of $403 a car, as a result of the falling value of the dollar.
1985-08-10	THE DISAPPEARING 'U.S. CAR'	The All-American car is becoming increasingly hard to find - and the imported version increasingly hard to spot. Consider the Chevrolet, in its various manifestations. Buyers of a Chevrolet Celebrity pretty much have a domestic car, although Chevrolet executives say virtually all cars assembled in this country carry some imported parts. But anyone who has a Chevrolet Sprint or Spectrum in the driveway has a Japanese automobile. It was made either by the Suzuki Motor Company or Isuzu Motors Ltd. and imported by the General Motors Corporation to compensate for G.M.'s inability to make small cars as efficiently as the Japanese.
1985-07-04	LATE-JUNE CAR SALES FELL 11.8%	Sales of new American-made automobiles, hindered by increased shipments from Japan, fell 11.8 percent in the last 10 days of June, the manufacturers reported today. For the full month, sales of domestically produced cars slipped 3.2 percent, on a daily selling rate basis. Imports jumped 17.5 percent in June, increasing their share of the domestic market to 27.1 percent, from 25 percent in May. ''These figures were not really a surprise,'' said Wendy Beale of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''We had been expecting a slowdown in the domestic sales rates, after the first quarter, because of the increase in imports.''
1985-06-13	OHIO PLANT FOR HONDA CAR ENGINE	The Honda Motor Company said today that it would begin to make automobile engines in Ohio late next year, becoming the first Japanese-owned car company to produce major components in this country. Honda said it would expand its newly completed motorcycle engine plant in Shelby County, Ohio, to produce 60,000 engines a year for its Civic subcompact automobile. The investment, which Honda officials put at $40 million, continues the company's rapid expansion of its American manufacturing operations.
1985-05-24	U.S. CAR SALES UP 18.2% IN MID-MAY	A fresh round of buying incentives lifted sales of new American-made automobiles 18.2 percent in the May 11-20 period, the manufacturers reported today. Sales of light trucks jumped 37.4 percent. The incentives - in the form of below-market-rate financing - were introduced early in the month, but began to show results in mid-May. A sales analyst for the Ford Motor Company suggested that last week's reduction in the prime interest rate, and the subsequent rally in the stock market, helped renew consumer confidence.
1985-05-04	APRIL 21-30 CAR SALES UP BY 1.5%	Sales of new American-made cars rose 1.5 percent in the April 21-30 selling period, according to a compilation of reports issued today by the manufacturers. Most of the companies reported decreases in sales, but hefty gains by the Chrysler Corporation and the American Honda Motor Company offset those declines. Sales by all the companies totaled 282,654 autos in the period, which had eight selling days this year and last. In the comparable 1984 period, 278,540 cars were sold. Based on the latest selling period, auto sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.2 million units.

Several of the auto makers offered financial incentives to customers during the period. The six companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen and American Honda - sold a total of 193,896 new cars in the period, which had eight selling days this year and nine in 1984. The industrywide daily selling rate of 24,237 units was the highest for the early March period since 1981, when the companies were offering cash rebates to buyers.
1985-02-14	Auto Sales Up 2.3% in Early February	Despite extremely cold weather over much of the nation, new-car sales for the six major domestic producers increased 2.3 percent in the first 10 days of February compared with the corresponding period in 1984, the companies reported today. The increase is on the basis of average daily sales, with eight selling days in this year's period and nine last year. The companies sold 165,221 new cars in the Feb. 1-10 period, or 20,653 a day. That compares with 181,694, or 20,188 daily, last year.
1985-02-10	Small Cars Toughen Up	One attribute that Japanese cars have not been famous for is the ability to withstand crashes. But that seems to be changing.
1985-02-06	JAN. 21-31 CAR SALES OFF 4.1%	Sales of new American-made automobiles slipped 4.1 percent on a daily rate basis in late January from an extremely strong period last year, the six major auto makers reported today. The daily selling rate for the Jan. 21-31 period was 26,850, compared with 28,002 in 1984. For all of January, sales were up 3.5 percent.

1985-01-24	JAN. 11-20 CAR SALES ROSE 4.1%	New-car sales by the nation's six major manufacturers rose 4.1 percent in the Jan. 11-20 selling period, the companies reported today. The average daily rate of sales was the highest for the period since 1973. The companies sold 168,668 new automobiles, or 21,084 a day, up from 182,273, or 20,253 a day, last year. There were with eight selling days in the period this year and nine last year. In the 1973 period, there were 23,390 cars sold a day.

The annual selling rate, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, was 8.9 million units, up from a rate of 8 million in the last 10 days of December and from a strong 8.2 million in the period a year ago. The daily selling rate for the early- January period of 23,859 was the highest since 1966, when the domestic companies sold cars at a daily rate of 28,922. Industry analysts had expected sales to be flat or down slightly from last year's robust level. Some cautioned that the better-than-expected sales were the result of slow sales in December because of cold weather and the holidays.
1985-01-04	Dec. 11-20 Auto Sales Fell 3% Shortage of Inventory Seen	Sales of new cars by the nation's six major auto manufacturers fell a slight 3 percent in the Dec. 11-20 period, the companies reported today. Industry analysts noted that while sales were down slightly, the comparable 1983 period was exceptionally strong and that some car lines were in short supply this year. ''Sales were not so much a reflection of demand, but an inventory-induced aberration,'' said Ted Sullivan, an economist with Data Resources Inc. The companies reported a daily sales rate of 21,801 in the mid-December period, down from the 22,469 daily rate in the comparable 1983 period. There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight last year.
1985-01-01	Honda Recalls '82 Accords	The American Honda Motor Company Friday announced the recall of 178,000 Accord automobiles of the 1982 model year to replace an electrical cable connecting the alternator and the battery. The cable is too small to handle maximum current, which could cause the battery to run down, the company said. Honda said it was making the recall voluntarily and that the repair would be made free by Honda dealers.
1984-12-14	Dec. 1-10 Car Sales Rebound by 19.9%	Sales of new cars bounced back in the first 10 days of December with the nation's six major manufacturers today reporting sales of 184,470 units, up 19.9 percent from the period last year, on a daily rate basis. The annual selling rate for cars, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, rose to 9 million units, from an unusually low 6.4 million rate at the end of November. Automotive analysts, who often caution that one 10-day sales report does not indicate a trend, said the 30-day running average of about 7.8 million units was back to more normal levels. ''The erratic sales pattern of the past 40 days will have to show some stability for the next 20 days before anyone can really say where the market is going,'' said L.R. Windecker, an analyst for the Ford Motor Company. ''But the trend of the past 30 days is better than we saw through September and October.''
1984-12-05	NOV. 21-30 CAR SALES OFF 14.2%	New-car sales by the nation's major auto makers fell 14.2 percent in the last 10 days of November, surprising industry executives and analysts who were expecting the trend to continue upward from mid-November. Sales have been restrained recently by inventory shortages created by strikes at the General Motors Corporation and by a shortage of parts. Throughout November the companies produced cars at record levels and sales surged in the middle of the month, slightly above projections. But the companies reported today that, in the selling period that ended Nov. 30, deliveries totaled 186,721, down from 217,540 last year. That brought the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate to 6.4 million, down from 7.9 million for mid-November and 7.3 million for the end-of-November period in 1983.
1984-11-30	DETROIT LETS TOP DOWN AGAIN	When the Chrysler Corporation revived the convertible after a six-year absence in 1982, the car was regarded by many in the auto industry as little more than a novelty, an attention-getting attempt by a failing company. After all, the doubters said, air- conditioning was making convertibles an anachronism, and the Government was about to regulate them out of existence on safety grounds. Even Chysler hedged its bet somewhat, initially using a subcontractor to do the soft-top conversion of its K-cars, so it could save the tooling investment that would have been needed in its own plants. The bet need not have been hedged. The convertible became an instant success for Chrysler, quadrupling initial sales expectations of 3,000 units, and helping the corporation to a spectacular financial recovery. And, surprisingly, the convertible has not been a one-time success, appealing only to nostalgia buffs.
1984-11-28	NOV. 11-20 AUTO SALES IMPROVED SHARP 28.8%	Automobile sales improved sharply in the Nov. 11- 20 period, the manufacturers reported here today. Sales by the six major companies jumped 28.8 percent in mid- November from the period last year. Industry analysts said the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 7.9 million was near normal, following a strike-induced slump that brought the rate down to 6.9 million early this month and the same level for all of October.
1984-11-15	Nov. 1-10 Car Sales Fell by 4.7 Percent	Sales of new cars by the nation's six major auto manufacturers slipped 4.7 percent in the first 10 days of November, the companies reported here today. Sales by the six companies totaled 188,775 in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last, down from 198,126 in 1983. The decline was attributed to supply problems at the General Motors Corporation because of strikes against G.M. in September and October and to a shortage of parts needed for the 1985 models by G.M. supplier companies.
1984-11-06	OCT.21-31 CAR SALES INCREASED 3.3%	Sales of new American-made automobiles rose 3.3 percent in the Oct. 21-31 period from the comparable period a year before, despite strikes against the General Motors Corporation's Canadian plants that held down G.M. sales. The daily combined selling rate of 27,184 reported by the six domestic auto companies today was the highest in the late October period since 1979. Total sales for the period were 244,659, compared with 236,895 in 1983. There were nine selling days in each period.
1984-11-06	HONDA DEALERS SIGN WITH NEEDHAM HARPER	Needham Harper Worldwide's New York office has been tapped to do advertising for the Tri-State Honda Dealers of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware and also for the Greater Pittsburgh Honda Dealers. Only the Pittsburgh gang had a previous agency, the Robert L. Stevenson agency. Needham estimates that total billings should be between $2.5 million and $3 million.
1984-10-25	Auto Sales Fall 6.5%; G.M. Strikes Blamed	Sales of new American-made automobiles, held down by strikes at the nation's largest car maker, fell 6.5 percent in the Oct. 11-20 period, according to figures released today by the nation's six major automobile manufacturers. Selected General Motors Corporation assembly plants in the United States were shut down for six days late last month by the United Automobile Workers when negotiators failed to reach an agreement on a new labor contract. And workers in Canada walked off the job Oct. 17, when talks stalled on a new labor contract there. Many American assembly plants are dependent on components produced only in Canada, and G.M. began closing those plants late last week.
1984-10-16	OCT. 1-10 CAR SALES ROSE 4.1%	New-car sales in the Oct. 1-10 period rose 4.1 percent, on a sales-per-day basis, compared with the same period last year, the nation's six major manufacturers reported today. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate, however, fell to 6.6 million units, from 6.7 million in the last 10 days of September and 7.9 million for the month as a whole, but analysts played down the significance of the decline, citing a distortion in the factors used to compute the rate. ''It used to be that because of the way new cars were introduced in the fall, with much anticipation and hoopla, sales were very strong in the last part of the year and the seasonal adjustment factors took that into effect,'' Ann Knight, an auto analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said. ''Certainly between now and the end of the year the seasonal adjustment factors will tend to penalize sales for the old- fashioned new model introduction, which no longer takes place.''
1984-09-23	HONDA CIVIC COUPE IS RATED BEST IN U.S. TEST FOR MILEAGE	A Honda model, for the second straight year, captured the best mileage ranking among automobiles sold in the United States, according to the annual ratings released today by the Environmental Protection Agency. Foreign-made engines, six of them diesels, powered all the 10 top mileage- yielding 1985 autos that will go on sale this fall. The two-seater Honda Civic Coupe HF recorded 49 miles per gallon in the environmental agency's city driving test and 54 m.p.g. in the highway test.
1984-09-14	Sept. 1-10 Sales of New Cars Up 29.7%	The major American automobile manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars in the first 10 days of September rose 29.7 percent from the same period last year, on a daily rate basis. The average daily selling rate of 21,463 was the highest since 1979. The rate last year was 16,542, when sales were restrained by low inventory.
1984-09-06	AUG. 21-31 CAR SALES UP 11.6%	New-car sales rose 11.6 percent, on a daily selling rate basis, in the Aug. 21-31 period, the six major American manufacturers reported here today. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said dealers delivered a total of 237,078 new cars, bringing the seasonally adjusted annual rate to 7.8 million units. However, the adjusted rate for the entire month of August was 7.7 million units - down from 8.4 million in July and the lowest for any month this year, although much improved from August 1983, when it was 6.6 million. Industry analysts said the August decline, while slightly greater than some estimates, was expected because car sales have been higher than normal for several months. They said low inventory levels and spot shortages of the best-selling cars slowed August sales.
1984-08-24	U.S. CAR SALES UP 32.1% IN AUG. 10-20 PERIOD	Sales of new American-made automobiles bounced back in the second 10 days of August, with the six major manufacturers today reporting an increase of 32.1 percent, on a daily selling rate basis, from the same period last year. The daily rate of 23,651 sales was the highest since 1979. Sales were down slightly in the first 10 days of this month, as inventory levels continued to fall below desired levels. Most of the auto makers have closed some operations to change over to 1985 models. The annual rate of sales, seasonally adjusted, rose to 8.1 million domestic units, from 7.4 million in the Aug. 1-10 period, and up from a 6.6 million rate last year at this time.
1984-08-04	JULY 21-31 AUTO SALES SHOW INCREASE OF 15.7%	Sales by the six major domestic automobile manufacturers rose 15.7 percent in the July 21-31 period, the best performance for the period since 1979, the car makers reported today. Analysts cited recent favorable economic factors for the sales strength. They added, however, that the pace was not likely to be sustained much longer because of diminishing inventories. ''Consumers have every reason to be out there buying cars,'' said John Hammond, an analyst with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ''Inflation's low, interest rates have stopped rising for the moment, and it looks like there's a price break in the energy market. The problem is that the manufacturers just do not have the cars.''
1984-07-13	Honda Profits Increase 37.9%	
1984-07-06	SUPPLIERS JOIN HONDA IN OHIO	When Japan's Honda Motor Company came to Ohio, it did not come alone. Some of its Japanese-based suppliers are also establishing plants in the state. Since last September, Honda and these other companies have announced six separate projects in Ohio, including a doubling of capacity at Honda's sprawling car assembly plant at Marysville, near Columbus, to 300,000 cars a year.
1984-06-17	INJURY-SUIT RULES EASED IN JERSEY TRENTON, June 16 (AP) - New Jersey residents seeking to bring personal injury lawsuits against out-of- state corporations more than two years after their injuries have until August 1985 to file the claims, the State Supreme Court has ruled.	A lawyer representing people who claim injury from asbestos exposure said the ruling would help them bring lawsuits against foreign companies that mined the substance for processing in New Jersey plants. The court's 4-to-3 decision on Wednesday came in the case of Walter Coons of Metuchen, who was injured in an auto accident in 1974 and brought suit four years later against the Honda Motor Company of Japan.
1984-06-14	EARLY JUNE AUTO SALES UP BY 0.3%	The six major American auto manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars edged up only three-tenths of 1 percent in early June from the 1983 period. The sales are figured on a daily selling rate basis. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, American Honda and Volkswagen of America - said sales totaled 187,482 units in the June 1-10 period, or 23,435 units a day, compared with 210,188 and a rate of 23,353 daily a year earlier. There were eight selling days in the 1984 period versus nine last year.
1984-06-06	CAR SALES JUMPED 19.1% IN LAST 10 DAYS OF MAY	New-car sales in the last 10 days of May rose 19.1 percent from the 1983 period on a daily selling rate basis, the major manufacturers reported here today. The daily rate of 37,582 was the highest for the period since 1978. Analysts expressed surprise at the sales figures, which were stronger than anticipated for both the end of the month and all of May. Sales in the month were also the highest since 1978.
1984-05-16	May 1-10 Auto Sales Jumped 25.5%	New-car sales in the first 10 days of May jumped 25.5 percent from the period a year earlier, the nation's major manufacturers reported today. The increase was on a daily rate basis, with nine selling days in the period this year and eight a year ago. The companies, G.M., Ford, Chrysler, A.M.C., Honda and VW, sold 238,240 automobiles in the May 1-10 period, or 26,471 a day. That was the highest daily rate for the period since 1979. Last year the six car makers delivered 168,785 units, or 21,098 a day.
1984-05-04	LATE-APRIL AUTO SALES ROSE 36.6%	Sales of new cars by the nation's major manufacturers rose 36.6 percent in the last 10 days of April from a year earlier, the companies reported today. The increase was measured on a daily rate basis, with eight selling days in the period this year and nine last year. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate, which has been bouncing up and down the last two months, rose to 8.3 million in the April 21-30 period, from 7.7 million in mid-April, to reach 8.1 million for the month, about what analysts had expected. Ann Knight, an auto analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, said: ''These are good strong sales. They are sustainable. When we are in a period resembling normal demand, as we are now, you're going to see some fluctuation from one 10-day period to the next. Between now and the end of the second quarter, anything between a 7.5-million and 8.5-million rate will not surprise me.''
1984-04-14	EARLY APRIL AUTO SALES UP BY 33.2%	Sales of new American-made automobiles jumped 33.2 percent in the first 10 days of April, the six major manufacturers reported today. The daily selling rate of 26,299 was the highest for any early-April period since 1979. Sales in the period rose to 210,395 from 157,875 a year earlier, putting the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate at 8.3 million, up from a 6.6 million rate a year ago and 7.9 million for the past month.
1984-04-05	LATE MARCH AUTO SALES ROSE 18.7%	The nation's major domestic auto makers said today that new car sales in the last 10 days of March rose 18.7 percent from a year earlier, to the best end-of- March selling total since 1981. At the same time, the auto makers said, sales for the entire month rose 26 percent from a year earlier, to the best total for March since 1979. ''These sales looked fine,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an automotive industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. Mr. Phillippi said sales should remain high through this summer because of the large number of consumers who have yet to buy new cars in the current recovery. The six companies - G.M., Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold 313,443 new cars in the March 21-31 period, up from 263,963 a year earlier. For the month, the companies reported sales of 756,164, up from 600,303.
1984-03-15	MARCH 1-10 AUTO SALES ROSE 31.5%	The nation's six major auto makers reported today that sales in the March 1-10 period surged 31.5 percent from a year earlier, continuing the stronger- than-expected pace that has prevailed since December. Analysts and industry executives said the early-March figures showed that sales could be expected to remain strong for the remainder of the model year. The companies - General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen of America and American Honda - said they sold 211,240 cars in the period, which had nine selling days this year and last, when they sold 160,617. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate was 8.1 million domestic units in the period. Most analysts had expected sales in the first quarter of about 7.5 to 7.8 million domestically produced units, but an 8.3 million rate for the month of January and an 8.5 million rate in February caused some to revise their forecasts for the year and brought about some minor adjustments in production schedules by the manufacturers for the second quarter.
1984-03-06	FEB. 21-29 AUTO SALES ROSE 24.6%	The nation's major automobile manufacturers reported today that sales rose 24.6 percent, on a daily rate basis, in late February. The companies, G.M., Ford, Chrysler, A.M.C., VW and Honda, sold a total of 248,062 units in the Feb. 21-29 period, which had eight selling days this year and seven last year. Sales for the entire month of February, with 25 selling days this year and 24 last year, were up 42.5 percent, to 655,016. The daily selling rate of 26,201 was the best daily rate for February since 1979. Last year the car makers sold 441,226 cars, or 18,384 a day, in the month.
1984-02-25	Honda-BL Car for U.S.	Honda, which got a foothold in the American auto market by selling one of the world's smallest cars, has decided to go after the more profitable luxury car market in the United States. The American Honda Motor Company will join with BL Ltd., the British maker of Jaguar cars, to produce an expensive sedan in Britain for export to the United States, a source at Honda said today. The new car will not carry the Honda name because the company wants the public to think of it as unrelated to Honda's small-car line, a spokesman said.
1984-02-22	Honda's Output in U.S.	The Honda Motor Company said today that it would increase production of motorcycles by 70 percent this year at its factory in Marysville, Ohio. The company said it would produce about 70,000 motorcycles with engines of at least 1,000-cubic-centimeter displacement at the plant, compared with 41,000 in 1983.
1984-02-15	FEB. 1-10 AUTO SALES ROSE 32.6%	Sales of new American-made automobiles rose 32.6 percent in the first 10 days of February from the corresponding period last year, the manufacturers reported today. The six major companies, General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, Volkswagen and American Honda, sold 181,694 cars in the Feb. 1-10 period, or 20,188 daily, the best daily selling rate for the early February period since 1979. The companies sold 137,078 cars in Feb. 1-10, 1983. There were nine selling days in both periods.
1984-01-20	Honda Net Up 20% in Quarter	The Honda Motor Company reported today that it had a 20 percent increase in its third- quarter earnings despite declining sales of cars and motorcycles.
1984-01-06	DETROIT CLOSES OUT A BANNER YEAR	For United States auto makers, 1983 was a year when rebates ended and sharp cost cutting combined with solid sales to produce a financial turnaround that analysts said was little short of spectacular. The industry reported today that it continued its rebound last year from the worst sales slump since World War II, selling 6,786,977 cars for the year, an increase of 17.9 percent over the 5,756,658 sold in 1982. Including import sales of 2,368,764, a total of 9,155,741 cars were sold in the United States in 1983, making it the best sales year since 1979, when 10.5 million were sold. Sales in 1982 totaled 7,955,970.
1983-12-17	MOTOR SCOOTERS SET A TREND IN CITY TRANSPORTATION	''I drive straight into my loft with the scooter,'' says Peter Arnell, a New York designer. ''And I bring it up to my office on the back elevator. It costs me about $1 to $1.50 a week to drive.'' Mr. Arnell has bought one of the approximately 20,000 Japanese-made motor scooters sold in the United States in 1983, the first year a new generation of the brightly colored, clean-looking vehicles have been sold in the American market. Several hundred have been purchased in the New York area.
1983-12-05	HONDAS BUILT IN U.S. ACCEPTED	Honda is happy that American car buyers are not turning their backs on its popular Accord just because some of the cars are now being made in Ohio and not Japan. The first Japanese-designed cars built in America are being widely accepted by consumers who previously refused to buy domestically produced cars. ''We had anticipated a heavy resistance to the American Hondas,'' said Paul Brown, a salesman at John D'Elia's Honda Country in Greenwich, Conn., an area in which many drivers own foreign-made cars. ''But quite frankly, we've only had two people come in and say they would only buy Japanese, and they went ahead and bought the American Accord after they drove it.''
1983-11-04	OCT. 21-31 AUTO SALES ROSE 25.5%	Domestic auto sales in the last 10 days of October rose 25.5 percent over a very slow period last year, the companies reported today. The six major auto companies said they sold a total of 236,895 cars in the Oct. 21-31 period versus 188,700 in the same period last year. Both periods had nine selling days. The daily selling rate of 26,322 was the best for the period since a daily pace of 27,969 cars was set in late October 1979. Last year's daily rate for the period was only 20,814 units.
1983-10-26	AUTO SALES ROSE 41.1% IN MID-OCTOBER PERIOD	The nation's six major auto manufacturers reported today that sales of new cars jumped 41.1 percent in the mid-October period from the same period last year, when sales were the lowest in more than two decades. The combined new car sales for Oct. 11 through Oct. 20 were 235,334, compared with 166,785 in the same period last year, when sales were at a 24-year low. In addition, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for mid-October was 7.6 million units, a sharp rise from the 6.7 million-unit rate in the first 10 days of the month.
1983-10-14	AUTO SALES SURGE 45% IN PERIOD	The nation's six major auto manufacturers opened the 1984 model year on a high note, reporting today that sales in the first 10 days of October rose 45 percent from the same period a year earlier. The producers said sales in the period were 191,695 units, up from 132,386 in the 1982 period. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for the period rose to 6.7 million units, from 4.9 million units in the 1982 period and 6.4 million in the last 10 days of September.
1983-10-07	New Honda Plant	Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. said it plans to build a $30 million motorcycle engine factory in Ohio. Output will begin in early 1985 and will create 150 jobs, with workers on a single shift producing 60,000 engines a year, according to a Honda spokesman, Bonnie Manning. She said a site had not been selected.
1983-09-18	JAPANESE AUTO LEADS FUEL EFFICIENCY RATINGS	The 1984 Honda Civic coupe is the most fuel-efficient automobile sold in the United States and the first gasoline- powered car to get the top rating in six years, the Environmental Protection Agency said today. The agency, in making public the Government's annual mileage ratings, said the Japanese two-passenger hatchback got 51 miles to a gallon of gasoline. The model, new on the United States market this fall, displaced the Volkswagen Rabbit Diesel as the most fuel-efficient automobile sold domestically, according to a guide made public by the Environmental Protection Agency.

1979-05-26	Honda's Profit Plunges	The Honda Motor Company yesterday reported a 48.9 percent drop in profits for the fiscal year ended Feb. 28.
